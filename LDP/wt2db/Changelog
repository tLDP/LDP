2002-05-01	0.3	Initial public release.

2002-05-24	0.4	Added -a, --article option.
			This option wraps the document content in <article>
			tags, and prefixes the file with a DocBook 4.1.2
			DOCTYPE declaration.

			Added <articleinfo> as a literal section, so a user
			can write their own meta-data when not using
			Lampadas and still get a complete DocBook file.

CVS			Switched -V and -v, now -v is version, -V is verbose.
