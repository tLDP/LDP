<title>Installation of Expect</title>

<para>First apply a patch:</para>

<screen><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../&expect-patch;</userinput></screen>

<para>This fixes a bug in Expect that can result in bogus failures during the
GCC test suite run.</para>

<para>Now prepare Expect for compilation:</para>

<screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=/tools --with-tcl=/tools/lib --with-x=no</userinput></screen>

<para>The meaning of the configure options:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><userinput>--with-tcl=/tools/lib</userinput>: This ensures that
the configure script finds the Tcl installation in our temporary tools location.
We don't want it to find an existing one that may possibly reside on the host
system.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><userinput>--with-x=no</userinput>: This tells the configure
script not to search for Tk (the Tcl GUI component) or the X Window System
libraries, both of which may possibly reside on the host system.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Build the package:</para>

<screen><userinput>make</userinput></screen>

<para>This package has a test suite available which can perform a number of
checks to ensure it built correctly. However, the Expect test suite here in
Chapter 5 is known to experience failures under certain host conditions that
are not fully understood. Therefore, test suite failures here are not
surprising, but are not considered critical. Should you choose to run the test
suite, the following command will do so:</para>

<screen><userinput>make test</userinput></screen>

<para>And install:</para>

<screen><userinput>make SCRIPTS="" install</userinput></screen>

<para>The meaning of the make parameter:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><userinput>SCRIPTS=""</userinput>: This prevents installation of
the supplementary expect scripts which are not needed.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>You can now remove the source directories of both Tcl and Expect.</para>
