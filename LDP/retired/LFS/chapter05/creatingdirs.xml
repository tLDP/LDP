<para>Let's now create the directory tree on the LFS partition based on
the FHS standard, which can be found at
<ulink url="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">http://www.pathname.com/fhs/</ulink>.
Issuing the following commands will create a default directory layout:</para>
 
<para><screen><userinput>cd $LFS &amp;&amp;
mkdir -p bin boot dev/pts etc/opt home lib mnt proc root sbin tmp var opt &amp;&amp;
for dirname in $LFS/usr $LFS/usr/local
<literal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do</literal>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mkdir $dirname
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cd $dirname
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mkdir bin etc include lib sbin share src
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ln -s share/man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ln -s share/doc
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ln -s share/info
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cd $dirname/share
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mkdir dict doc info locale man nls misc terminfo zoneinfo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cd $dirname/share/man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mkdir man{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
done &amp;&amp;
cd $LFS/var &amp;&amp;
mkdir -p lock log mail run spool tmp opt cache lib/misc local &amp;&amp;
cd $LFS/opt &amp;&amp;
mkdir bin doc include info lib man &amp;&amp;
cd $LFS/usr &amp;&amp;
ln -s ../var/tmp</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Normally, directories are created with permission mode 755, which isn't
desired for all directories. The first change is a mode 0750 for the 
$LFS/root directory. This is to make sure that not just everybody can 
enter the /root directory (the same a user would do with /home/username 
directories). The second change is a mode 1777 for the tmp 
directories. This way, any user can write data to the /tmp or /var/tmp 
directory but cannot remove another user's files (the latter is caused 
by the so-called "sticky bit" - bit 1 of the 1777 bit mask).</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cd $LFS &amp;&amp;
chmod 0750 root &amp;&amp;
chmod 1777 tmp var/tmp</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Now that the directories are created, copy the source files that were
downloaded in chapter 3 to some subdirectory under $LFS/usr/src (you
will need to create the desired directory yourself).</para>

<title>FHS compliance notes</title>

<para>The FHS stipulates that the /usr/local directory should contain the
bin, games, include, lib, man, sbin, and share subdirectories. You can
alter your /usr/local directory yourself if you want your system to be
FHS-compliant.</para>

<para>Also, the standard says that there should exist a /usr/share/games 
directory, which we don't much like for a base system. But feel free to 
make your system FHS-compliant if you wish. The FHS isn't precise as 
to the structure of the /usr/local/share subdirectories, so we took the 
liberty of creating the directories that we felt were needed.</para>
