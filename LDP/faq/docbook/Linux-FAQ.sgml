<question id='what-is-linux'><para>What Is Linux?</para></question>
 <answer><para>Linux is an operating system kernel that behaves and performs similarly to the famous UNIX&trade; operating system from AT&amp;T Bell Labs. It has all of the features of a modern operating system: true multitasking, threads, virtual memory, shared libraries, demand loading, shared, copy-on-write executables, proper memory management, loadable device driver modules, video frame buffering, and TCP/IP networking.  </para>
<para>Most people, however, refer to the operating system kernel, system software, and application software, collectively, as "Linux", and that convention is used in this FAQ as well. </para>
<para>Linus Torvalds and a loosely knit team of volunteer hackers from across the Internet wrote (and still are writing) Linux from scratch. </para>
<para>The Linux kernel is distributed under the GNU General Public License. ("<xref linkend="is-linux-public-domain-copyrighted"  endterm="is-linux-public-domain-copyrighted">")  </para>
<para>There is a historical archive of all versions of the Linux kernel at <ulink url='http://ps.cus.umist.ac.uk/~rhw/kernel.versions.html'><citetitle>http://ps.cus.umist.ac.uk/~rhw/kernel.versions.html</citetitle></ulink>.  </para>

<question id='platform-support'><para>What Platforms Does Linux Support?</para></question>
 <answer><para>Linux was written originally for Intel processor based PC's, using the hardware facilities of the 80386 processor and its successors to implement its features. The 80386 family includes the 80486, and all of the Pentium chips. However, there are now many ports to other hardware platforms. ("<xref linkend="what-ports-to-other-processors-are-there" endterm="what-ports-to-other-processors-are-there">") </para>
<para>There are also Linux distributions specifically for mobile and handheld platforms. An API specification and developers kit for the Crusoe Smart  Microprocessor developed by Transmeta Corporation are at  <ulink url='http://www.transmeta.com'><citetitle>http://www.transmeta.com</citetitle></ulink>. Information on the Linux distribution for the  Compaq iPAQ is at <ulink url='http://www.handhelds.org'><citetitle>http://www.handhelds.org</citetitle></ulink>.  </para>

<question id='linux-versioning'><para>How Do Linux Versions Work?</para></question>
 <answer><para>At any given time, there are several "stable" versions of Linux, and one "development" version. Unlike most proprietary software, older stable versions continue to be supported for as long as there is interest, which is why multiple versions exist. </para>
<para>Linux version numbers follow a longstanding tradition. Each version has three numbers, i.e., X.Y.Z. The "X" is only incremented when a really significant change happens, one that makes software written for one version no longer operate correctly on the other. This happens very rarely -- in Linux's history it has happened exactly once. </para>
<para>The "Y" tells you which development "series" you are in. A stable kernel will always have an even number in this position, while a development kernel will always have an odd number. </para>
<para>The "Z" specifies which exact version of the kernel you have, and it is incremented on every release. </para>
<para>The current stable series is 2.4.x, and the current development series is 2.5.x. However, many people continue to run 2.2.x and even 2.0.x kernels, and they also continue to receive bugfixes. The development series is the code that the Linux developers are actively working on, which is always available for public viewing, testing, and even use, although production use is not recommended! This is part of the "open source development" method. </para>
<para>Eventually, the 2.5.x development series will be "sprinkled with holy penguin pee" and become the 2.6.0 kernel and a new stable series will then be established, and a 2.7.x development series begun. Or, if any really major changes happen, it might become 3.0.0 instead, and a 3.1.x series begun. </para>

<question id='where-do-i-start'><para>How Do I Get Started?</para></question>
 <answer><para>If you are new to Linux, you should start by buying or downloading a general-purpose Linux distribution. A distribution is a complete operating system, including the Linux kernel and all the utilities and software you are likely to need, ready to install and use. Most distributions include thousands of software packages, including user-friendly desktops, office suites, and games. </para>
<para>There are a handful of major Linux distributions, and as a beginner you are probably safer using one of them. For information about them, and how they are installed, see the <ulink url=''><citetitle>ERROR: LDP namespace resolution failure on Distributions-HOWTO</citetitle></ulink> from the Linux Documentation Project. Also, a list of distributions is updated weekly at <ulink url='http://lwn.net'><citetitle>http://lwn.net</citetitle></ulink>. </para>
<para>Before you select which distribution you want to try, read their descriptions carefully and compare them to your needs. Each distribution is tailored to a particular type of user. Some are optimized to function as servers, some are optimized for gaming, and some are optimized for desktop and office use. </para>
<para>There are a few distributions which are considered to be outstanding choices for new users: </para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Red Hat is particularly good for servers </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Mandrake is excellent as a desktop system </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>SuSE is also excellent as a desktop system </para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
 <para>There are also a large number of releases which are distributed less globally that suit special local and national needs. Many of them are archived at <filename>ftp://ftp.tux.org</filename>. </para>

<question id='how-to-get-a-distro'><para>How Can I Get a Distribution?</para></question>
 <answer><para>If you can, please dig into your wallet and buy a copy of your distribution. Linux distributions are extremely inexpensive - usually around $30 for a complete system, and anywhere from $70 to around $150 for a larger system with more server software or development tools. Even the $30 "basic" systems contain the equivalent of thousands of dollars in proprietary tools, and are an incredible value. The distributors invest many of your dollars into further development, and most of them fund outside open source projects. </para>
<para>Commercial distributions are available from book and electronics stores, or you can order from their websites. </para>
<para>If you use Debian GNU/Linux, which is a volunteer project and a non-profit, you can donate directly to them instead. </para>
</answer>
<answer><para>There are some websites that sell Linux CD's very inexpensively. Try: </para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><ulink url='http://www.cheapbytes.com'><citetitle>http://www.cheapbytes.com</citetitle></ulink> </para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
 </answer>
<answer><para>Every distribution provides a download on their home page. This is a requirement of the licensing terms of the software, so if you cannot afford to pay for your distribution, you can get a copy this way. Some people compromise between paying and downloading, for example by buying each major release (such as 6.0) but downloading the point releases (such as 6.1 and 6.2). </para>
<para>Also, archives of many of the distributions are on line at: <filename>ftp://ftp.tux.org</filename> and <ulink url='http://planetmirror.com/pub/linux'><citetitle>http://planetmirror.com/pub/linux</citetitle></ulink>. </para>
</answer>
<answer><para>Some hardware vendors now ship systems with Linux pre-installed. However, they sometimes make it very difficult to buy them - they offer Linux on only a few systems, which are server machines, or they require you to go to a special "Linux" section on their website. </para>

<question id='how-to-install'><para>How Do I Install Linux?</para></question>
 <answer><para>Once you obtain a distribution, it will contain instructions on installation. Each distribution has its own installation program. </para>
</answer>
<answer><para>There is a very thorough installation guide on line at <ulink url='http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/linux.html'><citetitle>http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/linux.html</citetitle></ulink> </para>
</answer>
<answer><para>Some distributions (e.g., Debian GNU/Linux) can be installed via anonymous FTP from various Linux archive sites, but unless you have cable, DSL, or some other broadband Internet access, the size of the distribution makes this impractical. ("<xref linkend="get-linux-material-by-ftp" endterm="get-linux-material-by-ftp">") </para>
<para>Postings on the Usenet News groups, including the FAQ, are archived on <ulink url='http://groups.google.com/'><citetitle>http://groups.google.com/</citetitle></ulink>. Search for  "<literal>comp.os.linux.*</literal>,"  "<literal>alt.uu.comp.os.linux.*</literal>", or whatever is appropriate, to  retrieve articles from the Linux News groups. ("<xref  linkend="what-newsgroups" endterm="what-newsgroups">")  </para>

<question id='what-software-does-linux-support'><para>What Software does Linux Support?</para></question>
 <answer><para>Linux runs all of the standard open source utilities, like GCC, (X)Emacs, the X Window System, all the standard Unix utilities, TCP/IP (including SLIP and  PPP), and all of the hundreds of programs that people have compiled or ported  to it.  </para>
<para>There is a DOS emulator, called DOSEMU, that lets Linux run programs written for DOS. The latest stable release is 0.98.3. The FTP archives are at <filename>ftp://ftp.dosemu.org/dosemu</filename>. The Web site is <ulink url='http://www.dosemu.org'><citetitle>http://www.dosemu.org</citetitle></ulink>. </para>
<para>The emulator can run DOS itself and some (but not all) DOS applications. Be sure to look at the [README] file to determine which version you should get. Also, see the <citetitle>DOSEMU-HOWTO</citetitle> (slightly dated at this pointit doesn't cover the most recent version of the program), at <filename>ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO</filename>. </para>
<para>Work has been progressing on WINE, an emulator for Microsoft Windows binaries. ("<xref linkend="microsoft-windows-programs-underlinux"  endterm="microsoft-windows-programs-underlinux">")  </para>
<para>Intel Binary Compatibility Standard (iBCS2) emulator code for SVR4 ELF and SVR3.2 COFF binaries can be included in the kernel as a compile-time option. There is information at <filename>ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/BETA/ibcs2/README</filename>. For more information see the <filename>INFO-SHEET</filename>. </para>
<para>Some companies have commercial software available. They often announce their availability on <citetitle>comp.os.linux.announce</citetitle> try searching  the archives. ("<xref linkend="are-the-newsgroups-archived-anywhere"  endterm="are-the-newsgroups-archived-anywhere">").  </para>

<question id='ported-compiled-written-xxx'><para>How Do I Find a Particular Application?</para></question>
 <answer><para>Look first in the Linux Software Map. It's at: <filename>ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/linux-software-map/</filename>, and on the other FTP sites. A search engine is available on the World Wide Web at <ulink url='http://www.boutell.com/lsm/'><citetitle>http://www.boutell.com/lsm/</citetitle></ulink>.  </para>
<para>Also check out the <emphasis role='bold'>Freshmeat</emphasis> Web site: <ulink url='http://www.freshmeat.net'><citetitle>http://www.freshmeat.net</citetitle></ulink>, which is where many new announcements of free software first appear. Freshmeat is basically a site index that continuously updates the notices of new or upgraded software for Linux, and maintains indexes of the announcements and links to their URL's. </para>
<para>The FTP sites ("<xref linkend="get-linux-material-by-ftp" endterm="get-linux-material-by-ftp">") often have [ls-lR] or [INDEX] directory listings which you can search using <command>grep</command> or a text editor. The directory listings files can be very large, however, making them unwieldy for quick searches. </para>
<para>Also look at the Linux Projects Map: <filename>ftp://ftp.ix.de/pub/ix/Linux/docs/Projects-Map.gz</filename>. </para>
<para>There's a search engine for Linux FTP archives at: <ulink url='http://lfw.linuxhq.com'><citetitle>http://lfw.linuxhq.com</citetitle></ulink>. </para>
<para>Searching for "Linux" on the World Wide Web provides copious references. ("<xref linkend="world-wide-web-for-linux-stuff" endterm="world-wide-web-for-linux-stuff">") </para>
<para>If you don't find anything, you could download the sources to the program yourself and compile them. See ("<xref linkend="port-xxx-to-linux" endterm="port-xxx-to-linux">"). If it's a large package that may require some porting, post a message to <citetitle>comp.os.linux.development.apps</citetitle>. The popularity of Linux makes this an extremely unlikely occurrence. The great majority of software available on other UNIX-type systems has already been ported to Linux. </para>
<para>If you compile a large-ish program, please upload it to one or more of the FTP sites, and post a message to <citetitle>comp.os.linux.announce</citetitle> (submit your posting to <ulink url='mailto:linux-announce@news.ornl.gov'><citetitle>linux-announce@news.ornl.gov</citetitle></ulink>. </para>
<para>If you're looking for an application program, the chances are that someone has already written a free version. The <citetitle>comp.sources.wanted</citetitle> FAQ has instructions for finding the source code. </para>

<question id='how-much-hard-disk-space-does-linux-need'><para>What are the Disk Space Requirements for Minimal, Server, and Workstation Use?</para></question>
 <answer><para>Linux needs about 10Mb for a very minimal installation, suitable for trying Linux, and not much else. </para>
<para>You can fit a typical server installation, including the X Window Systemt GUI, into 80Mb. Installing Debian GNU/Linux takes 500Mb1GB, including kernel  source code, some space for user files, and spool areas.  </para>
<para>Installing a commercial distribution that has a desktop GUI environment, commercial word processor, and front-office productivity suite, will claim  15.1 GB of disk space, approximately.  </para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>
<qandaentry>
<question id='how-much-memory-does-linux-need'><para>What are the Minimum and Maximum Memory Requirements?</para></question>
 <answer><para>Linux needs at least 4MB, and then you will need to use special installation procedures until the disk swap space is installed. Linux will run comfortably in 4MB of  RAM, although running GUI apps is impractically slow because they need to  swap out to disk.  </para>
<para>Some applications, like StarOffice, require 32 MB of physical memory, and compiling C++ code can easily consume over 100 MB of combined physical and  virtual memory.  </para>
<para>There is a distribution, "Small Linux", that will run on machines with 2MB of RAM. Refer to the answer to: "<xref linkend="get-linux-material-by-ftp"  endterm="get-linux-material-by-ftp">"  </para>
<para>A number of people have asked how to address more than 64 MB of memory, which is the default upper limit in most standard kernels. Either type, at the  <literal>BOOT lilo:</literal> prompt:  </para>
<para>
 <screen> mem=XXM</screen>
 </para>
 <para>Or place the following in your [/etc/lilo.conf] file: </para>
<para>
 <programlisting> append="mem=XXM" </programlisting>
 </para>
 <para>The parameter "<emphasis role='bold'>XX</emphasis>M" is the amount of memory, specified as megabytes; for example, "128M."  </para>
<para>If an "<literal>append=</literal>" directive with other configuration options already exists in [/etc/lilo.conf], then add the  <literal>mem=</literal> directive to the end of the existing argument, and  separated from the previous arguments by a space; e.g.:  </para>
<para>
 <programlisting> # Example only; do not use.
 append="parport=0x3bc,none serial=0x3f8,4 mem=XXM" </programlisting>
 </para>

<question id='is-linux-public-domain-copyrighted'><para>What Is Linux's Open-Source License?</para></question>
 <answer><para>The Linux trademark belongs to Linus Torvalds. He has placed the Linux kernel under the GNU General Public License, which basically means that you may  freely copy, change, and distribute it, but you may not impose any  restrictions on further distribution, and you must make the source code  available.  </para>
<para>There is a FAQ for the GPL at: <ulink url='http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gnu-faq.html'><citetitle>http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gnu-faq.html</citetitle></ulink>. </para>
<para>This is not the same as Public Domain. See the Copyright FAQ, <filename>ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/law/copyright</filename>,  for details.  </para>
<para>Full details are in the file [COPYING] in the Linux kernel sources (probably in [/usr/src/linux] on your system).  </para>
<para>The licenses of the utilities and programs which come with the installations vary. Much of the code is from the GNU Project at the Free Software  Foundation, and is also under the GPL. Some other major programs often included  in Linux distributions are under a BSD license and other licenses.  </para>
<para>Note that discussion about the merits or otherwise of the GPL should be posted to the news group gnu.misc.discuss, and not to the  <citetitle>comp.os.linux</citetitle> hierarchy.  </para>

<question id='where-can-i-get-the-latest-kernel-version'><para>Where Is the Latest Kernel Version on the Internet?</para></question>
 <answer><para>The easiest way to update your kernel is to get the update directly from the distribution which you are running. </para>
</answer>
<answer><para>If you need or want to configure and compile your own kernel, the web page at <ulink url='http://www.kernel.org/'><citetitle>http://www.kernel.org/</citetitle></ulink> lists the current versions of the development and production kernels. </para>
<para>If you want to download the source code, FTP to <literal>ftp.xx.kernel.org</literal>, where ``<literal>xx</literal>'' is the  two-letter Internet domain abbreviation of your country; e.g.,  ``<literal>us</literal>'' for United States, ``<literal>ca</literal>'' for  Canada, or ``<literal>de</literal>'' for Germany. Kernel versions 2.2.x are  archived in the directory [pub/linux/kernel/v2.2], as are  patches for the prerelease versions. The kernel source code is archived as a  <literal>.tar.gz</literal> file, and as a <literal>.tar.bz2</literal> file.  </para>
<para>Follow the instructions in any of the standard references to compile the kernel, as you would with any other custom kernel. The  [Documentation] subdirectory contains information by the  authors of various subsystems and drivers, and much of that information is  not documented elsewhere.  </para>
<para>If you want to participate in kernel development, make sure that you sign on to the linux-kernel mailing list to find out what people are working on.  Refer to the answer: ``<xref linkend="what-mailing-lists-are-there"  endterm="what-mailing-lists-are-there">''  </para>

<question id='can-linux-share-my-disk-with-dos'><para>Can Linux Use the Same Hard Drive as MS-DOS? OS/2? 386BSD? Win95?</para></question>
 <answer><para>Yes. Linux supports many, many filesystems, including the standard MS-DOS partitioning scheme, so it can share your disk with other operating systems. </para>
<para>Linux supports all known versions of the Microsoft FAT and VFAT file systems, including those used by Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows ME through loadable kernel modules. In a correctly configured system, they should load automatically when the partitions are mounted.  </para>
<para>Note, however, that many other operating systems may not be exactly compatible. DOS's [FDISK.EXE] and  [FORMAT.EXE], for example, can overwrite data in a Linux  partition, because they sometimes incorrectly use partition data from the  partition's boot sector rather than the partition table.  </para>
<para>In order to prevent programs from doing this, it is a good idea to zero out under Linux the start of a partition you created, before you use  MS-DOS or whatever to format it. Type:  </para>
<para>
 <screen> $ dd
 if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdXY bs=512 count=1</screen>
 </para>
 <para>where <emphasis role='bold'>hdXY</emphasis> is the relevant partition; e.g., [/dev/hda1] for the first partition of the first (IDE)  disk.  </para>
<para>Linux can read and write the files on your DOS and OS/2 FAT partitions and floppies using either the DOS file system type built into  the kernel or <command>mtools</command>.  </para>
<para>There is reportedly a GPL'd OS/2 device driver that will read and write Linux ext2 partitions.  </para>

</answer>
<answer><para>In the meantime, if you need to run MS Windows programs, the safest bet is to dual-boot. LILO, the Linux boot loader, can boot one of  several operating systems from a menu. See the LILO documentation for  details. Also, [LOADLIN.EXE] (a DOS program  to load a Linux, or other OS, kernel is one way to make Linux co-exist with  DOS. [LOADLIN.EXE] is particularly handy when you want to  install Linux on a 3rd or 4th drive on a system (or when you're adding a SCSI  drive to a system with an existing IDE).  </para>
<para>In these cases, it is common for LILO's boot loader to be unable to find or load the kernel on the  "other" drive. So you just create a [C:LINUX] directory  (or whatever), put [LOADLIN.EXE] in it with a copy of your  kernel, and use that.  </para>
<para>[LOADLIN.EXE] is a VCPI compliant program. Win95 will want to, "shutdown into DOS mode," to run  it (as it would with certain other DOS protected-mode programs).  </para>
<para>Earlier versions of [LOADLIN.EXE] sometimes required a package called [REALBIOS.COM], which required a  boot procedure on an (almost) blank floppy to map the interrupt vectors  (prior to the loading of any software drivers).

 <answer><para>If your disk is an IDE or EIDE drive, you should read the file [/usr/src/linux/drivers/block/README.ide]  (part of the Linux kernel source code). This [README]  contains many helpful hints about IDE drives. Many modern IDE controllers do  translation between `physical' cylinders/heads/sectors, and `logical' ones.  </para>
<para>SCSI disks are accessed by linear block numbers. The BIOS invents some `logical' cylinder/head/sector fiction to support DOS.  </para>
<para>Older IBM PC-compatible BIOS's will usually not be able to access partitions which extend beyond 1024 logical cylinders, and will make booting  a Linux kernel from such partitions using LILO problematic at best.  </para>
<para>You can still use such partitions for Linux or other operating systems that access the controller directly.  </para>

 <answer><para>You may have a corrupted file system, probably caused by not shutting Linux down properly before turning off the power or resetting.

<question id='add-temporary-swap-space'><para>How Do I Add Temporary Swap Space?</para></question>
 <answer><para>In addition to a swap partition, Linux can also use a swap file. Some programs, like <application>g++</application>,  can use huge amounts of virtual memory, requiring the temporary creation of  extra space. To install an extra 64 MB of swap space, for example, use the  following shell commands:  </para>
<para>
 <screen> # dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap bs=1024 count=65535
  # mkswap /swap
  # swapon /swap</screen>
 </para>
 <para>The <command>count=</command> argument to <command>dd</command> determines how big the swap file will be. In this example the swap file's name is  [/swap], but the name and location are, generally,  arbitrary, depending only on the file system's available space and your  having write permissions in the directory.  </para>
<para>When you don't need the swap space any more, remove it with the following statements: </para>
<para>
 <screen> # swapoff /swap
  # rm /swap</screen>
 </para>
 <para>Take a look also at the <citetitle>Installation HOWTO</citetitle> and <citetitle>Installation &amp; Getting Started</citetitle> for detailed  instructions.  </para>

<question id='remove-lilo-so-my-system-boots'><para>Can I Remove LILO So the System Boots DOS Again?</para></question>
 <answer><para>The <command>lilo</command> program (not the complete <application>LILO</application> package), uses the command line option  <command>-u</command> to uninstall the <application>LILO</application> boot  loader. You have to supply the device name of the device you installed  <application>LILO</application> on, for example:  </para>
<para>
 <screen> lilo -u /dev/hda</screen>
 </para>
 <para>This rewrites the original, pre-<application>LILO</application> master boot record back to the first hard drive, from the boot record saved in [/boot/boot.0300]. If  you installed <application>LILO</application> to a partition as a secondary  boot loader, for example, [/dev/hda1],  <command>lilo</command> re-installs the original boot sector from the save  file [/boot/boot.0301]. Refer to the  <command>lilo</command> manual page for details. Thanks to Villy Kruse for  reminding me to update this answer.  </para>
<para>If you have an earlier version of <application>LILO</application>, you will have to use the DOS (MS-DOS 5.0 or later, or OS/2) <literal>FDISK /MBR</literal> (which is not  documented). This will overwrite the lilo boot loader with a standard <application>MS-DOS</application>  Master Boot Record. If you have <application>DR-DOS 6.0</application>, go  into [FDISK.EXE] in the normal way and then select the  <literal>Re-write Master Boot Record</literal> option.  </para>
<para>If you create a boot floppy during the Windows installation process, make sure that it contains the programs <application>FDISK.EXE</application>,  <application>FORMAT.COM</application>, and  <application>SYS.COM</application>, and use that to re-install MS-DOS on the  hard disk.  </para>
<para>If you don't have MS-DOS or DR-DOS, you need to have the boot sector that LILO saved when you first installed it. You did  keep that file, didn't you? It's probably called  [boot.0301] or some such. Type:  </para>
<para>
 <screen> dd if=boot.0301 of=/dev/hda bs=445 count=1</screen>
 </para>
 <para>(or [/dev/sda] if you're using a SCSI disk). This may also wipe out your partition table, so beware! If you're desperate, you could use  </para>
<para>
 <screen> dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1</screen>
 </para>
 <para>This will erase your partition table and boot sector completely: you can then reformat the disk using your favorite software. But  this will render the contents of your disk inaccessible  you'll lose it all  unless you're an expert.  </para>
<para>Note that the <application>DOS</application> MBR boots whichever (single!) partition is flagged as "active." You may need to use <command>fdisk</command> to set  and clear the active flags on partitions appropriately.  </para>

 <answer><para><warning>You should always have a rescue disk set ready when you perform this procedure, in the likely event that something goes wrong!</warning>  </para>
<para>This procedure is especially difficult if you're upgrading very old libraries like <application>libc4</application>. But you should be able to  keep <application>libc4</application> on the same system with  <application>libc5</application> libraries for the programs that still need  them. The same holds true for upgrading from <application>libc5</application>  to the newer-yet <application>glibc2</application> libraries.  </para>
<para>The problem with upgrading dynamic libraries is that the moment you remove the old libraries, the utilities that you need to upgrade to the new version  of the libraries don't work. There are ways around around this. One is to  temporarily place a spare copy of the run time libraries, which are in  [/lib/], in [/usr/lib/], or  [/usr/local/lib/], or another directory that is listed in the [/etc/ld.so.conf] file.  </para>
<para>For example, when upgrading <application>libc5</application> libraries, the files in [/lib/] might look something like:  </para>
<para>
 <screen>libc.so.5 libc.so.5.4.33 libm.so.5 libm.so.5.0.9</screen>
 </para>
 <para>These are the C libraries and the math libraries. Copy them to another directory that is listed in [/etc/ld.so.conf], like  [/usr/lib/]:  </para>
<para>
 <screen> $ cp -df /lib/libc.so.5* /usr/lib/
  $ cp -df /lib/libm.so.5* /usr/lib/
  $ ldconfig</screen>
 </para>
 <para>Be sure to run <command>ldconfig</command> to upgrade the library configuration.  </para>
<para>The files [libc.so.5] and [libm.so.5] are symbolic links to the actual library files. When you upgrade, the new links  will not be created if the old links are still there, unless you use the  <command>-f</command> flag with <command>cp</command>. The  <command>-d</command> flag to <command>cp</command> will copy the symbolic  link itself, and not the file it points to.  </para>
<para>If you need to overwrite the link to the library directly, use the <command>-f</command> flag with <command>ln</command>.  </para>
<para>For example, to copy new libraries over the old ones, try this. Make a symbolic link to the new libraries first, then copy both the libraries and the links to  [/lib/], with the following commands.  </para>
<para>
 <screen> $ ln -sf ./libm.so.5.0.48 libm.so.5
  $ ln -sf ./libc.so.5.0.48 libc.so.5
  $ cp -df libm.so.5* /lib
  $ cp -df libc.so.5* /lib</screen>
 </para>
 <para>Again, remember to run <command>ldconfig</command> after you copy the libraries.  </para>

 <answer><para>Yes, unless it's the kernel. </para>
<para>The <command>-m486</command> option to <application>GCC</application>, which is used to compile binaries for x486  machines, merely changes certain optimizations. This makes for slightly  larger binaries that run somewhat faster on a 486. They still work fine on a  386, though, with a small performance hit.  </para>
<para>However, from version 1.3.35 the kernel uses 486 or Pentium-specific instructions if configured for a 486 or Pentium, thus making it unusable on a 386.  </para>
<para><application>GCC</application> can be configured for a 386 or 486; the only difference is that configuring it for a 386 makes  <command>-m386</command> the default and configuring for a 486 makes  <command>-m486</command> the default. In either case, these can be overridden  on a per-compilation basis or by editing [/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i*-linux/]  <emphasis role='bold'>n.n.n</emphasis>[/specs].  </para>
<para>There is an alpha version of <application>GCC</application> that knows how to do optimization well for the 586, but it is quite unreliable, especially at high  optimization settings.

 <answer><para>With an <acronym>ELF</acronym> compiler (``<xref linkend="about-elf-glibc" endterm="about-elf-glibc">''), the most common  cause of large executables is the lack of an appropriate .so library link for  one of the libraries you're using. There should be a link like  [libc.so] for every library like [libc.so.5.2.18].  </para>
<para>With an [a.out] compiler the most common cause of large executables is the <command>-g</command> linker (compiler) flag.

<question id='ppp-connection-dies-when-sending'><para>Why Do FTP Transfers Seem to Hang?</para></question>
 <answer><para>FTP transfers that die suddenly are due, apparently, to some form of overrunning buffer. It occurs both with Linux and Microsoft servers. On Linux systems, the problem seems to occur  most commonly with the distribution's server software.  </para>
<para>If you receive <literal>ftp: connection refused</literal> errors, then the problem is likely due to a lack of authentication. Refer to ``<xref  linkend="ftp-wont-login" endterm="ftp-wont-login">.''  </para>
<para>One remedy is to be replacing the distribution FTP server with the Linux port of the OpenBSD FTP server. The home page is:  <ulink url='http://www.eleves.ens.fr:8080/home/madore/programs/'><citetitle>http://www.eleves.ens.fr:8080/home/madore/programs/</citetitle></ulink>.  </para>
<para>To install the BSD server, follow the installation instructions, and refer to the manual pages for [inetd]  and [inetd.conf]. (If you have the newer [xinetd], see below.)  Be sure to tell [inetd] to run the BSD daemon alone, not as a subprocess  of, for example, [tcpd]. Comment out the line that begins  ``<literal>ftp</literal>'' in the [/etc/inetd.conf] file  and replace it with a line similar to (if you install the new  [ftpd] in [/usr/local/sbin/]):  </para>
<para>
 <programlisting>
 # Original entry, commented out. #ftp stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd
 /usr/sbin/in.ftpd
 
 # Replacement entry: ftp stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/sbin/ftpd -l
 </programlisting>
 </para>
 <para>The replacement daemon will become effective after rebooting or sending (as root) a <literal>SIGHUP</literal> to  <literal>inetd</literal>, e.g.:  </para>
<para>
 <screen> # kill -HUP inetd</screen>
 </para>
 <para>To configure [xinetd], create an entry in [/etc/xinetd.d] per the instructions in the [xinetd.conf] manual page. Make sure, again, that the  command-line arguments for [ftpd] are correct, and that  you have installed the [/etc/ftpusers] and  [/etc/pam.d/ftp] files. Then restart [xinetd] with the command:  <literal>/etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd restart</literal>. The command should report  "OK," and the restart will be noted in the system message log.  </para>

<listitem><para>Make sure that the <literal>MOZILLA_HOME</literal> environment variable is correctly set. If you installed Netscape under  [/usr/local/netscape/], for example, that should be the  value of <literal>MOZILLA_HOME</literal>. Set it from the command line (e.g,  "<literal>export MOZILLA_HOME="/usr/local/netscape"</literal>" under  <command>bash</command> or add it to one your personal or system  initialization files. Refer to the manual page for your shell for details.  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>If you have a brand-new version of Netscape, try a previous version, in case the run-time libraries are slightly  incompatible.

<question id='ftp-wont-login'><para>Why Won't My FTP or Telnet Server Allow Logins?</para></question>
 <answer><para>This applies to server daemons that respond to clients, but don't allow logins. On new systems that have Pluggable  Authentication Modules installed, look for a file named,  "[ftp]," or "[telnet]," in the directory [/etc/pam/] or [/etc/pam.d/].  If the corresponding authentication file doesn't exist, the instructions for  configuring FTP and Telnet authentication and other PAM configuration, should  be in [/usr/doc/pam-<version>]. Refer also to the answer for  "<xref linkend='ftp-421-error' endterm='ftp-421-error'>."  </para>
<para>If it's an FTP server on an older system, make sure that the account exists in [/etc/passwd], especially ``<literal>anonymous</literal>.''  </para>
<para>This type of problem may also be caused a failure to resolve the host addresses properly, especially if using Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP). The simple answer to  this is to list all relevant host names and IP addresses in the  [/etc/hosts] files on each machine. ( Refer to the example  [/etc/hosts] and [/etc/resolv.conf]  files in: "<xref linkend='sendmail-pause' endterm='sendmail-pause'>.") If  the network has an internal DNS, make sure that each host can resolve network  addresses using it.  </para>
<para>If the host machine doesn't respond to FTP or Telnet clients at all, then the server daemon is not installed correctly,  or at all. Refer to the manual pages: <literal>inetd</literal> and  <literal>inetd.conf</literal> on older systems, or <literal>xinetd</literal>  and <literal>xinetd.conf</literal>, as well as <literal>ftpd</literal>, and  <literal>telnetd</literal>.  </para>

<question id='computer-has-wrong-time'><para>Why Does the Computer Have the Wrong Time?</para></question>

The ordinary system  time, shown and set by <command>date</command>, is maintained by the kernel  while Linux is running.  </para>
<para>You can display the CMOS clock time, or set either clock from the other, with [/sbin/clock]  (now called <command>hwclock</command> in many distributions). Refer to:  <literal>man 8 clock</literal> or <literal>man 8 hwclock</literal>.  </para>
<para>There are various other programs that can correct either or both clocks for system drift or transfer time across the network. Some of them may  already be installed on your system.

<para>Sometimes you have to enable caching of certain regions in your BIOS setup. Look in the CMOS setup and see if there  is an option to cache the new memory area which is currently switched off.  This is apparently most common on a '486.  </para>
<para>Sometimes the RAM  has to be in certain sockets to be cached. </para>
<para>Sometimes you have to set jumpers to enable caching. </para>
<para>Some motherboards don't cache all of the RAM if you have more RAM per amount of cache than the hardware expects. Usually a full 256K cache will solve this problem.  </para>

<question id='machine-runs-very-slowly-when'><para>Why Does the Machine Run Very Slowly with GCC / X / ...?</para></question>
 <answer><para>You may have too little real memory. If you have less RAM than all the programs you're running at once, Linux will swap to your hard disk instead and thrash horribly. The  solution in this case is to not run so many things at once or buy more  memory. You can also reclaim some memory by compiling and using a kernel with  fewer options configured. See (``<xref linkend="upgrade-recompile-kernel"  endterm="upgrade-recompile-kernel">'')  </para>
<para>You can tell how much memory and swap you're using with the free command, or by typing: </para>
<para>
 <screen> $ cat /proc/meminfo</screen>
 </para>
 <para>If your kernel is configured with a RAM disk, this is probably wasted space and will cause things to go slowly. Use LILO or rdev to tell the kernel not to allocate a  RAM disk (see the LILO documentation or type ``<literal>man rdev</literal>'').  </para>

<question id='upgraded-kernel-pcmcia-doesnt-work'><para>Why Doesn't My PCMCIA Card Work after Upgrading the Kernel?</para></question>
 <answer><para>The PCMCIA Card Services modules, which are located in [/lib/modules/]<emphasis role='bold'>version</emphasis>[/pcmcia],  where <emphasis role='bold'>version</emphasis> is the version number of the kernel, use  configuration information that is specific to that kernel image only. The  PCMCIA modules on your system will not work with a different kernel image.  You need to upgrade the PCMCIA card modules when you upgrade the kernel.  </para>
<para>When upgrading from older kernels, make sure that you have the most recent version of the run-time libraries, the modutils package, and so  on. Refer to the file [Documentation/Changes] in the  kernel source tree for details.  </para>
<para>Important: If you use the PCMCIA Card Services, do not enable the <literal>Network device  support/Pocket and portable adapters</literal> option of the kernel  configuration menu, as this conflicts with the modules in Card Services.  </para>
<para>Knowing the PCMCIA module dependencies of the old kernel is useful. You need to keep track of them. For example, if your PCMCIA card  depends on the serial port character device being installed as a module for  the old kernel, then you need to ensure that the serial module is available  for the new kernel and PCMCIA modules as well.  </para>
<para>The procedure described here is somewhat kludgey, but it is much easier than re-calculating module dependencies from scratch, and making sure the upgrade modules get  loaded so that both the non-PCMCIA and PCMCIA are happy. Recent kernel  releases contain a myriad of module options, too many to keep track of  easily. These steps use the existing module dependencies as much as possible,  instead of requiring you to calculate new ones.  </para>
<para>However, this procedure does not take into account instances where module dependencies are incompatible from one kernel version to another. In these cases, you'll need  to load the modules yourself with insmod, or adjust the module dependencies  in the [/etc/conf.modules] file. The  [Documentation/modules.txt] file in the kernel source tree  contains a good description of how to use the kernel loadable modules and the  module utilities like <command>insmod</command>, <command>modprobe</command>,  and <command>depmod</command>. [Modules.txt] also contains  a recommended procedure for determining which features to include in a  resident kernel, and which to build as modules.  </para>
<para>Essentially, you need to follow these steps when you install a new kernel. </para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Before building the new kernel, make a record with the <command>lsmod</command> command of the module dependencies that  your system currently uses. For example, part of the <command>lsmod</command>  output might look like this:  </para>
<screen>
  Module         Pages            Used by
  memory_cs      2                0
  ds             2                [memory_cs]  3
  i82365         4                2
  pcmcia_core    8                [memory_cs ds i82365] 3
  sg             1                0
  bsd_comp       1                0
  ppp            5                [bsd_comp] 0
  slhc           2                [ppp] 0
  serial         8                0
  psaux          1                0
  lp             2                0
 </screen>
 </para>
<para>This tells you for example that the [memory_cs] module needs the ds and [pcmcia_core] modules loaded first. What it doesn't say is  that, in order to avoid recalculating the module dependencies, you may also  need to have the [serial], [lp], [psaux], and other standard modules available to prevent  errors when installing the pcmcia routines at boot time with  <command>insmod</command>. A glance at the [/etc/modules]  file will tell you what modules the system currently loads, and in what  order. Save a copy of this file for future reference, until you have  successfully installed the new kernel's modules. Also save the  <command>lsmod</command> output to a file, for example, with the command:  <command>lsmod >lsmod.old-kernel.output</command>.  </para>

The old versions of these utilities  are not compatible with the replacement utilities that Card Services  installs. In case something goes awry with the installation, the old  utilities won't be overwritten, and you can revert to the older versions if  necessary. When configuring Card Services with the ``<literal>make  config</literal>'' command, make sure that the build scripts know where to  locate the kernel configuration, either by using information from the running  kernel, or telling the build process where the source tree of the new kernel  is. The ``<literal>make config</literal>'' step should complete without  errors. Installing the modules from the Card Services package places them in  the directory [/lib/modules/]<emphasis role='bold'>version</emphasis>[/pcmcia],  where <emphasis role='bold'>version</emphasis> is the version number of the new kernel.  </para>

 <answer><para>Because the current directory (i.e., ``<literal>.</literal>'') is not in the search path, for security reasons, as  well as to insure that the correct program versions are used. If an intruder  is able to write a file to a world-writable directory, like  [/tmp], presumably he or she would be able to execute it  if the directory were in the search path. The solution to this is to include  the directory in the command; e.g., ``<literal>./myprog</literal>,'' instead  of ``<literal>myprog</literal>.'' Or add the current directory to your  <literal>PATH</literal> environment variable; e.g., ``<literal>export  PATH=".:"$PATH</literal>'' using <application>bash</application>, although  this is discouraged for the reasons mentioned above.  </para>

<question id='get-dial-up-ppp-work'><para>Dial-up PPP Configuration</para></question>
 <answer><para>This information is mainly for people who do not have a wrapper utility like <command>kppp</command> or  <command>pppconfig</command>, or are not able to get those utilities to work  correctly. If you need to manually configure PPP to dial in to your ISP, you  will need the following information:  </para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The port that your modem is connected to: [/dev/ttyS0]-[/dev/ttyS3], which correspond to COM1-COM4 under MS-DOS.  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>The phone number of your ISP's data connection. </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>The user name and password that your ISP gave you. </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>The IP addresses of the primary and possibly secondary Domain Name Service that you will use when dialing in to the ISP. This assumes that you will not be  using a DNS that you installed on your system.  </para>
<para>When you have all of this information, make sure that the programs <command>pppd</command> and <command>chat</command>, at the very minimum, are installed correctly. In  most current distributions, they are installed in the  [/usr/sbin/] directory, and you will need to be logged in  as root to use them. In addition, the following programs are also useful for  configuring network connections, determining network status, and diagnosing  problems: [/sbin/ifconfig], [/sbin/route], [/bin/ping], [/usr/sbin/traceroute].  These are the basic steps that you need to follow to configure PPP. You must be logged in as  root.  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Make sure that the serial port and modem are operating correctly. Using a program like <command>minicomm</command> or <command>kermit</command>, you should be able  to send <literal>AT</literal> commands to the modem and receive the  <literal>OK</literal> string in response from the modem.  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Enter the primary and possibly secondary Domain Name Server IP addresses in the [/etc/resolv.conf] file, using dotted  quad notation, with the <literal>nameserver</literal> label. For example:  </para>
<screen> order hosts,bind
  nameserver 196.182.101.103
  nameserver 196.182.101.104 </screen>
 </para>
<para>The nameserver addresses in the example above are examples only. They don't correspond to actual network hosts.  The first line, <literal>order hosts,bind</literal>,  tells your networking software, when it resolves network domain addresses, to  first look in the [/etc/hosts file], and then use the bind  service; i.e., the DNS servers, which are specified on the lines that begin  with nameserver.  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Locate the chat script that PPP will use to dial the modem and connect to your ISP. In many systems, this is either in the [/etc/chatscripts] or  [/etc/ppp] directory, and will be called [provider] or something similar. You can store a  <literal>chat</literal> script anywhere, provided that you tell  <command>pppd</command> to use it rather than the default script. Refer to  the <command>chat</command> and <command>pppd</command> manual pages, and the  information below, for details. Here is a sample <literal>chat</literal>  script:  </para>
<screen>
 ABORT         BUSY
 ABORT         "NO CARRIER"
 ABORT         VOICE
 ABORT         "NO DIALTONE"
 ""            ATDT<your_isp's_phone_number>
 ogin          <your_user_name>
 word          <your_password>
 </screen>
 </para>
<para>This is a <command>chat</command> program for a simple, script based login. The <command>chat</command> program uses the pair of strings on each line as a  match/response pair. When it starts, it sends the string  ``ATDT<emphasis role='bold'>your_isp's_phone_number</emphasis>,'' where you have  substituted the actual phone number of course. It then waits for the string  <literal>ogin</literal> (a substring of the word <literal>login</literal>)  and sends your user name. It then waits for <literal>word</literal> (a  substring of <literal>password</literal>) and sends your password. If your  ISP uses a different login and password prompts, and any additional prompts,  you will need to edit the script accordingly. Again, refer to the  <command>chat</command> manual page for details.  </para>
<para>If your ISP uses PAP or CHAP authentication, you will need to edit the [pap-secrets] or [chap-secrets] files  in [/etc/ppp] directory as well. Refer to the manual pages  for these files, as well as the instruction in the files themselves.  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>The configuration of <command>pppd</command>, the program that maintains the actual connection, is usually contained in two or three separate files. The first is usually  [/etc/ppp/options], which contains options that all of  your system's PPP connections will use. (Yes, you can have more than one; as  many as your computer has serial ports, generally.)  </para>
<para>Here is a sample [/etc/ppp/options] file: </para>
<screen> #/etc/ppp/options
  asyncmap
  0
  auth
  crtscts
  lock
  noipx
  # ---<End of File>--- </screen>
 </para>
<para>The options may be given on one line or each on a separate line. Many options files are much longer, and come  with a description of each option. Here, the options mean, in order, don't  remap any characters between the PPP client and server; always use password,  PAP, or CHAP authentication when making a connection; use the modem's  hardware handshake lines for flow control; lock the serial port when in use  so no other programs can access it; and do not use the IPX network protocol.  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>For connection set-up on each individual serial port or PPP host, there will either be an  [/etc/ppp/options.ttyS1], for example, options file for  [/etc/ttyS1], or a file for your ISP in the  [/etc/ppp/peers] directory. The default is often called  [/etc/ppp/peers/provider]. Here is a sample of the default  [provider] file:  </para>
<screen> noauth
  connect "/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/chatscripts/provider"
  defaultroute
  /dev/ttyS1
  38400
  persist
 </screen>
 </para>
<para>There might be an explanation of these and other options in the [/etc/ppp/peers/provider] file  itself. You can also refer to the <command>pppd</command> manual page for  details. Briefly, they mean: do not use PAP authentication for this  connection; use the <command>chat</command> program and the  [/etc/chatscripts/provider] script, which is described  above, to dial the phone and log in; set the network default route to the PPP  connection (so when your network software needs to resolve an network address  that is not on your local machine(s), it will use the PPP connection to the  Internet); use [/dev/ttyS1] as the serial port for the  connection; set the modem speed to 38400; and keep the  <command>pppd</command> daemon running even if the connection fails.  </para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
 <para>That is all of the configuration you need. To actually start and stop PPP, there are often  [/usr/bin/pon] and [/usr/bin/poff]  scripts (in Debian), or something similar, and they are usually very simple,  and only contain the command:  </para>
<para>
 <screen> $ /usr/sbin/pppd call ${1:-provider} </screen>
 </para>
 <para>This will start <command>pppd</command> and use the <literal>call</literal> option to call the server that you type on the command line, or the provider given in the  [/etc/ppp/peers/provider] file if you do not specify a  remote server. After making the call and logging in (about 30 seconds), you  should be able to use the [/sbin/ifconfig] program to  determine that the connection really did establish a PPP interface (the first  will be [ppp0], the second will be  [ppp1], etc., depending on how many simultaneous PPP  connections you have. If something goes wrong, you can look at the  [/var/log/ppp.log] file to determine what happened. You  can also view the log as the connection is being made, by ``tailing'' it in  another window; that is, viewing it as pppd logs the connection's status  information. To do this, use the command (again, as root):  </para>
<screen> $ tail -f /var/log/ppp.log </screen>
 </para>
<para>On some systems the PPP output is directed to [/var/log/messages], in which case your system may not have a dedicated PPP log file.  </para>
<para>You should be also able to <command>ping</command> one of your ISP's domain names (e.g., <literal>mail.isp.com</literal>) and receive a response.  </para>
<para>These are the most basic steps for configuring a PPP connection. You will also need to take into account what other network connections may be present (for  example, if there's an Ethernet connection that has already been assigned the  default route), as well as various security measures at your ISP's end. If  you're having trouble making the dial-up connection, usually the best way to  determine what may be going wrong is to use Seyon, minicomm, kermit, or some  other program to dial and log in manually to the ISP, and determine just  exactly what you have to do to log in, then duplicate that in the PPP  scripts. </para> <para> Most Linux documentation also has additional  instructions for configuring PPP connections.

 <answer><para>See the <citetitle>ELF HOWTO</citetitle> by Daniel Barlow. Note that this is not the file [move-to-elf],  which is a blow-by-blow account of how to upgrade to ELF manually.  </para>
<para>Linux has two different formats for executables, object files, and object code libraries, known as, ``ELF.'' (The old format is called  ``a.out.'') They have advantages, including better support for shared  libraries and dynamic linking.  </para>
<para>Both a.out and ELF binaries can  coexist on a system. However, they use different shared C libraries, both of  which have to be installed.  </para>
<para>If you want to find out whether your system can run ELF binaries, look in [/lib] for a file named, ``[libc.so.5].'' If it's there, you probably  have ELF libraries. If you want to know whether your installation actually is  ELF you can pick a representative program, like <command>ls</command>, and  run file on it:  </para>
<para>
 <screen> -chiark:~> file /bin/ls
  /bin/ls: Linux/i386 impure executable (OMAGIC) - stripped
 
  valour:~> file /bin/ls
  /bin/ls: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1, stripped </screen>
 </para>
 <para>There is a patch to get 1.2.x to compile using the ELF compilers, and produce ELF core dumps, at <filename>ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/packages/GCC/</filename>. You do not  need the patch merely to run ELF binaries. 1.3.x and later do not need the  patch at all.  </para>
<para>The GNU glibc2 libraries are essentially more recent versions of ELF libraries that follow most of the same processes for  dynamic linking and loading. Upgrade information is contained in (``<xref  linkend="upgrade-libraries-withough-trashing"  endterm="upgrade-libraries-withough-trashing">'')  </para>

 <answer><para><literal>.gz</literal> (and <literal>.z</literal>) files are compressed using GNU <command>gzip</command>. You need to use <command>gunzip</command> (which is  a symlink to the <command>gzip</command> command that comes with most Linux  installations) to unpack the file.  </para>
<para><literal>.taz</literal>, <literal>.tar.Z</literal>, and <literal>.tz</literal> are <emphasis role='bold'>tar</emphasis> files (made with <command>tar</command>) and  compressed using <command>compress</command>. The standard *nix  <command>compress</command> is proprietary software, but free equivalents  like ncompress exist.  </para>
<para><literal>.tgz</literal> (or <literal>.tpz</literal>) is a tar file compressed with <command>gzip</command>.  </para>
<para><literal>.bz2</literal> is a file compressed by the more recently introduced (and efficient) <command>bzip2</command>.  </para>
<para><literal>.lsm</literal> is a <citetitle>Linux Software Map</citetitle> entry, in the form of a short text file. Details about the LSM project and the LSM itself are available in the  subdirectory on <filename>ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/</filename>.  </para>
<para><literal>.deb</literal> is a Debian Binary Package - the binary package format used by the Debian GNU/Linux distribution. It is manipulated using  <command>dpkg</command> and <command>dpkg-deb</command> (available on Debian  systems and from <filename>ftp://ftp.debian.org/</filename>).  </para>
<para><literal>.rpm</literal> is a Red Hat RPM package, which is used in the Red Hat and similar distributions.  </para>
<para><literal>.sit</literal> is a compressed Macintosh archive made with StuffIt, a commercial program. Aladdin Systems Inc., the manufacturer of StuffIt, has a free expander utility that  will uncompress these archives. You can download it at  <ulink url='http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/'><citetitle>http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/</citetitle></ulink>.  </para>
<para>The <command>file</command> command can often tell you what a file is. </para>
<para>If you find that <command>gzip</command> complains when you try to uncompress a file, you probably downloaded it in ASCII mode by  mistake. You must download most things in binary mode:  ``<literal>get</literal>,'' to download the file.  </para>

<question><para><emphasis role='bold'>programname: </emphasis> <literal>error in loading shared libraries: lib</literal> <emphasis role='bold'>xxx.</emphasis><literal>.so.</literal></para></question>
 <para><emphasis role='bold'>x</emphasis><literal>: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.</literal>  </para>
<answer><para>A message like this, when the program that you're trying to run uses shared libraries, usually means one of two  things: the program was either compiled on a machine that had a different set  of libraries or library paths than yours; or you've upgraded your libraries  but not the program.  </para>
<para>Executable programs that are linked with dynamic libraries, expect the full pathname of each of the library files it  requires. So do the shared libraries, if they rely on other libraries. This  is so the shared object dependencies remain as unambiguous as possible, and  also as a security measure.  </para>
<para>Short of recompiling the executable file for the libraries on the systemprobably the most desirable alternative in the long run - you can try to determine which libraries the  executable file needs with the command: ``<literal>ldd  </literal><emphasis role='bold'>programname</emphasis>.'' The output will be a list of  the shared libraries on the system that the program needs to run, as well as  the missing libraries. You can then add the library packages, or if the  libraries already exist in a different directory, you can create a symbolic  link so the program can find it. For example, if the program requires  /usr/lib/libncurses.so.2, and your machine has /lib/libncurses.so.2, you can  create a link where the program expects to find the library; e.g.:  </para>
<para>
 <screen> # cd /usr/lib &amp;&amp; ln -s /lib/libncurses.so.2 . </screen>
 </para>
 <para>You should note, however, that creating library links like these should be considered a security risk, and the additional links you  create will not be compatible with future upgrades. It's simply a quick fix  for backward compatibility.  </para>
<para>Also, it may take some guesswork to determine in exactly which of the system library directories the program  expects to find a shared library file, because <literal>ldd</literal> will  not list the paths of libraries it can't find. A program most likely will  tell the run-time linker, <literal>/lib/ld.so</literal>, to look for shared  libraries in [/lib], [/usr/lib], [/usr/local/lib], or [/usr/X11R6/lib],  if it's an X client. But that doesn't mean that libraries can't be installed  elsewhere. It helps to have some idea of the original library configuration  before proceeding.  </para>
<para>Also be sure to run <literal>ldconfig</literal> after creating the symbolic link, so that <literal>ld.so</literal> has an updated view of the system's libraries. You  should also make certain that all of the library directories are listed in  [/etc/ld.so.conf], and perhaps in the  <literal>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</literal> environment variable.  </para>

<para>Id ``x'' is the number in the leftmost column of the [/etc/inittab] file:  </para>

 5:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty5
 6:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty6

 </para>
 <para>Commenting the offending line out and then fixing the errant program and testing on the command line will allow you to see any  error messages that go to standard error output (console) if the errors are  not going to the system log file.

<para>First and foremost, make certain that you have provided, as closely as possible, the correct information to the installation program of your video hardware: the  video card and monitor. Some installation programs can correctly guess a  ``least common denominator'' screen configuration, like a 640-by-480  VESA-standard display, but there are many possible video hardware  configurations that may not be able to display this standard.  </para>
<para>The X Window System configuration file is called (usually) [/etc/XF86Config], [/etc/X11/XF86Config], or  [/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config].  </para>
<para>If you need to manually configure the X server, there are several possible methods: </para>

If you log in as the superuser, you should be able to use <literal>X  --probeonly</literal> to get a listing of the video card chipset, memory, and  any special graphics features. Also, refer to the manual page for the X  server. (E.g.; <literal>man X</literal>), and try running the X server and  redirecting the standard error output to a file so you can determine, after  you can view text on the screen again, what error messages the server is  generating; e.g., <literal>X 2>x.error</literal>.  </para>
</listitem>

<question id='what-in-request-help'><para>What to Put in a Request for Help</para></question>
 <answer><para>Please read the following advice carefully about how to write your posting or E-mail. Making a complete posting will greatly increase the  chances that an expert or fellow user reading it will have enough  information and motivation to reply.  </para>
<para>This advice applies both to postings asking for advice and to personal E-mail sent to experts and fellow users.  </para>
<para>Make sure you give full details of the problem, including: </para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>What program, exactly, you are having problems with. Include the version number if known and say where you got it. Many standard  commands tell you their version number if you give them a  <literal>--version</literal> option.  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Which Linux release you're using (Red Hat, Slackware, Debian, or whatever) and what version of that release.  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>The exact and complete text of any error messages printed. </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Exactly what behavior you expected, and exactly what behavior you observed. A transcript of an example session is a good way to show  this.  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>The contents of any configuration files used by the program in question and any related programs.  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>What version of the kernel and shared libraries you have installed. The kernel version can be found by typing  ``<literal>uname -a</literal>,'' and  the shared library version by typing  ``<literal>ls -l /lib/libc*</literal>.''  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Details of what hardware you're running on, if it seems appropriate.  </para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
 <para>You are in little danger of making your posting too long unless you include large chunks of source code or uuencoded files, so err on the  side of giving too much information.  </para>
<para>Use a clear, detailed Subject line. Don't put things like ``doesn't work,'' ``Linux,'' ``help,'' or ``question'' in itwe already know that.  Save the space for the name of the program, a fragment of an error  message, or summary of the unusual behavior.  </para>
<para>Put a summary paragraph at the top of your posting. </para>
<para>At the bottom of your posting, ask for responses by email and say you'll post a summary. Back this up by using  ``<literal>Followup-To: poster</literal>.''  Then, actually post the summary in a few days or a week or so. Don't  just concatenate the replies you gotsummarize. Putting the word  ``SUMMARY'' in your summary's Subject line is also a good idea. Consider  submitting the summary to <citetitle>comp.os.linux.announce</citetitle>.  </para>
<para>Make sure your posting doesn't have an inappropriate References: header line. This marks your article as part of the thread of the  article referred to, which will often cause it to be junked by  readers, along with the rest of a boring thread.  </para>
<para>You might like to say in your posting that you've read this FAQ and the appropriate HOWTO'sthis may make people less likely to skip your  posting.  </para>
<para>Remember that you should not post E-mail sent to you personally without the sender's permission.  </para>

<question id='mail-someone-about-problem'><para>How To Email Someone about Your Problem</para></question>
 <answer><para>Try to find the author or developer of whatever program or component is causing you difficulty. If you have a contact point for your Linux  distribution, you should use it.  </para>
<para>Please put everything in your E-mail message that you would put in a posting asking for help.  </para>
<para>Finally, remember that, despite the fact that most of the Linux community are very helpful and responsive to E-mailed questions,  you're likely asking for help from unpaid volunteers, so you have no  right to expect an answer.  </para>
