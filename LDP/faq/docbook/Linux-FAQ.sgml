<para>
This is the list of Frequently Asked Questions for Linux, the free
operating system kernel that runs on many modern computer systems.
The kernel source code documentation says that Linux ``aims for POSIX
compliance.''  Linux uses mostly free, GNU system utilities and
application software, although commercial programs are available also.
Originally written for 386/486/586 Intel/ISA bus machines, Linux
versions exist for nearly every hardware platform in existence that is
capable of running it.  (Please refer to the question, ``<xref
linkend="what-is-linux" endterm="what-is-linux">'' below.)  This FAQ
is meant to be read in conjunction with the Linux Documentation
Project's HOWTO series.  (``<xref linkend="get-linux-material-by-ftp"
endterm="get-linux-material-by-ftp">'' and, ``<xref
linkend="howtos-and-other-documentation"
endterm="howtos-and-other-documentation">'') The
<citetitle>INFO-SHEET</citetitle> and <citetitle>META-FAQ</citetitle>
also list sources of Linux information.  Please read them, and,
``<xref linkend="still-havent-answered"
endterm="still-havent-answered">'' before posting to a Usenet news
group.  You can also get Postscript, HTML, and SGML versions of this

<para>
Linux is the kernel of operating systems that look like and perform as
well or better than the famous operating system from AT&amp;T Bell
Labs.  Linus Torvalds and a loosely knit team of volunteer hackers
from across the Internet wrote (and still are writing) Linux from
scratch.  It has all of the features of a modern, fully fledged
operating system: true multitasking, threads, virtual memory, shared
libraries, demand loading, shared, copy-on-write executables, proper
memory management, loadable device driver modules, video frame
buffering, and TCP/IP networking.
</para>
<para>
Most people, however, refer to the operating system kernel, system
software, and application software, collectively, as ``Linux,'' and
that convention is used in this FAQ as well.
</para>
<para>
Linux was written originally for 386/486/586-based PC's, using the
hardware facilities of the 80386 processor family to implement its
features. There are now many ports to other hardware platforms.
(``<xref linkend="what-ports-to-other-processors-are-there"

There are also Linux distributions specifically for mobile and
handheld platforms.  An API specification and developers kit for the
Crusoe Smart Microprocessor developed by Transmeta Corporation are at

Some distributions can still be installed via anonymous FTP from
various Linux archive sites, but in many cases, the size of the
distribution makes this impractical.  (``<xref

many new announcements of free software first appear.  Freshmeat is
basically a site index that continuously updates the notices of new or
upgraded software for Linux, and maintains indexes of the announcements
and links to their URL's.

<para>
The FTP sites (``<xref linkend="get-linux-material-by-ftp"
endterm="get-linux-material-by-ftp">'') often have
<filename>ls-lR</filename> or <filename>INDEX</filename> directory
listings which you can search using <command>grep</command> or a text
editor.  The directory listings files can be very large, however, making
them unwieldy for quick searches.

If it's a large package that may require some porting, post
a message to <citetitle>comp.os.linux.development.apps</citetitle>.
</para>
<para>
If you compile a large-ish program, please upload it to one or more of

You can fit an installation that includes X into 80Mb. Installing
Debian GNU/Linux takes 500Mb&ndash;1GB, including kernel source code, some
space for user files, and spool areas.

How Much Memory Does Linux Need?</title>
<para>
At least 4MB, and then you will need to use special installation
procedures until the disk swap space is installed. Linux will run
comfortably in 4MB of RAM, although running GUI apps is impractically
slow because they need to swap out to disk.

</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
The parameter ``<emphasis>XX</emphasis>M'' is the amount of memory,
specified as megabytes; for example, ``128M.'' 
</para>
<para>
If an ``<literal>append=</literal>'' directive with other
configuration options already exists in
<filename>/etc/lilo.conf</filename>, then add the
<literal>mem=</literal> directive to the end of the existing

Be sure to run the ``<command>lilo</command>'' command to install the
new configuration.

Should I Upgrade to the 2.4.0 Kernel?  Now?
</title>
<para>
``It's ready.''  
</para>
<para>
With those two resounding, immortal words, which rank with ``Nuts!''
and ``Damn the torpedoes!'' in the domain of histrionics, Linus
Torvalds released brand-new kernel version 2.4.0, product of countless
hours of coding, testing, and re-coding, by dogged kernel hackers, to
the public.
</para>
<para>
Among the new kernel's features are: support for the IBM S/390, the
Logical Volume Manager, NFS Version 3 servers, PCMCIA CardBus devices,
USB peripherals, the Device File System, 64 GB of RAM (yes, that's
memory, not disk space), Itanium and MMX processors, drivers for many
additional hardware devices, greater maximum file sizes, and vastly
improved Symmetric Multiprocessing capabilities.
</para>
<para>
The changes are more significant for non-i386 platforms, although
developers on i386 platforms can make use of the improvements&mdash;
and stumble over the incompatibilities&mdash;of the new kernel as well.
</para>
<para>
If there's a compelling reason to upgrade, the source code is
available, in the tar archive:
<filename>linux-2.4.0.tar.gz</filename>, in all of the usual
places.  (Refer to: ``<xref
linkend="where-can-i-get-the-latest-kernel-version"
endterm="where-can-i-get-the-latest-kernel-version">,'' below.)  It
will likely be several months at least before the commercial vendors
upgrade their distributions to the new kernel.

<title id="kgcc">
Should I Use the Red Hat 7.0 <literal>kgcc</literal> Compiler?
</title>
<para>
Red Hat Linux 7.0 ships with two compilers, GCC 2.96, and KGCC, a.k.a,
EGCS 1.1.2, a.k.a GCC 2.91.66.  Confusing?  You bet it is.  It's
probably better to use one of the standard GCC releases.  The Free
Software Foundation says that GCC 2.96, contains extensions that
produce object code which is not compatible with previous versions of
GCC, in addition to the normal bugs found in development software.
The FSF changed the version number of their current development
compiler to 2.97 to distinguish them.  The FSF's statement is at
<ulink url="http://www.fsf.org/software/gcc/gcc-2.96.html">
<literal>http://www.fsf.org/software/gcc/gcc-2.96.html</literal>
</ulink>.
</para>
<para>
You can determine the compiler version numbers by typing ``<literal>gcc
--version</literal>'' and ``<literal>kgcc --version</literal>.''  The
latest stable GCC release is 2.95.2.
</para>
<para>
Any recent, officially released GNU C compiler from versions 2.7.2
onward should compile the generic kernel source code, unless it's the
Version 2.4 kernel, in which case you'll need GCC 2.91.66 (EGCS
1.1.2).  Don't expect any support from the kernel developers if you're
using an earlier compiler.  
</para>

<citetitle>Comp.os.linux.announce</citetitle> is the moderated
announcements group.  You should read this if you intend to use Linux.
It contains information about software updates, new ports, user group
meetings, and commercial products. It is the <emphasis>only</emphasis>

Remember that Linux is POSIX compatible, and most all of the material
in the <citetitle>comp.unix.*</citetitle> and 
<citetitle>comp.windows.x.*</citetitle> groups will be relevant. Apart
from hardware considerations, and some obscure or very technical
low-level issues, you'll find that these groups are good places to
start.

Please read

<title>Compatibility with Other Operating Systems</title>
<sect2 label="4.1">
<title id="can-linux-share-my-disk-with-dos">
Can Linux Share My Disk with DOS? OS/2? 386BSD? Win95?</title>
<para>
Yes. Linux uses the standard MS-DOS partitioning scheme, so it can
share your disk with other operating systems. 
</para>
<para>
Linux has loadable kernel modules for (presumably) all versions of
Microsoft FAT and VFAT file systems, including Windows 2000 and 
WindowsMe.  In a correctly configured system, they should load 
automatically when the partitions are mounted.
</para>
<para>
Note, however, that many other operating systems may not be exactly
compatible. DOS's <filename>FDISK.EXE</filename> and
<filename>FORMAT.EXE</filename>, for example, can overwrite data in a
Linux partition, because they sometimes incorrectly use partition data
from the partition's boot sector rather than the partition table.
</para>
<para>
In order to prevent programs from doing this, it is a good idea to
zero out&mdash;under Linux&mdash;the start of a partition you created, before
you use MS-DOS&mdash;or whatever&mdash;to format it. Type:
</para>
<para>
<screen>
   $ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdXY bs=512 count=1
</screen>
</para>
<para>
where <emphasis>hdXY</emphasis> is the relevant partition; e.g.,
<filename>/dev/hda1</filename> for the first partition of the first
(IDE) disk.
</para>
<para>
Linux can read and write the files on your DOS and OS/2 FAT partitions
and floppies using either the DOS file system type built into the
kernel or mtools. There is kernel support for the VFAT file system
used by Windows 9x and Windows NT.
</para>

There is reportedly a GPL'd OS/2 device driver that will read and

How Can I Boot Linux from MS-DOS?</title>
<para>
If LILO doesn't work, and if the machine has MS-DOS or Microsoft
Windows, you may be left with a computer that won't boot. This can
also happen on an upgrade to your Linux distribution. Re-installing
LILO is the last thing that the installation does. So it is vitally
important when installing or upgrading Linux on a dual boot machine,
to have a MS-DOS or Windows rescue disk nearby so you can
<literal>FDISK -MBR</literal>.  Then you can go about using
<filename>LOADLIN.EXE</filename> instead of LILO.

How Can I Get Linux to Work with My Disk?</title>

If your disk is an IDE or EIDE drive, you should read the file
<filename>/usr/src/linux/drivers/block/README.ide</filename>

source code). This <filename>README</filename> contains many 
helpful hints about IDE
drives. Many modern IDE controllers do translation between `physical'
cylinders/heads/sectors, and `logical' ones.
</para>
<para>
SCSI disks are accessed by linear block numbers. The BIOS invents some
`logical' cylinder/head/sector fiction to support DOS.
</para>
<para>
An IBM PC-compatible BIOS will usually not be able to access
partitions which extend beyond 1024 logical cylinders, and will make
booting a Linux kernel from such partitions using LILO problematic at
best.
</para>
<para>
You can still use such partitions for Linux or other operating systems
that access the controller directly.
</para>
<para>
It's recommend that you create at least one Linux partition entirely
under the 1024 logical cylinder limit, and boot from that. The other
partitions will then be okay.

How Do I Add Temporary Swap Space?</title>
<para>
In addition to a swap partition, Linux can also use a swap file. Some
programs, like <application>g++</application>, can use huge amounts of 
virtual memory, requiring
the temporary creation of extra space. To install an extra 64 MB of
swap space, for example, use the following shell commands:
</para>
<para><screen>
   # dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap bs=1024 count=65535
   # mkswap /swap
   # swapon /swap
</screen></para>
<para>
The <command>count=</command> argument to <command>dd</command> 
determines how big the swap file will be. In
this example the swap file's name is <filename>/swap</filename>, 
but the name and
location are, generally, arbitrary, depending only on the file
system's available space and your having write permissions in the
directory.

When you don't need the swap space any more, remove it with the
following statements:

How Do I Port <emphasis>XXX</emphasis> to Linux?</title>
<para>
In general, *nix programs need very little porting. Simply follow the
installation instructions. If you don't know&mdash;and don't know how to
find out&mdash;the answers to some of the questions asked during the
installation procedure, you can guess, but this tends to produce buggy
programs. In this case, you're probably better off asking someone else
to do the port.

If you have a BSD-ish program, you should try using 
<command>-I/usr/include/bsd</command>
and <command>-lbsd</command> on the appropriate parts 
of the compilation lines.

What Is <application>ld.so</application> and Where Do I Get It?</title>
<para>
<application>ld.so</application> is the dynamic library loader. 
Each binary using shared
libraries used to have about 3K of start-up code to find and load the
shared libraries. Now that code has been put in a special shared
library, <filename>/lib/ld.so</filename>, where all binaries

wastes less disk space, and can be upgraded more easily.

How Do I Upgrade the Libraries without Trashing My System?</title>
<warning><para>
Note: You should always have a rescue disk set ready when you perform
this procedure, in the likely event that something goes wrong!
</para></warning>
<para>
This procedure is especially difficult if you're upgrading very old
libraries like <application>libc4</application>. But you should be 
able to keep <application>libc4</application> on the same
system with <application>libc5</application> libraries for the 
programs that still need them. The
same holds true for upgrading from <application>libc5</application> to 
the newer-yet <application>glibc2</application> libraries.
</para>
<para>
The problem with upgrading dynamic libraries is that, the moment you
remove the old libraries, the utilities that you need to upgrade to
the new version of the libraries don't work. There are ways around
around this. One is to temporarily place a spare copy of the run time
libraries, which are in <filename>/lib/</filename>, in 
<filename>/usr/lib/</filename>, or <filename>/usr/local/lib/</filename>, 
or another directory that is listed in the 
<filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename> file.
</para>
<para>
For example, when upgrading <application>libc5</application> libraries, 
the files in <filename>/lib/</filename> might
look something like:
</para>
<para><screen>
   libc.so.5
   libc.so.5.4.33
   libm.so.5
   libm.so.5.0.9
</screen></para>
<para>
These are the C libraries and the math libraries. Copy them to another
directory that is listed in <filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename>, 
like <filename>/usr/lib/</filename>:
</para>
<para><screen>
   $ cp -df /lib/libc.so.5* /usr/lib/
   $ cp -df /lib/libm.so.5* /usr/lib/
   $ ldconfig
</screen></para>
<para>
Be sure to run <command>ldconfig</command> 
to upgrade the library configuration.
</para>
<para>
The files <filename>libc.so.5</filename> and <filename>libm.so.5</filename>
are symbolic links to the actual
library files. When you upgrade, the new links will not be created if
the old links are still there, unless you use the <command>-f</command>
flag with <command>cp</command>. The
<command>-d</command> flag to <command>cp</command> will copy the 
symbolic link itself, and not the file it points to.
</para>
<para>
If you need to overwrite the link to the library directly, use the 
<command>-f</command> flag with <command>ln</command>.
</para>
<para>
For example, to copy new libraries over the old ones, try this. Make a
symbolic link to the new libraries first, then copy both the libraries
and the links to <filename>/lib/</filename>, with the following commands.
</para>
<para><screen>
   $ ln -sf ./libm.so.5.0.48 libm.so.5
   $ ln -sf ./libc.so.5.0.48 libc.so.5
   $ cp -df libm.so.5* /lib
   $ cp -df libc.so.5* /lib
</screen></para>
<para>
Again, remember to run <command>ldconfig</command> after you copy 
the libraries.
</para>
<para>
If you are satisfied that everything is working correctly, you can
remove the temporary copies of the old libraries from 
<filename>/usr/lib/</filename> or wherever you copied them.

Can I Use Code or a Compiler Compiled for a 486 on My 386?</title>

Yes, unless it's the kernel.
</para>
<para>
The <command>-m486</command> option to <application>GCC</application>, 
which is used to compile binaries for x486
machines, merely changes certain optimizations. This makes for
slightly larger binaries that run somewhat faster on a 486. They still
work fine on a 386, though, with a small performance hit.
</para>
<para>
However, from version 1.3.35 the kernel uses 486 or Pentium-specific
instructions if configured for a 486 or Pentium, thus making it
unusable on a 386.
</para>
<para>
<application>GCC</application> can be configured for a 386 or 
486; the only difference is that
configuring it for a 386 makes <command>-m386</command> the default 
and configuring for a
486 makes <command>-m486</command> the default. In either case, 
these can be overridden
on a per-compilation basis or by editing
<filename>/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i*-linux/</filename>
<emphasis>n.n.n</emphasis><filename>/specs</filename>.
</para>
<para>
There is an alpha version of <application>GCC</application> that knows
how to do optimization well for the 586, but it is quite unreliable,
especially at high optimization settings. The Pentium GCC can be found
on <ulink url="ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/ALPHA/pentium-gcc/">
<literal>ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/ALPHA/pentium-gcc/</literal>

smaller.

With an <acronym>ELF</acronym> compiler

common cause of large executables is the lack of an appropriate .so

linked&mdash;one which includes a copy of the C library instead of a
dynamically linked copy.

Other things worth investigating are <command>-O</command> and

I Upgraded the Kernel and Now My PCMCIA Card Doesn't Work.</title>

The PCMCIA Card Services modules, which are located in
<filename>/lib/modules/</filename><emphasis>version</emphasis><filename>/pcmcia</filename>,
where <emphasis>version</emphasis> is the version number of the
kernel, use configuration information that is specific to that kernel
image only. The PCMCIA modules on your system will not work with a
different kernel image. You need to upgrade the PCMCIA card modules
when you upgrade the kernel.
</para>
<para>
When upgrading from older kernels, make sure that you have the most recent
version of the run-time libraries, the modutils package, and so on.
Refer to the file <filename>Documentation/Changes</filename> 
in the kernel source tree for details.
</para>
<para>
Important: If you use the PCMCIA Card Services, do not enable the
<literal>Network device support/Pocket and portable adapters</literal>
option of the kernel configuration menu, as this conflicts with the
modules in Card Services.
</para>
<para>
Knowing the PCMCIA module dependencies of the old kernel is useful.
You need to keep track of them. For example, if your PCMCIA card
depends on the serial port character device being installed as a
module for the old kernel, then you need to ensure that the serial
module is available for the new kernel and PCMCIA modules as well.
</para>
<para>
The procedure described here is somewhat kludgey, but it is much easier
than re-calculating module dependencies from scratch, and making sure
the upgrade modules get loaded so that both the non-PCMCIA and PCMCIA
are happy. Recent kernel releases contain a myriad of module options,
too many to keep track of easily. These steps use the existing module
dependencies as much as possible, instead of requiring you to
calculate new ones.
</para>
<para>
However, this procedure does not take into account instances where
module dependencies are incompatible from one kernel version to
another. In these cases, you'll need to load the modules yourself with
insmod, or adjust the module dependencies in the
<filename>/etc/conf.modules</filename> file. The
<filename>Documentation/modules.txt</filename> file in the kernel
source tree contains a good description of how to use the kernel
loadable modules and the module utilities like
<command>insmod</command>, <command>modprobe</command>, and
<command>depmod</command>.  <filename>Modules.txt</filename> also
contains a recommended procedure for determining which features to
include in a resident kernel, and which to build as modules.

Essentially, you need to follow these steps when you install a new
kernel.
</para>

How Do I Install Linux Using FTP?</title>
<para>
Installing a major distribution can be impractical because of the size
of the distribution and interdependence of many of the software
packages. Installing a basic Linux system that doesn't have a GUI or
the major applications, is possible with FTP, however. The main
non-commercial distribution in use is Debian GNU/Linux, and this
answer describes an installation of the basic Debian system, to which
you can add other Linux applications and commercial software as
necessary.
</para>

You will need a system with at least a 80386 processor, 8 Mb of
memory, and about 100 Mb of disk space. More memory and a larger disk
is necessary however, for practical everyday use.

<para>
This is a <command>chat</command>

program uses the pair of strings on each line as a match/response
pair. When it starts, it sends the string
``ATDT<emphasis>your_isp's_phone_number</emphasis>,''

<para>
The options may be given on one line or each on a separate line.
Many options files are much longer, and come with a description of
each option. Here, the options mean, in order, don't remap any
characters between the PPP client and server; always use password,
PAP, or CHAP authentication when making a connection; use the
modem's hardware handshake lines for flow control; lock the serial
port when in use so no other programs can access it; and do not
use the IPX network protocol.
</para></listitem>

For connection set-up on each individual serial port or PPP host,
there will either be an <filename>/etc/ppp/options.ttyS1</filename>,

options file for <filename>/etc/ttyS1</filename>, or a file for 
your ISP in the <filename>/etc/ppp/peers</filename> directory.

<para>
There might be an explanation of these and other options in the
<filename>/etc/ppp/peers/provider</filename> file itself. You 
can also refer to the
<command>pppd</command> manual page for details. 
Briefly, they mean: do not use PAP
authentication for this connection; use the <command>chat</command> 
program and the
<filename>/etc/chatscripts/provider</filename> script, which is 
described above, to
dial the phone and log in; set the network default route to the
PPP connection (so when your network software needs to resolve an
network address that is not on your local machine(s), it will use
the PPP connection to the Internet); use <filename>/dev/ttyS1</filename> 
as the serial
port for the connection; set the modem speed to 38400; and keep
the <command>pppd</command> daemon running even if the connection fails.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
That is all of the configuration you need. To actually start and
stop PPP, there are often <filename>/usr/bin/pon</filename> and 
<filename>/usr/bin/poff</filename> scripts
(in Debian), or something similar, and they are usually very simple,
and only contain the command:
</para>
<para><screen>
   $ /usr/sbin/pppd call ${1:-provider}
</screen></para>
<para>
This will start <command>pppd</command> and use the 
<literal>call</literal> option to call the
server that you type on the command line, or the provider given in
the <filename>/etc/ppp/peers/provider</filename> file if you 
do not specify a remote
server. After making the call and logging in (about 30 seconds),
you should be able to use the <filename>/sbin/ifconfig</filename> 
program to determine
that the connection really did establish a PPP interface (the
first will be <filename>ppp0</filename>, the second will be 
<filename>ppp1</filename>, etc., depending on
how many simultaneous PPP connections you have. If something goes
wrong, you can look at the <filename>/var/log/ppp.log</filename> 
file to determine what
happened. You can also view the log as the connection is being
made, by ``tailing'' it in another window; that is, viewing it as
pppd logs the connection's status information. To do this, use the
command (again, as root):
</para>
<para><screen>
   $ tail -f /var/log/ppp.log
</screen></para>
<para>
On some systems the PPP output is directed to 
<filename>/var/log/messages</filename>, in which case your system
may not have a dedicated PPP log file.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>    
<para>
You should be also able to <command>ping</command> 
one of your ISP's domain names
(e.g., <literal>mail.isp.com</literal>) and receive a response.
</para>
<para>
These are the most basic steps for configuring a PPP connection. You
will also need to take into account what other network connections may
be present (for example, if there's an Ethernet connection that has
already been assigned the default route), as well as various security
measures at your ISP's end. If you're having trouble making the
dial-up connection, usually the best way to determine what may be
going wrong is to use Seyon, minicomm, kermit, or some other program to dial
and log in manually to the ISP, and determine just exactly what you
have to do to log in, then duplicate that in the PPP scripts.

What Is a ``<filename>core</filename>'' File?
</title>
<para>
A <literal>core</literal> file is created when a program terminates
unexpectedly, due to a bug, or a violation of the operating system's
or hardware's protection mechanisms.  The operating system kills the
program and creates a <filename>core</filename> file that programmers
can use to figure out what went wrong. It contains a detailed
description of the state that the program was in when it died.
</para>
<para>
If would like to determine what program a core file came from, use the
<literal>file</literal> command, like this:
</para>
<para>
<screen>
   $ file core

How Do I Configure Emacs to Start with My Default Settings?</title>
<para>
Create a file in your home directory named 
<filename>.emacs</filename> with the Emacs Lisp
commands that you want to run every time Emacs starts up. You won't
see the file in the directory listing.  (The leading '.' tells 
<command>ls</command> not to
display it, unless you use the <literal>-a</literal> command 
line switch with <command>ls</command>.)
</para>
<para>
Any kind of Emacs Lisp statement will work in the 
<filename>.emacs</filename> file,
including entire <literal>defuns</literal>. 
Emacs uses lisp variables and statements extensively, and 
many of the editing functions are written in Emacs Lisp.
For example, to enable word wrapping whenever
you edit a file that ends with <filename>.txt</filename>, 
add the following statement.  This is from the Emacs 
Texinfo help document (
<keycombo><keycap>F1</keycap><keycap>i</keycap></keycombo>,
then <keycap>m</keycap> <literal>Emacs</literal> <keycap>Return</keycap>):
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>
(add-hook text-mode-hook
	'(lambda () (auto-fill-mode 1)))
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
This adds a statement that calls a <emphasis>hook</emphasis>
function whenever a text editing mode is entered for that
buffer.  The value of <literal>text-mode-hook</literal>, 
which is a variable, to <literal>auto-fill-mode</literal>,
which is a function.
</para>
<para>
If you want to turn off the menu bar at the top of each Emacs frame,
add this statement:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>
(menu-bar-mode -1)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
And if you want to include an Emacs Lisp program that someone has
written, like <filename>msb.el</filename> 
(an enhanced, pop-up buffer menu), make sure the
lisp file is in a directory where Emacs can find it (usually it will
be named Site-lisp), and add these statements in the 
<filename>.emacs</filename> file:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>
(require 'msb)
(msb-mode 1)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
Most tasks have several possible solutions in Emacs Lisp. Any task
that can be programmed in Emacs Lisp is valid in the 
<filename>.emacs</filename> file. For
more information, consult the Texinfo documentation. 
There is also a FAQ list for Emacs (refer to: What
other FAQ's are there for Linux? ).

<para>
Linux has two different formats for executables, object files, and
object code libraries, known as, ``ELF.'' (The old format is called
``a.out.'') They have advantages, including better support for shared
libraries and dynamic linking.

<para>
Both a.out and ELF binaries can coexist on a system. However, they use
different shared C libraries, both of which have to be installed.
</para>
<para>
If you want to find out whether your system can run ELF binaries, look
in <filename>/lib</filename> for a file named,
``<filename>libc.so.5</filename>.''  If it's there, you probably have
ELF libraries. If you want to know whether your installation actually
is ELF you can pick a representative program, like
<command>ls</command>, and run file on it:

How Many People Use Linux?</title>
<para>
Linux is freely available, and no one is required to register with any
central authority, so it is difficult to know. Several businesses
survive solely on selling and supporting Linux. Linux news groups are
some of the most heavily read on Usenet. Accurate numbers are hard to
come by, but the number is almost certainly in the millions.
</para>
<para>
However, people can register as Linux users at the Linux Counter
project, which has been in existence since 1993. In August, 1998, the
project counted more than 70,000 users.

The ``best'' of anything depends on your particular needs.
Discussions like these frequently occur on Usenet.  Most often they're
flame bait. Answering is generally a waste of time.  Free software
licensing is unrestrictive enough, that, with a little experience, you
can perform your own testing on your own hosts.

The difference isn't in the pronunciation of Linux but in the language
Linus uses to say, ``hello.''
</para>
<para>
For the benefit of those who don't have the equipment or inclination:
Linus pronounces Linux approximately as Leenus, where the ``ee'' is
pronounced as in ``feet,'' but rather shorter, and the ``u'' is like a
much shorter version of the French ``eu'' sound in ``peur''
(pronouncing it as the ``u'' in ``put'' is probably passable).

<para>
If the fault is repeatable (i.e., it always happens at the same place
in the same file&mdash;even after rebooting and trying again, using a
stable kernel) you have discovered a bug in GCC. See the GCC Info
documentation (type
<keycombo><keycap>F1</keycap><keycap>i</keycap></keycombo> in Emacs,
and select GCC from the menu) for details on how to report the
error.  Make sure you have the latest version, though.

Note that this is probably not a Linux-specific problem. Unless you
are compiling a program many other Linux users also compile, you
should not post your bug report to any of the comp.os.linux groups.

If this doesn't fix the problem, you are probably having problems with

refresh timing for your SIMMS and cache are correct (hardware manuals
are sometimes wrong, too). If so, you may have some marginal SIMMS, or
a faulty motherboard or hard disk or controller.

<emphasis>x</emphasis><literal>: cannot open shared object file:
No such file or directory.</literal>
</title>
<para>
A message like this, when the program that you're trying to run uses
shared libraries, usually means one of two things: the program was
either compiled on a machine that had a different set of libraries
or library paths than yours; or you've upgraded your libraries 
but not the program.  
</para>
<para>
Executable programs that are linked with dynamic libraries, expect the
full pathname of each of the library files it requires.  So do the
shared libraries, if they rely on other libraries.  This is so
the shared object dependencies remain as unambiguous as possible, and
also as a security measure.  
</para>
<para>
Short of recompiling the executable file for the libraries on the
system&mdash;probably the most desirable alternative in the long
run&mdash;you can try to determine which libraries the executable file needs
with the command: ``<literal>ldd 
</literal><emphasis>programname</emphasis>.''  The output will be a
list of the shared libraries on the system that the program needs to
run, as well as the missing libraries.  You can then add the library
packages, or if the libraries already exist in a different directory,
you can create a symbolic link so the program can find it.  For
example, if the program requires /usr/lib/libncurses.so.2, and your
machine has /lib/libncurses.so.2, you can create a link where the
program expects to find the library; e.g.:
</para>
<para>
<screen>
# cd /usr/lib && ln -s /lib/libncurses.so.2 .
</screen>
</para>
<para>
You should note, however, that creating library links like these
should be considered a security risk, and the additional links you
create will not be compatible with future upgrades.  It's simply
a quick fix for backward compatibility.
</para>
<para>
Also, it may take some guesswork to determine in exactly which of the
system library directories the program expects to find a shared
library file, because <literal>ldd</literal> will not list the paths
of libraries it can't find.  A program most likely will tell the
run-time linker, <literal>/lib/ld.so</literal>, to look for shared
libraries in <filename>/lib</filename>, <filename>/usr/lib</filename>,
<filename>/usr/local/lib</filename>, or
<filename>/usr/X11R6/lib</filename>, if it's an X client.  But that
doesn't mean that libraries can't be installed elsewhere.  It helps to
have some idea of the original library configuration before
proceeding.
</para>
<para>
Also be sure to run <literal>ldconfig</literal> after creating the
symbolic link, so that <literal>ld.so</literal> has an updated view
of the system's libraries.  You should also make certain that all of
the library directories are listed in
<filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename>, and perhaps in the
<literal>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</literal> environment variable.

<title>The X Window System</title>
<sect2 label="11.1">
<title id="linux-support-x">Does Linux Support X?</title>
<para>
Yes. Linux uses XFree86 (the current version is 4.0, which is based
on X11R6). You need to have a video card which is supported by
XFree86. See the <citetitle>XFree86 HOWTO</citetitle> for more details.

Most Linux distributions nowadays come with an X installation.
However, you can install or upgrade your own, from
<ulink url="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/Xfree86-*">
<literal>"ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/Xfree86-*"</literal></ulink>

<title id="get-x-window-system-work">
How Do I Get the X Window System to Work?</title>
<para>
The answers to this question can, and do, fill entire books. If the
installation program wasn't able to configure the X server correctly,
Linux will most likely try to start the X display, fail, and drop back
into text-only terminal mode.
</para>
<para>
First and foremost, make certain that you have provided, as closely as
possible, the correct information to the installation program of your
video hardware: the video card and monitor. Some installation programs
can correctly guess a ``least common denominator'' screen configuration,
like a 640-by-480 VESA-standard display, but there are many possible
video hardware configurations that may not be able to display this
standard.
</para>
<para>
The X Window System configuration file is called (usually)
<filename>/etc/XF86Config</filename>, 
<filename>/etc/X11/XF86Config</filename>, or
<filename>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config</filename>.
</para>
<para>
If you need to manually configure the X server, there are several
possible methods:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
Try to use the <command>XF86Setup</command> program, which 
can help identify the
correct X server and monitor timings for the video hardware.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> 
Make sure that the X server has the correct
options. If you log in as the superuser, you should be able to use
<literal>X --probeonly</literal> to get a listing of the video card
chipset, memory, and any special graphics features. Also, refer to the
manual page for the X server. (E.g.; <literal>man X</literal>), and
try running the X server and redirecting the standard error output to
a file so you can determine, after you can view text on the screen
again, what error messages the server is generating; e.g., <literal>X
2>x.error</literal>.  
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
With that information, you should be able to safely refer to one
of the references provided by the Linux Documentation Project. 
("Where can I get the HOWTO's and other documentation? ")
There are several HOWTO's on the subject, including a HOWTO to
calculate video timings manually if necessary. Also, the
<citetitle>Installation and Getting Started</citetitle> guide 
has a chapter with a step-by-step guide to writing a 
<filename>XF86Config</filename> file.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>    
<para>
Also, make sure that the problem really is an incorrect 
<filename>XF86Config</filename>
file, not something else like the window manager failing to start. If
the X server is working correctly, you should be able to move the
mouse cursor on the screen, and pressing 
<keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>Backspace</keycap></keycombo> will shut
down the X server and return to the shell prompt in one of the virtual
terminals.

Where Can I Get a Ready-Made <filename>XF86Config</filename> for My System?</title>

If you can't seem to get X working using the guidelines above, refer
to the <citetitle>XFree86 HOWTO</citetitle>, recent versions of 
<citetitle>Installation and
Getting Started</citetitle>, and the instructions for the 
<filename>XF86Setup</filename> program.

The contents of the <filename>XF86Config</filename> file 
depend on the your exact
combination of video card and monitor. It can either be configured by
hand, or using the <command>XF86Setup</command> utility. 
Read the instructions that came
with XFree86, in <filename>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/etc</filename>. 
The file you probably need to
look at most is <filename>README.Config</filename>.

You should not use the sample <filename>XF86Config.eg</filename> 
file which is included
with newer versions of XFree86 verbatim, because the wrong video clock
settings can damage your monitor.

Please don't post to <citetitle>comp.os.linux.x</citetitle>

please don't answer such requests.

If you have a laptop, look at the Linux Laptop Web page (``<xref

If you wish to refer to a question in the FAQ, it's better for me if
you do so by the question heading, rather than number. The question
numbers are generated automatically, and I don't see them in the
source file I edit.

I prefer comments in English to patch files&mdash;context diff is not my
first language.
