<title>What is Emacspeak?</title>

	<para> 
	Many users are familiar with Emacs as a text editor and have
	used it extensively in that capacity.  But Emacs is not just a
	text editor -- it is actually a desktop, in some ways like the
	graphical desktops that many use today. As a
	desktop, Emacs comes with all kinds of built-in functions, much
	like the Windows &trade desktop, including an e-mail
	application, calendar/appointment program, cd-player, games,
	and more. And like Windows &trade, there are many additional
	applications that you can download and add to Emacs that
	expand its functionality -- web browsers, the LaTeX text
	editor, mp3 players, and others. Unlike Windows, all of these powerful
	tools are under the GPL (Gnu Public License), so you can use them free of charge.
	</para>

	<para>
	For visually impaired users, adding Emacspeak to Emacs might
	be compared to adding Jaws to Windows, except that instead of
	simply reading the screen to you as a standard "screenreader"
	might do, Emacspeak treats speech as first-class
	output. Because Emacspeak interacts directly with Emacs instead of just being an add-on, it provides much more context-specific
	information about what is going on than a typical
	screenreader would. In addition, there are many special
	commands just for Emacspeak that enhance interaction with a variety
	of Emacs applications.
	</para>

<title>About this tutorial</title>

	<para>
	Because Emacs and Emacspeak are unlike any environments you
	may have used before, it helps to know a little bit about how
	they work. This tutorial assumes that you have either used and
	are
	familiar with Emacs and Emacspeak or that you have completed some
	of the Emacs and Emacspeak tutorials. For a list of
	recommended tutorials, please refer to <xref linkend=getting-started>.
	</para>

	<para>
	This tutorial is organized by task and sub-task.  For example,
	the Internet section contains sub-sections on browsing the
	Internet, using email, chatting online, and other tasks. The
	File Manipulation section contains information on downloading
	and installing files, finding files, etc. For a complete
	listing of the available tasks, refer to the table of contents.
	</para>

	<para>
	Within this tutorial, you will find references to a number of
	Emacspeak-enabled applications, some that are included within
	the Emacs application, and some that are add-ons and must
	be downloaded.  Please note that the applications listed in
	this tutorial should not be considered a complete collection of applications but only a
	small subset. The complete list of Emacspeak-enabled
	applications is available at <ulink
	url="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/applications.html"></ulink>.

<sect2 ID="getting-started">
<title>Getting started with Emacs and Emacspeak</title>

	<para>
	Before you get started with Emacs and Emacspeak, you must
	install both. Most distributions come with Emacs, or you can
	download it from the Emacs home page at <ulink
	url="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html"></ulink>.
	If you have not already installed Emacspeak, you can download
	it from <ulink url="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/"></ulink>. For Emacspeak installation

<sect2 ID="emacs-conventions">
<title>Emacs Command Conventions</title>

	<para>
	Emacs commands are denoted by holding down either the
	<command>Control</command> key or the <command>Meta</command> key, then pressing one or
	more alphanumeric keys. On today's keyboards, the
	<command>Alt</command> key provides the same functionality as
	the old <command>Meta</command> key, or alternatively you can
	press the <command>Esc</command> key followed by the
	alphanumeric keys (you don't have to hold down the
	<command>Esc</command> key). Because different documents
	sometimes use different notation to denote these sequences, this section
	explains the notation used in this HOWTO.  For consistency,
	this HOWTO uses the same notation as is used in the Emacs menus. 
	</para>

	<para>
	There are a few different types of key sequences you may
	see. The first is commonly written in the form <command>C-x
	C-s</command>.  The letter "C," followed by a hypen, literally
	means "hold down the Control key" (the letter "M" would denote
	the Meta (Alt or Esc) key), and the additional letters denote
	specific commands.  This example, which saves the current
	file, should be interpreted as, "Hold down the Control key,
	press the letter x followed by the letter s, then release the Control key."
	</para> 

	<para>
	Another common  sequence is written in the form <command>C-x
	d</command>. Again, the letter "C" followed by a hyphen
	denotes holding down the Control key.  However, because the
	second letter of the sequence does not have a "C-" in front of
	it, you do not hold down the Control key while pressing the
	second letter. Thus, this command should be interpreted as,
	"Hold down the Control key and type x, then release the Control key and type d."
	Sometimes you may see commands with more than one letter after
	them, such as <command>C-e d w</command>. The same rules
	apply: you should hold down the Control key, press "e,"
	release the Control key, then press "d" and "w". 
	</para>

	<para>
	Finally, you may see commands that use actual words, such as
	<command>M-x
	emacspeak-toggle-word-echo</command>. Fortunately, most of
	these longer commands have a shorthand command (in this case,
	<command>C-e d w</command>.  However, should you opt to type
	the entire command, you would hold down the Meta or Alt key,
	type x, release the Meta key, then type
	emacspeak-toggle-word-echo. 
	</para>

<title>Getting Help</title>

	<para>
	There are several different types of help you can get from
	within Emacs. If you are unfamiliar with Emacs or Emacspeak,
	refer to Getting Started with Emacs and Emacspeak in <xref linkend="getting-started"> for
	information on several tutorials that can help get you up and
	running.  If you've completed those tutorials and are looking
	for more in-depth help on specific topics, consider the
	following sources.

<sect3 id="man-pages">
<title>Viewing the Linux online man pages</title>

	<para>
	Linux comes with an extensive manual, better known as the
	"man" pages. These pages cover just about every Linux command.  The only
	drawback to using the man pages is that you must know the name of the command you
	want information about.  To read a man entry:

<title>System Administration</title>

	<para>
	This section contains information on common system

<sect2 ID="changing-your-password">
<title>Changing your password</title>
 
	<para>
	Every time you log onto a Linux system, you must provide a
	password for your account. Occasionally you may wish to change
	your password, and many systems require that you do so regularly
	for added security.
	</para>

	<para>
	Changing your password is done in the Emacs shell. Normally,
	changing your password in the Emacs shell displays it on the
	screen and also speaks it aloud. However, Emacspeak adds a line to your
	<filename>.emacs</filename> file that keeps Emacs from echoing
	your password either visually or orally. Of course, it's still
	a good idea to change your password in a secure area where
	no-one is likely to watch you type it in. To change your
	password: 
	</para> 

	<orderedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>
			From inside Emacs, type <command>M-x
			shell</command> to launch an Emacs shell.

			<para>
			At the prompt, type
			<command>passwd</command>. You will be prompted for both your
			current password and your new password. 
			</para>
		</listitem>
	</orderedlist>


	<para>
	Note that some systems require passwords to be a certain
	length or contain certain characters such as numbers. If your
	password entry is rejected for some reason, keep trying.  In general,
	most 6-8 letter passwords that contain at least one number
	work well. Of course, be sure it's easy for you to remember!

</sect2>

<sect2 id="installing-applications">
<title>Installing applications</title>

<sect3 ID="about-emacs-applications">
<title>About Emacs applications</title>

	<para>
	As an Emacs user, you can
	mentally divide applications into two categories: those
	that are native to Emacs (that is, those applications written
	specifically for Emacs),
	and those that are not (for example, command-line applications). If an application is not
	Emacs-native, you can still run it from the Emacs shell
	command line.  To run the application, type the command
	<command>M-x shell</command> to start the shell then the appropriate command to start the
	application. If the application is native to Emacs, you can
	type <command>M-x name-of-application</command> to start the
	application. The application will run directly in the Emacs
	buffer.
	</para>

	<para>
	Sometimes, even though an application wasn't designed
	specifically for Emacs, you can install a special wrapper
	file that makes Emacs think the application is Emacs-native. These
	special files have a <filename>.el</filename>, or
	Emacs-lisp, extension. After you've downloaded and
	installed a new application, if a <filename>.el</filename> file exists for it, you
	can download that file too.  Place it in the correct
	directory, add the appropriate line to your
	<filename>.emacs</filename> file so that Emacs will recognize
	the application, and
	you'll be able to run the application as if it were native to Emacs.  
	</para>

	<para>
	As an Emacspeak user, you'll also want to know which
	applications are Emacspeak-enabled. These Emacspeak-enabled applications have a second
	special <filename>.el</filename> wrapper file that contains Emacspeak-specific commands that provide
	audio feedback just for that application. For a complete list
	of Emacspeak-enabled applications, see <ulink
	url="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/applications.html"></ulink>.
	All avaliable <filename>emacspeak-*.el</filename> files are
	included with Emacspeak, so you won't have to download them.
	</para>

	<para>
	So, when you install a new application,
	you'll need the following three things:
	</para>
		<itemizedlist mark=bullet>
			<listitem>
				<para>
				The application.
				</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>
				A <filename>.el</filename> file for
				that application, if you want to run
				it directly from Emacs instead of from
				the Emacs shell command line.
				</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>
				An
				<filename>emacspeak-*.el</filename>
				file for the application, if you want
				to run it directly from Emacs and have
				it Emacspeak-enabled. Check
				in the /emacspeak/lisp directory
				to see if one exists for your
				application.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

	<para>
	Whenever possible, this HOWTO tells you specifically
	whether or not an application is Emacs-native, and if not,
	where to get the special <filename>.el</filename> wrapper files if they are
	available.
	</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 ID="downloading-applications">
<title>Downloading your application</title>

	<para>
	Once you've chosen a new application to install, you'll need
	to download it. Typically you'll use either
	<application>FTP</application> application or the
	<application>wget</application> application to download your new Linux
	application, since most of them are distributed only on the
	Internet. If you are unfamiliar with the
	<application>FTP</application> and
	<application>wget</application> applications, refer to <xref
	linkend=downloading-files>, Downloading files, for information
	on how to use these applications to get your files.
	</para>

	<para>
	Usually, the files you download will have some sort of extension (the letters after the "dot"
	or "period" in the file name) that denotes what type of file it
	is. If your file has a .gz or .tar extension, refer to <xref
	linkend=uncompressing-files> on uncompressing files.  If your file has a .rpm
	extension, refer to <xref linkend=installing-rpms> on
	installing RPMs.
	</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 ID="uncompressing-files">
<title>Uncompressing files</title>

	<para>
	Most files are compressed in at least one (and
	sometimes multiple) ways. You can tell how a file was
	compressed, and thus how to uncompress it, by the extensions
	on the file.  The most common extensions are .tar and .gz,
	though there are others.
	</para>

	<para>
	If your downloaded file has multiple extensions, you'll have
	to uncompress it one step at a time, uncompressing the last
	extension first.  For example, if the file is named
	<filename>foo.tar.gz</filename>, complete the following steps:
	</para>	

	<orderedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>
			Start the <application>Emacs</application>
			shell using the command <command>M-x shell</command>.
			</para>
		</listitem>

		<listitem>
			<para>
			If necessary, use the <command>cd</command>
			(change directory) command to move to the
			directory that contains your downloaded file.
			</para>
		</listitem>
	
		<listitem>
			<para>
			At the Emacs shell command prompt, type
			<command>gunzip foo.tar.gz</command>. The
			file will be unzipped, leaving you
			with a file called
			<filename>foo.tar</filename> in your
			directory. Files with a .tar extension are commonly known as "tarballs."
			</para>
		</listitem>

		<listitem>
			<para>
			At the command prompt, type <command>tar -xvf
			foo.tar</command>. The tarball will be uncompressed, usually
			leaving either a single file or a new
			directory that contains a number of files.
			</para>

			<para>
			Some recent versions of the
			<command>tar</command> command will both
			uncompress and untar a file if you add the
			<command>-z</command> option. Thus, the
			command <command>tar -xvfz
			foo.tar.gz</command> would both uncompress and
			untar the file.
			</para>

<sect2 ID="calendar-and-appointments">
<title>Scheduling appointments and calendar events</title>

	<para>
	Emacs has a built-in desk calendar that includes a diary for
	planned events. The calendar and diary support both US and
	European date formats, but default to the US format. The diary
	keeps track of appointments and reminders using a diary file, a text file that contains a list of events and their
	dates. You can have Emacs send you an email every day with
	your schedule, or you can look at the calendar to view the
	day's events.
	</para>

	<para>
	To start the calendar application, use the
	command <command>M-x calendar</command>. Calendar navigation
	commands are, for the most part, identical to text navigation
	commands, and you can also use the arrow keys to navigate.
	</para>

	<para>
 	If you'd like to use the diary, you need to create a diary
	file that contains your events.  The diary file is a simple text file,
	and, by default, Emacs uses <filename>~/diary</filename> as the
	diary file. Although you'll need to create the file manually,
	there are commands that allow you to add, view, and change
	diary entries. Most of these commands are Emacspeak-enabled.
	</para>
 
	<para>
	Diary entries come in a number of formats and entries can be
	set to repeat.  Below are some examples:
	</para>
	
	<simplelist type=horiz columns=3>
		<member>12/22/2001	</member>		
		<member>Mom arrives for visit	</member>
		<member>Appears once on 12/22/2001</member>
		<member>October 17	</member>
		<member>Joe's birthday	</member>
		<member>Repeats yearly on October 17th</member>
		<member>Friday	</member>
		<member>Time cards due	</member>
		<member>Repeats every Friday</member>
	</simplelist>

	<para>
	Of course, there are many more options than those shown here.
	You can find a complete listing of diary features in the
	GNU Emacs manual, located at <ulink
	url="http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/emacs/emacs_376.html"></ulink>.
	</para>

	<para>
	You can view the diary entries for the current date using the
	command <command>M-x diary</command>. Alternatively, you can
	have the day's appointments automatically displayed when you
	enter Emacs by adding the following line to your
	<filename>.emacs</filename> file:
	</para>

	<programlisting>
	(diary)
	</programlisting>

	<para>
	You can also have your events emailed to you on a daily basis
	by running the command <command>M-x
	diary-mail-entries</command>.  You'll probably get an error
	message the first time you do this that says, "No buffer named *Fancy
	Diary Entries*." This error message was reported as a bug to
	the bug-gnu-emacs mailing list by Tim Hesterberg.
	However, the command does in fact work, so you can just ignore
	the error message. By default, you'll be e-mailed the
	calendar entries for the next seven days.  Also, when you
	enter Emacs it will automatically show you the calendar
	entries for the next seven days. According to the GNU Emacs
	Manual, there is a way to change the
	number of days the email covers, but according to Tim that
	feature also has bugs and doesn't seem to work. At the time of writing, these problems have not been
	addressed.

<title>Burning a CD</title>

	<para>
	It's become almost necessary to have a CD burner these days,
	especially if you want to download iso images to install new
	versions of Linux. The <application>cdrecord</application>
	application is the
	recommended tool for burning both audio and data CDs, and it
	is included in many distributions. However, if you'd like to
	get the latest version, go to <ulink
	url="http://www.fokus.gmd.de/research/cc/glone/employees/joerg.schilling/private/cdrecord.html"></ulink>.
	</para>

	<para>
	<application>cdrecord</application> is a command-line
	application, so you'll need to open an Emacs command shell
	(<command>M-x shell</command>) to use it.
	</para>

	<para>
	The complete directions on how to use
	<application>cdrecord</application> burn a CD are beyond the
	scope of this document; however Winfried Trmper wrote an
	excellent HOWTO on making both data and audio CDs, which is
	available at <ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/CD-Writing-HOWTO.html"></ulink>. If
	you are new to burning CDs in Linux, this document is

<title>Playing CDs</title>

	<para>
	The best tool for playing CDs in Emacs is
	<application>cd-tool</application>. An Emacspeak-enabled
	version is included with your Emacspeak
	distribution. 
	</para>

	<para>
	All of the commands that control
	<application>cd-tool</application> must be prefaced by the
	command <command>M-x cd-tool</command>. After you type this, you will be
	prompted to enter the command to execute.  For example, if you
	wanted to start playing a CD, you would type <command>M-x
	cd-tool</command>, then at the prompt type
	<command>p</command> (for 'play'). The CD will then start
	playing.

<title>Playing mp3s</title>

	<para>
	To play an mp3 music file, you'll need the application
	<application>mpg123</application>.  Although the application is included in a number of
	distributions, the standard version is not Emacs-native, so
	you'll need to download an install the Emacs-enabled
	version. You can download the file
	<filename>mpg123-el-1.24-1.tar.gz</filename> (the latest
	Emacs-enabled version) from Debian at <ulink

	<para>
	For a full list of <application>mpg123</application> commands,
	you can scroll up and down within the application to have them
	read aloud.
	</para>

	<para>
	One note about volume in <application>mpg123</application>: in
	my tests, I found that often the system volume would go way
	down when I started <application>mpg123</application>, to the
	point where I could barely hear it. If I exited
	<application>mpg123</application>, the volume in Emacspeak would continue
	to be extremely low, regardless of how it was set before I
	started <application>mpg123</application>.  However, if I
	turned up the volume while in
	<application>mpg123</application>, not only was it at an
	acceptable level in <application>mpg123</application>, it was
	also loud after I quit <application>mpg123</application>.
	</para>

	<para>
	Another problem that I noticed when using
	<application>mpg123</application> is that sometimes when you
	quit the application, it doesn't seem to relinquish control of
	the sound card. You'll see evidence of this behavior if you
	try to play a CD or restart <application>mpg123</application>
	- you'll get an error message saying that your sound card is
	busy or that it's not installed correctly. If you check the
	list of open Emacs buffers, you'll see that
	<application>mpg123</application> is still there, although
	it's apparently in a questionable state. I have not yet
	figured out how to remedy this problem; if anyone has any
	suggestions, please let me know so it can be added to the
	HOWTO. 
	</para>

	<para>
	If you find yourself listening to a lot of MP3s, there is an
	mp3 jukebox written by Karl Dahlke available at <ulink
	url="http://www.eklhad.net/linux/app/jukebox"></ulink>, and a
	sample config file for the jukebox at <ulink
	url="http://www.eklhad.net/linux/app/sample.jukerc"></ulink>.
	At the time of writing, the jukebox was in version 1.0.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	If you want to rip your own MP3s, under Linux it is a
	two step process.  The first step is to convert the tracks on
	an audio CD to <filename>.wav</filename> format, then convert
	the <filename>.wav</filename> files to MP3s. There is a great
	web page by Nathan Robertson on how to do this, located at
	<ulink
	url="http://www.nathanr.net/thisout/articles/linux-mp3/"></ulink>.
