				  <section> <title>Version 1 - Version 3</title> <para> Thanks
to everyone that gave comments as I was writing this. This includes David
Lawyer, Deb Richardson, Daniel Barlow, Greg Ferguson, Mark Craig and other
members of the <email>discuss@en.tldp.org</email> list. Some sections I
got from the <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/">HOWTO Index</ulink>
and the sgmltools documentation. The sections on network access to CVS was
partially written by Sergiusz Pawlowicz
(<email>ser@metalab.unc.edu</email>). Sections on DocBook were written by
Jorge Godoy (<email>godoy@conectiva.com</email>).  A great deal of thanks
to both of them for their help.  </para> </section>

					 <section> <title>Version 4</title> <para> Thanks to
Tabatha Marshall and Machtelt Garrel (Tille) for making sure I actually
finished the document. To my reviewers: Charles Curley, Martin
Brown and Tille; and to Saqib Ali for his on-line transformation and
validation tools. [EJH]</para> </section> </section>
