	If you are comfortable working with markup languages and

	are some of the more common text editors that can, with
	some tweaking, handle DocBook files.

	The epcEdit program allows you to edit XML files.

	To be fair, nedit is more
   for programmers, so it might seem a bit of overkill for new
   users and especially non-programmers.  All that aside, it's
   extremely powerful, allowing for syntax highlighting.  Unlike
   epcEdit, nedit doesn't allow you to automatically insert tags
   or automatically validate your code.  However, it does allow
   for shell commands to be run against the contents of the
   window (as opposed to saving the file, then checking).

<title>Using nedit</title>
<para>When you open your DocBook file nedit should already
have syntax highlighting enabled. If it does not you can
turn it on explicitly using:
	<menuchoice>
		<guimenu>Preferences</guimenu>
		<guimenuitem>Language Mode</guimenuitem>
		<guimenuitem>SGML HTML</guimenuitem>
	</menuchoice>

<para>
  If you have line numbers turned on (using
  <menuchoice><guimenu>Preferences</guimenu><guimenuitem>Show
  Line Numbers</guimenuitem></menuchoice>) then finding
  validation errors is much simpler.
  <application>nsgmls</application>, the validation tool
  we'll use, lists errors by their line number.

	This is a commercial application which is currently
		available for free (with an optional user registration).
		It is written in Java, allowing it to run on any platform 
		that has a JVM (that is, works in both
      Windows and Linux).
</para>
<para>
	On the plus sides of XMLEditor is the left side of the
      screen shows the hierarchy of the document (starting with Book
      and so on).  Selecting an item in the list brings you to that
      part of the document so you can edit it.  The right part of the
      screen shows the text without any markup or tags being shown.
      If you have external files as ELEMENTS (as the LDP Author Guide
      does), XMLEditor will follow the links and load the files, so
      you always work on the entire work.  On the minus side of this,
      you will get errors if a file is missing.
