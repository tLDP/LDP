   PSGML works with DocBook, LinuxDoc and other DTDs equally well.

<title>Verifying PSGML is Installed</title>
<para> 
	If you have installed a recent distribution, you may
        already have PSGML installed for use with Emacs. To check,
        start Emacs and look for the PSGML documentation (<keycombo
        moreinfo="none"><keycap moreinfo="none">C</keycap><keycap
        moreinfo="none">h</keycap></keycombo><keycap

	If you don't have PSGML installed now might be a good

<title>Configuring Emacs for Use With PSGML</title>
<para> 
	If you want GNU Emacs to enter PSGML mode when you open
   an <filename class="extension">.xml</filename> file, it
	will need to be able to find the DocBook DTD files.
	If your distribution already had PSGML set up for use 
	with GNU Emacs, you probably won't need to do anything.

	I'm trying to make each section only deal with its own
	information instead of information being repeated times
	each editor. If there's even more than can be stripped
	out of the (very long) emacs section, please feel free to
	hack away. Maybe there's even another HOWTO that explains
	how to set up Emacs for use with SGML/XML files? I've
	actually done a fair amount of hacking, so things may
	already be a little more balanced.

	Once you've configured your system to use PSGML you will
	need to override Emacs' default <emphasis>sgml-mode</emphasis> with the
	<emphasis>psgml-mode</emphasis>. This can be done by configuring your
	<filename>.emacs</filename> file. After you've edited the
	configuration file you will need to restart Emacs.
