    <para>
      The LDP is providing CVS access to authors. There are a few
      good reasons for this:
    </para>

    <orderedlist inheritnum="ignore" continuation="restarts">
      <listitem>
        <para> CVS will keep an off-site backup of your documents. In
        the event that you hand over a document to another author,
        they can just retrieve the document from CVS and continue
        on. In the event you need to go back to a previous version of
        a document, you can retrieve it as well.  </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para> It's great to have many people working on the same
        document. You can have CVS tell you what changes were made
        while you were editing your copy by another author, and
        integrate those changes in.  </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>CVS keeps a log of what changes were made. These logs (and
        a date stamp) can be placed automatically inside the document
        when you use some special tags that get processed before the
        SGML processor.  </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para> It can provide for a way for a program to automatically
      update the LDP web site with new documentation as it's written
      and submitted. This is not in place yet, but it is a potential
      goal. Currently, CVS updates signal the HOWTO coordinator to
      update the LDP web page, meaning that if you use CVS, you're not
      required to e-mail your XML code. (Although you do
      still need to send the submit list an email when you
      are ready for your document to be published.) </para>
