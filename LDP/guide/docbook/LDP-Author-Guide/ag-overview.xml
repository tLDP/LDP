	<title>Contributing to The LDP</title>
	 <para>So you want to help out but you're not sure where to start? 
	The easiest way is to find something and document it. Also check 
	the <ulink url="http://tldp.org/authors/unmaint.html">unmaintained HOWTOs</ulink> and see if there is a
      subject there that you know about and can continue
      documenting. </para>

    <section id="process">
      <title>Summary of The LDP Process</title>
      <para>If you are new to the LDP and want to pick up an
      unmaintained HOWTO or write a new HOWTO document, join the discussion
      list at
      <ulink url="http://lists.tldp.org">http://lists.tldp.org</ulink>.
      This is to make sure the LDP knows who is working on what
      documentation.</para> 
      
	  <para>Once that part is complete, you may write your
      documentation <emphasis>in the format of your choice</emphasis> and submit a draft to
      <email>submit@en.tldp.org</email>. The draft will
      be reviewed by an LDP volunteer. In a few short days you will
      get the draft and comments from the volunteer.  After applying
      the comments, you may send this version to the submit list
      again for final submission into the LDP. Review criteria are available
	  in the <ulink url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LDP-Reviewer-HOWTO/">LDP Reviewer 
	  HOWTO</ulink>. You should read the LDP  Reviewer HOWTO
	 yourself before
	  submitting your documentation. (Don't worry, the Reviewer HOWTO pretty short
	  compared to the LDP Author Guide.)</para> 

      <note>
        <para>
          Reviewers:  Please consult the <ulink
		  url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LDP-Reviewer-HOWTO/">LDP Reviewer HOWTO</ulink> for information
          about how to review various forms of LDP documentation.
        </para>
      </note>

      <para>At this point, another LDP volunteer will translate your
      document into DocBook and send you the finished DocBook
      document.  From here on, all submissions to the LDP must be in
      DocBook format.  If you have markup questions, you may ask the
      volunteer who assisted you, or ask the LDP DocBook list. For
	more information about the LDP DocBook list please read <xref linkend="mailinglists"/>.</para>

      <para>If you choose to start your document off in DocBook, there
      are plenty of templates to get you started. Check <xref linkend="templates"/> for details.

    <section id="mailinglists">
      <title>Mailing Lists</title>
      <para>There are a few mailing lists to subscribe to so you can
      take part in how the LDP works.</para>
	  
	  <itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>First is <email>discuss@en.tldp.org</email>, which is the main
      discussion group of the LDP.</para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para>Another is the <email>docbook@en.tldp.org</email> list, which is for
      markup or other questions about DocBook itself.  If you run into
      trouble with a particular markup tag, you can send your question
      here for answers.</para></listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	  
	  <para>You can subscribe to either list by sending a "subscribe"
	  message to either <email>discuss-subscribe@en.tldp.org</email> or 
	  <email>docbook-subscribe@en.tldp.org</email> with a subject reading  
      <quote>subscribe</quote> (no quotes). To
      remove yourself from the list, send an e-mail with the subject of
      <quote>unsubscribe</quote> to
	  <email>discuss-unsubscribe@en.tldp.org</email> or
	  <email>docbook-unsubscribe@en.tldp.org</email>.</para>

      <para>
        There is also a mailing list run by OASIS that can also
        answer DocBook questions.  Please see <ulink url="http://docbook.org/mailinglist/index.html">http://docbook.org/mailinglist/index.html</ulink>
        for more information about the mailing lists. We prefer our own list, 
		but only because the LDP list focuses more on tag usage
        than other questions such as formatting.
