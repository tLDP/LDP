      <para>There are many ways to contribute to the Linux movement
      without actually writing code.  One of the most important is
      writing documentation, allowing each person to share their
      knowledge with thousands of others around the world.  This Guide
      is designed to help you get familiar with how the LDP works, and
      what tools you'll need to write your own HOWTO.</para>

        collaborate in all of the issues of Linux documentation. This
        includes the creation of "HOWTOs" and "Guides". We hope to
        establish a system of documentation for Linux that will be
        easy to use and search. This includes the integration of the
        manual pages, info docs, HOWTOs, and other documents.</para>

    <title>Introduction to the LDP and SGML</title>

    <section id="theldp">
      <title>The LDP</title>
      <para>The Linux Documentation Project (LDP) was started to
      provide new users a way of getting information quickly about a
      particular subject. It not only contains a series of books on
      administration, networking, and programming, but has a large
      number of smaller works on individual subjects, written by those
      who have used it. If you want to find out about printing, you
      get the <ulink
      url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Printing-HOWTO.html">Printing
      HOWTO</ulink>. If you want to do find out if your Ethernet card
      works with Linux, grab the <ulink
      url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Ethernet-HOWTO.html">Ethernet
      HOWTO</ulink>, and so on. At first, many of these works were in
      text or HTML. As time went on, there had to be a better way of
      managing these documents. One that would let you read it from a
      web page, a text file on a CD-ROM, or even your hand-held
      PDA. The answer, as it turns out, is SGML.</para> 
    </section>

    <section id="sgml">
      <title>SGML</title>
      <para>The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) is a
      language that is based on embedding codes within a document. In
      this way, it is similar to HTML, but there is where any
      similarities end. The power of SGML is that unlike WYSIWYG (What
      You See Is What You Get), you don't define things like colors,
      or font sizes, or even some kinds of formatting. Instead, you
      define elements (paragraph, section, numbered list) and let the
      SGML processor and the end program worry about placement,
      colors, fonts, and so on. HTML does the same thing, and is
      actually a subset of SGML. SGML has really three parts that make
      it up. First is the Structure, which is what is commonly called
      the DTD, or Document Type Definition. The DTD defines the
      relationship between each of the elements (or tags). The DocBook
      DTD, used to create this document, is an example of this. The
      DTD lists the rules that the content must follow. Second is the
      DSSSL or Document Style Semantics and Specification Language.
      The DSSSL tells the program doing the rendering how to convert
      the SGML into something that a human can read.  It tells the
      renderer to convert a &lt;title&gt; tag into 14 point bold if it
      is going to RTF format, or to turn it into a &lt;h1&gt; tag if
      you're going to HTML. Finally there is the Content, which is
      what gets rendered by the SGML processor and is eventually seen
      by the user. This paragraph is content, but so would a graphic
      image, table, numbered list, and so on. Content is surrounded by
      tags to separate out each element.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="whysgml">
      <title>Why SGML instead of HTML or other formats?</title>
      <para>SGML provides for more than just formatting. You can
      automatically build indexes, table of contents, and links within
      the document or to outside. The Jade and OpenJade packages also
      let you export (I'll call it render from here on) SGML to LaTeX,
      info, text, HTML, and RTF. From these basic formats, you can
      then create other formats such as MS Word, PostScript, PDF and
      so on. Programs like LyX allow you to write in TeX format, then
      export it as SGML and render from SGML to whatever you chose. In
      the end, SGML is more concerned about the way elements work
      instead of the way they look. A big distinction,and one that
      will let you write faster, since you don't have to worry about
      placement of paragraphs, font sizes, font types, and so
      on.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="sgmlisnotxml">
      <title>SGML is not XML</title>
      <para>There has been a lot of press recently about XML, and DocBook
      support for XML.  DocBook is a collection of markup tags that follow
      a specified hierarchy.
      XML tools for authors are not quite as far advanced
      as their SGML counterparts, so the LDP is refraining from using XML
      markups.  At this time, only SGML is accepted by the LDP.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="newauthors">
      <title>For New Authors</title>
      <para>If you are a new to the LDP and want to pick up an
      unmaintained HOWTO or write a new HOWTO document, contact the
      HOWTO coordinator at
      <email>ldp-discuss@lists.linuxdoc.org</email>. This is to make
      sure the HOWTO coordinator can know who is working on what
      documentation.</para> 
      <para>Once that part is complete, you may write your
      documentation in the format of your choice and submit a draft to
      <email>ldp-submit@lists.linuxdoc.org</email> and the draft will
      be reviewed by an LDP volunteer. In a few short days you will
      get the draft and comments from the volunteer.  After applying
      the comments, you may send this version to the ldp-submit list
      again for final submission into the LDP.</para> 
      <para>At this point, another LDP volunteer will translate your
      document into DocBook and send you the finished DocBook
      document.  From here on, all submissions to the LDP has to be in
      DocBook format.  If you have markup questions, you may ask the
      volunteer who assisted you, or ask the LDP DocBook list.</para>
      <para>If you choose to start your document off in DocBook, there
      are plenty of templates to get you started:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>
          <ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/authors/template-ld/big-howto-template-ld.sgml">http://www.linuxdoc.org/authors/template-ld/big-howto-template-ld.sgml</ulink> - 
          This template is written by Stein Gojen
          and is based off the LinuxDoc template.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem><para><ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/authors/template/big-howto-template.sgml">http://www.linuxdoc.org/authors/template/big-howto-template.sgml</ulink> - This template is based on Stein's work, but is much larger
      and complicated than the above.  It uses more features of DocBook.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>

    <section id="mailinglists">
      <title>Mailing Lists</title>
      <para>There are a few mailing lists to subscribe to so you can
      take part in how the LDP works. First is
      <email>ldp-discuss@lists.linuxdoc.org</email>, which is the main
      discussion group of the LDP. To subscribe, send a message with
      the subject reading &quot;subscribe&quot; to
      <email>ldp-discuss-request@lists.linuxdoc.org</email>. To
      unsubscribe, send an e-mail with the subject of
      &quot;unsubscribe&quot; to
      <email>ldp-discuss-request@lists.linuxdoc.org</email>.</para>
      <para>Another list is the
      <email>ldp-docbook@lists.linuxdoc.org</email> list, which is for
      markup or other questions about DocBook itself.  If you run into
      trouble with a particular markup tag, you can send your question
      here for answers.  You can subscribe to the DocBook list by
      sending a "subscribe"message to
      <email>ldp-docbook-request@lists.linuxdoc.org</email>.</para>

  <chapter id="tools">
    <title>The tools</title>
    <para>In this section, we will cover some of the tools that you'll
    need or want to use to create your own LDP documentation. I'll
    describe them here, and better define them later on, along with
    how to install them. If you use some other tool to assist in
    writing LDP, please let me know and I'll add a blurb here for
    it.</para>

        <para>The Document Style Semantics and Specification Language
        tells jade how to render a SGML document into print or online
        form. The DSSSL is what converts a title tag into an
        &lt;H1&gt; tag in HTML, or bold, 14 point Times Roman for RTF,
        for example. Documentation for DSSSL is located at the same
        site. Note that modifying the DSSSL doesn't modify DocBook
        itself. It merely changes the way the rendered text looks. The
        LDP uses a modified DSSSL (see below).</para>

        <para> If you have installed a recent distribution, you may
        already have PSGML installed for use with Emacs. To check,
        start Emacs and look for the PSGML documentation (<keycombo

        moreinfo="none">h</keycap></keycombo><keycap

        <para> From here on, we assume you have PSGML installed for
        use with a recent version of GNU Emacs. If that all went by
        too fast for you, see the free chapter from Bob Ducharme's
        SGML CD book: <ulink

        <title> Updating your .emacs to use PSGML </title>
        <para> If you want GNU Emacs to enter PSGML mode when you open
        a <emphasis>.sgml</emphasis> file and be ready for SGML
        editing, make sure PSGML can find the DocBook DTD. If your
        distribution already had PSGML set up for use with GNU Emacs,
        you probably do not have to do anything to get this to
        work. Otherwise, you may need to set an environment variable
        that tells PSGML where to look for the SGML catalog (the list
        of DTDs). </para> 
        <para> For example: </para>
        <screen format="linespecific">
<prompt>bash$</prompt> <command>export SGML_CATALOG_FILES=/usr/lib/sgml/catalog</command>
</screen>
        <para> Then add something like the following to your .emacs
        file: </para>

        to have the SGML Validate automatically run.  Under Command
        Input, select window,  and under Command Output, select
        dialog.  Under Command to Execute, enter  nsgmls -sv.  Note
        that <command>nsgmls</command> has to be in your
        <envar>PATH</envar>  for this to work properly. </para>

        The <command>nedit</command> program will fire up and check
        the contents of the window.  The reason for using -sv is that
        the -v tells <command>nsgmls</command> to output the version
        of the program, so you'll always get ouput and know that
        <command>nsgmls</command> has run.  If all you get is a
        version number, then there are no errors with the document.
        If there are errors, then they'll be listed in the separate
        window for you to see.  If you have line numbers turned on
        (using
        <menuchoice><guimenu>Preferences</guimenu><guimenuitem>Show
        Line Numbers</guimenuitem></menuchoice>) then finding the
        errors is much simpler, as <command>nsgmls</command> will list
        errors by their line number.</para>

    <section id="images">
      <title>Including Images</title>
      <para>If you plan on including images in your HOWTOs, you can
      now do this, as LinuxDoc didn't support images.  Here's a sample
      way of including an image in your HOWTOS:</para> 
      <programlisting format="linespecific">
<sgmltag class="starttag">figure</sgmltag>
   <sgmltag class="starttag">title</sgmltag>LyX screen shot<sgmltag class="endtag">title</sgmltag>
   <sgmltag class="starttag">mediaobject</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag class="starttag">imageobject</sgmltag>
         <sgmltag class="starttag">imagedata fileref="lyx_screenshot.eps" format="eps"</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag class="endtag">imageobject</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag class="starttag">imageobject</sgmltag>
         <sgmltag class="starttag">imagedata fileref="lyx_screenshot.jpg" format="jpg"</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag class="endtag">imageobject</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag class="starttag">textobject</sgmltag>
         <sgmltag class="starttag">phrase</sgmltag>Screen shot of the LyX document processing program<sgmltag class="endtag">phrase</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag class="endtag">textobject</sgmltag>
   <sgmltag class="endtag">mediaobject</sgmltag>
<sgmltag class="endtag">figure</sgmltag>
</programlisting>
      <para>This is a better way than using <sgmltag
      class="starttag">graphic</sgmltag> for two reasons.  First, 
      <sgmltag class="starttag">graphic</sgmltag> will be removed in 
      DocBook 5.0 in favor of the <sgmltag
      class="starttag">mediaobject</sgmltag> tag.  So you may as well
      get started with the right way now.  Second, <sgmltag
      class="starttag">mediaobject</sgmltag> allows for different kinds
      of media based on what the output is. In this example, the first
      <sgmltag class="starttag">imageobject</sgmltag> is an encapsulated
      PostScript(eps) file for use with formats derived from TeX such as
      DVI, PS, and PDF. The second <sgmltag
      class="starttag">imageobject</sgmltag> is a JPEG image for visual
      display, mostly for HTML output. The <sgmltag
      class="starttag">textobject</sgmltag> is presented if the output
      doesn't support graphics (TXT).  Think of it as an <sgmltag
      class="starttag">alt</sgmltag> tag.</para> 
    </section> 
    
    <section id="namedfiles">
      <title>Naming separate HTML files</title>
      <para>By default, when separate HTML files are made, the SGML
      processor will assign arbitrary names to the resulting files.
      This can be confusing to readers who may bookmark a page only to
      have it change, or so you know what files are what.  Whatever
      your reasoning, here's how to make separate files named the way
      you want:</para> 
      <para>In your first <sgmltag class="starttag">article</sgmltag>
      tag (which should be the only one) include an id parameter and
      call it index.  This will make your tag look like this:</para> 

      <programlisting format="linespecific">
<sgmltag class="starttag">article id="index"</sgmltag>
</programlisting>

      <para>On the first <sgmltag class="starttag">chapter</sgmltag>
      tag, do not modify it, as it's usually an introduction and you
      want that on the first page.  For each other <sgmltag
      class="starttag">section</sgmltag> tag, include the id parameter
      and name it.  Names should include only alphanumeric characters,
      and it should be short enough to understand what it is.</para>

      <title>Using ldp.dsl</title>
      <para>The LDP uses its own DSSSL file, which adds things like a

      <para> Second, get someone to review your documentation for
      comments and factual correctness. The documentation that is
      published by the LDP needs to be as factually correct as
      possible, as there are millions of Linux users that may be
      reading it. If you're part of a larger mailing list talking
      about the subject, ask others from the list to help you
      out. </para> 
      <para> Third, create a web site where you can distribute your

      url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/manifesto.html">http://www.linuxdoc.org/manifesto.html</ulink>.
      As an author, you may retain the copyright and add other
      restrictions (for example, you must approve any translations or
      derivative works). A sample license is available in the
      Manifesto or at <ulink
      url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/COPYRIGHT.html">http://www.linuxdoc.org/COPYRIGHT.html</ulink>.
      If you choose to use the boilerplate copyright, simply copy it
      into your source code under a section called <quote>Copyright
      and Licenses</quote> or similar. Also include a copyright
      statement of your own (since you still own it). If you are a new
      maintainer for an already-existing HOWTO, you must include the
      previous copyright statements of the previous author(s) and the
      dates they maintained that document. </para> 

      <para>You'll note that the licensing for the LDP Authoring Guide
      requires notification to the author of any derivative works or
      translations.  I also explicitly place any source code (aside
      from the SGML the Guide was written in) under the GPL. If your
      HOWTO includes bits of source code that you want others to use,
      you may do the same.</para>

      <para> Be sure to include the name of your HOWTO in the subject

    <title>Maintaining Your HOWTO</title>

    <para>
      Just because your HOWTO has now been published doesn't mean your
      job is done. HOWTOs need regular maintenance, to make sure they
      are up to date, and to improve them in response to readers' ideas
      and suggestions. A HOWTO is a living, growing body of knowledge,
      not just a publish-and-forget-it static document.
    </para>

    <para>
      You put your email address in the HOWTO, and politely requested
      feedback from your readers, right? Once you are officially published,
      you will begin to receive notes with suggestions. Some will be
      very valuable; others will request personal assistance. You should
      feel free to decline personal assistance if you cannot spare the
      time. Writing a HOWTO for the LDP doesn't commit you to a lifetime
      of free support for anyone on the net. It is polite to refer
      questioners to another resource, if you can. And, if you see a
      pattern in the questions you receive, it might indicate a topic
      you should add to your HOWTO.

        <para>But I don't know SGML/Can't get the tools working/Don't
        like SGML</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para> That's okay.  You have the option of writing your first
        draft of the HOWTO in the format of your choice, then submit
        that to the LDP.  An LDP volunteer will review the document,
        then convert it into DocBook for you.  Once that's done,it will
        be easier for you to maintain the HOWTO.  If you run into
        questions,you can always drop a line to the LDP volunteer or the
        LDP Docbook list
        at <email>ldp-docbook@lists.linuxdoc.org</email>.</para>
