    <title>Maintaining Your HOWTO</title>
    
  <para>
      Just because your HOWTO has now been published doesn't mean your
      job is done. HOWTOs need regular maintenance, to make sure they
      are up to date, and to improve them in response to readers' ideas
      and suggestions. A HOWTO is a living, growing body of knowledge,
      not just a publish-and-forget-it static document.
  </para>
    
	<para>
		Add relevant mailing lists to your HOWTO where people
		can get support. If you have the time, follow these
		mailing lists yourself to stay up-to-date on the
		latest information.
   </para>
  
  <para>
      Put your email address in the HOWTO, and politely request
      feedback from your readers. Once you are officially published,
      you will begin to receive notes with suggestions.
		Some of these emails will be very valuable. Create a 
		folder in your mail program for
		incoming suggestions--when the time is right review
		the folder and make updates to your document. If you
		are following a related mailing list you may also
		choose to save a copy of important emails from the list to your
		this folder.
	</para>
		
	<note><para>
	Some people who email you will request personal
	assistance.	You should feel free to decline personal 
	assistance if you cannot spare the time. Writing a 
	HOWTO for the LDP does not commit you to a lifetime
   of free support for anyone on the net; however, do try
	to reply to all requests and suggest a mailing list that
	will (hopefully) be able to provide support to your reader.
