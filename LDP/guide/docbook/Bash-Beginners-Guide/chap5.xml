<para>These explanations are far from complete and certainly not meant to be used as the definite user manual for <command>sed</command>.  This chapter is only included in order to show some more interesting topics in the next chapters, and because every power user should have a basic knowledge of things that can be done with this editor.</para>

<sect1 id="sect_05_01"><title>Introduction</title>
<sect2 id="sect_05_01_01"><title>What is sed?</title>
<para>A <application>Stream EDitor</application> is used to perform basic transformations on text read from a file or a pipe.  The result is sent to standard output.  The syntax for the <command>sed</command> command has no output file specification, but results can be saved to a file using output redirection.  The editor does not modify the original input.</para>
<para>What distinguishes <command>sed</command> from other editors, such as <command>vi</command> and <command>ed</command>, is its ability to filter text that it gets from a pipeline feed.  You do not need to interact with the editor while it is running; that is why <command>sed</command> is sometimes called a <emphasis>batch editor</emphasis>.  This feature allows use of editing commands in scripts, greatly easing repetitive editing tasks.  When facing replacement of text in a large number of files, <command>sed</command> is a great help.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_05_01_02"><title>sed commands</title>
<para>The <command>sed</command> program can perform text pattern substitutions and deletions using regular expressions, like the ones used with the <command>grep</command> command; see <xref linkend="sect_04_02" />.</para>
<para>The editing commands are similar to the ones used in the <command>vi</command> editor:</para>

</sect1>
<sect1 id="sect_05_02"><title>Interactive editing</title>
<sect2 id="sect_05_02_01"><title>Printing lines containing a pattern</title>
<para>This is something you can do with <command>grep</command>, of course, but you can't do a <quote>find and replace</quote> using that command.  This is just to get you started.</para>
<para>This is our example text file:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt> <command>cat <option>-n</option> <filename>example</filename></command>
     1  This is the first line of an example text.
     2  It is a text with erors.
     3  Lots of erors.
     4  So much erors, all these erors are making me sick.
     5  This is a line not containing any errors.
     6  This is the last line.

<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt>
</screen>
<para>We want <command>sed</command> to find all the lines containing our search pattern, in this case <quote>erors</quote>.  We use the <command>p</command> to obtain the result:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt> <command>sed  <parameter>'/erors/p'</parameter> <filename>example</filename></command>
This is the first line of an example text.
It is a text with erors.
It is a text with erors.
Lots of erors.
Lots of erors.
So much erors, all these erors are making me sick.
So much erors, all these erors are making me sick.
This is a line not containing any errors.
This is the last line.

<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt>
</screen>
<para>As you notice, <command>sed</command> prints the entire file, but the lines containing the search string are printed twice.  This is not what we want.  In order to only print those lines matching our pattern, use the <option>-n</option> option:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt> <command>sed <option>-n</option> <parameter>'/erors/p'</parameter> <filename>example</filename></command>
It is a text with erors.
Lots of erors.
So much erors, all these erors are making me sick.

<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt>
</screen>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_05_02_02"><title>Deleting lines of input containing a pattern</title>
<para>We use the same example text file.  Now we only want to see the lines <emphasis>not</emphasis> containing the search string:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt> <command>sed <parameter>'/erors/d'</parameter> <filename>example</filename></command>
This is the first line of an example text.
This is a line not containing any errors.
This is the last line.

<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt>
</screen>
<para>The <command>d</command> command results in excluding lines from being displayed.</para>
<para>Matching lines starting with a given pattern and ending in a second pattern are showed like this:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt> <command>sed <option>-n</option> <parameter>'/^This.*errors.$/p'</parameter> <filename>example</filename></command>
This is a line not containing any errors.

<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt>
</screen>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_05_02_03"><title>Ranges of lines</title>
<para>This time we want to take out the lines containing the errors.  In the example these are lines 2 to 4.  Specify this range to address, together with the <command>d</command> command:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt> <command>sed <parameter>'2,4d'</parameter> <filename>example</filename></command>
This is the first line of an example text.
This is a line not containing any errors.
This is the last line.

<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt>
</screen>
<para>To print the file starting from a certain line until the end of the file, use a command similar to this:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt> <command>sed <parameter>'3,$d'</parameter> <filename>example</filename></command>
This is the first line of an example text.
It is a text with erors.

<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt>
</screen>
<para>This only prints the first two lines of the example file.</para>
<para>The following command prints the first line containing the pattern <quote>a text</quote>, up to and including the next line containing the pattern <quote>a line</quote>:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt> <command>sed <option>-n</option> <parameter>'/a text/,/This/p'</parameter> <filename>example</filename></command>
It is a text with erors.
Lots of erors.
So much erors, all these erors are making me sick.
This is a line not containing any errors.

<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt>
</screen>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_05_02_04"><title>Find and replace with sed</title>
<para>In the example file, we will now search and replace the errors instead of only (de)selecting the lines containing the search string.</para>
<screen>
<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt> <command>sed <parameter>'s/erors/errors/'</parameter> <filename>example</filename></command>
This is the first line of an example text.
It is a text with errors.
Lots of errors.
So much errors, all these erors are making me sick.
This is a line not containing any errors.
This is the last line.

<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt>
</screen>
<para>As you can see, this is not exactly the desired effect: in line 4, only the first occurrence of the search string has been replaced, and there is still an 'eror' left.  Use the <command>g</command> command to indicate to <command>sed</command> that it should examine the entire line instead of stopping at the first occurrence of your string:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt> <command>sed <parameter>'s/erors/errors/g'</parameter> <filename>example</filename></command>
This is the first line of an example text.
It is a text with errors.
Lots of errors.
So much errors, all these errors are making me sick.
This is a line not containing any errors.
This is the last line.

<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt>
</screen>
<para>To insert a string at the beginning of each line of a file, for instance for quoting:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt> <command>sed <parameter>'s/^/&gt; /'</parameter> <filename>example</filename></command>
&gt; This is the first line of an example text.
&gt; It is a text with erors.
&gt; Lots of erors.
&gt; So much erors, all these erors are making me sick.
&gt; This is a line not containing any errors.
&gt; This is the last line.

<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt>
</screen>
<para>Insert some string at the end of each line:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt> <command>sed <parameter>'s/$/EOL/'</parameter> <filename>example</filename></command>
This is the first line of an example text.EOL
It is a text with erors.EOL
Lots of erors.EOL
So much erors, all these erors are making me sick.EOL
This is a line not containing any errors.EOL
This is the last line.EOL

<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt>
</screen>
<para>Multiple find and replace commands are separated with individual <option>-e</option> options:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt> <command>sed <option>-e</option> <parameter>'s/erors/errors/g'</parameter> <option>-e</option> <parameter>'s/last/final/g'</parameter> <filename>example</filename></command>
This is the first line of an example text.
It is a text with errors.
Lots of errors.
So much errors, all these errors are making me sick.
This is a line not containing any errors.
This is the final line.

<prompt>sandy ~&gt;</prompt>
</screen>
<para>Keep in mind that by default <command>sed</command> prints its results to the standard output, most likely your terminal window.  If you want to save the output to a file, redirect it:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>sed <option>option</option> <function>'some/expression'</function> <filename>file_to_process</filename> &gt; <filename>sed_output_in_a_file</filename></command></cmdsynopsis>
<tip><title>More examples</title>
<para>Plenty of <command>sed</command> examples can be found in the startup scripts for your machine, which are usually in <filename>/etc/init.d</filename> or <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d</filename>.  Change into the directory containing the initscripts on your system and issue the following command:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>grep <parameter>sed</parameter> <filename>*</filename></command></cmdsynopsis>

<sect2 id="sect_05_03_01"><title>Reading sed commands from a file</title>
<para>Multiple <command>sed</command> commands can be put in a file and executed using the <option>-f</option> option.  When creating such a file, make sure that:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>No trailing white spaces exist at the end of lines.</para></listitem>

<sect1 id="sect_05_04"><title>Summary</title>
<para>The <command>sed</command> stream editor is a powerful command line tool, which can handle streams of data: it can take input lines from a pipe.  This makes it fit for non-interactive use.  The <command>sed</command> editor uses <command>vi</command>-like commands and accepts regular expressions.</para>
<para>The <command>sed</command> tool can read commands from the command line or from a script.  It is often used to perform find-and-replace actions on lines containing a pattern.</para>
