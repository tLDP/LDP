<title>Description</title>

<sect3><title>info</title>
<para>The info program reads Info documents, usually contained in the 
/usr/doc/info directory. Info documents are like man(ual) pages, but
they tend to be more in depth than just explaining the options to a
program.</para></sect3>

<sect3><title>install-info</title>
<para>The install-info program updates the info entries. When the info
program is run a list with available topics (ie: available info documents) will
be presented. The install-info program is used to maintain this list of
available topics. If info files are removed manually, it is also necessary
to delete the topic in the index file as well. This program is used for
that. It also works the other way around when info documents are 
added.</para></sect3>

<sect3><title>makeinfo</title>
<para>The makeinfo program translates Texinfo source documents into various 
formats.  Available formats are: info files, plain text and HTML.</para></sect3>
