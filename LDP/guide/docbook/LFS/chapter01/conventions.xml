<title>Conventions used in this book</title>
<?dbhtml filename="conventions.html" dir="chapter01"?>

<para>To make things easy to follow, there are a number of conventions used
throughout the book. Following are some examples:</para>

<para><userinput>./configure --prefix=/usr</userinput></para>

<blockquote><para>This form of text is designed to be typed exactly 
as seen unless otherwise noted in the surrounding text. It is also used 
in the explanation sections to identify which of the commands is being 
referenced.</para></blockquote>

<para><filename>install-info: unknown option 
`--dir-file=/mnt/lfs/usr/info/dir'</filename></para>

<blockquote><para>This form of text (fixed width text) is showing screen 
output, probably as the result of commands issued, and is also used to 
show filenames, such as <filename>/etc/lilo.conf</filename>.</para></blockquote>

<para><emphasis>Emphasis</emphasis></para>

<blockquote><para>This form of text is used for several purposes in the 
book, mainly to emphasize important points, and to give examples of
what to type.</para></blockquote>

<para><ulink url="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/"/></para>

<blockquote><para>This form of text is used for hyperlinks, both within the 
book and to external pages such as HowTo's, download locations,
websites, etc.</para></blockquote>

<para><screen><userinput>cat &gt; $LFS/etc/group &lt;&lt; "EOF"</userinput>
root:x:0:
bin:x:1:
......
<userinput>EOF</userinput>
</screen>
</para>

<blockquote><para>This type of section is used mainly when creating 
configuration files. The first command (in bold) tells the system to create 
the file $LFS/etc/group from whatever is typed on the following lines until 
the sequence EOF is encountered. Therefore, this whole section is generally 
typed as seen.</para></blockquote>
