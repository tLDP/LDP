<title>Installation of Perl</title>

<para>Install Perl by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>./configure.gnu --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make install</userinput></screen></para>

<para>If you want more control over the way perl sets itself up to be
built, you can run the interactive <userinput>Configure</userinput> script
and modify the way perl is built. If you think you can live with the
(sensible) defaults perl auto-detects, then just use the commands listed
above.</para>
