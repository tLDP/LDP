<title>FHS compliance notes</title>

<para>There is a command installed in this package which is named test. It is 
often used in shell scripts to evaluate conditions, but is more often 
encountered in the form of <command>[ condition ]</command>. These brackets 
are built into the bash interpreter, but the FHS dictates that there should be a
<filename>[</filename> binary. We create that in this way, while still in the
<filename class="directory">/bin</filename> directory:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cd /bin &amp;&amp;
ln -sf test [</userinput></screen></para>
