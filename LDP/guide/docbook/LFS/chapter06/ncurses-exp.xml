<para><userinput>--with-shared:</userinput> This enables the build of the
shared ncurses library files.</para>

<para><userinput>--disable-termcap:</userinput> Disabled the compilation of
termcap fall back support.</para>

<para><userinput>cd /lib &amp;&amp; mv *.a /usr/lib :</userinput> This
moves all of the static ncurses library files from /lib to /usr/lib.
/lib should only contain the shared files which are essential to the
system when /usr may not be mounted.</para>

<para><userinput>chmod 755 *.5.2:</userinput> Shared libraries should be
executable.  Ncurses install routine doesn't set the permissions
properly so we do it manually instead.</para>

<para><userinput>ln -sf libncurses.a libcurses.a:</userinput> Some
programs try to link using -lcurses instead of -lncurses.  This symlink
ensures that such programs will link without errors.</para>

<para><userinput>ln -sf ../../lib/libncurses.so etc:</userinput> These
symlinks are created to tidy up the installation. It's good practise to
have the *.so files in /usr/lib as well as in /lib, to ensure that the
linker is always able to find the files whether it's looking in /lib or
/usr/lib.</para>
