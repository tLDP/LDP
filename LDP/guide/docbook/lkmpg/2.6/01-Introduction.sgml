<sect1><title>What Is A Kernel Module?</title>

	<para>So, you want to write a kernel module.  You know C, you've written a few normal programs to run as processes, and now
	you want to get to where the real action is, to where a single wild pointer can wipe out your file system and a core dump
	means a reboot.</para>

	<para>What exactly is a kernel module?  Modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon
	demand.  They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system.  For example, one type of module
	is the device driver, which allows the kernel to access hardware connected to the system.  Without modules, we would have to
	build monolithic kernels and add new functionality directly into the kernel image.  Besides having larger kernels, this has
	the disadvantage of requiring us to rebuild and reboot the kernel every time we want new functionality.</para>

<sect1><title>How Do Modules Get Into The Kernel?</title>

	<indexterm><primary>/proc/modules</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>kmod</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>kerneld</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary><filename>/etc/modules.conf</filename></primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary><filename>/etc/conf.modules</filename></primary></indexterm>

	<para>You can see what modules are already loaded into the kernel by running <command>lsmod</command>, which gets its
	information by reading the file <filename>/proc/modules</filename>.</para>

	<para>How do these modules find their way into the kernel?  When the kernel needs a feature that is not resident in the
	kernel, the kernel module daemon kmod<footnote><para>In earlier versions of linux, this was known as
	kerneld.</para></footnote> execs modprobe to load the module in.  modprobe is passed a string in one of two forms:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>A module name like <filename>softdog</filename> or <filename>ppp</filename>.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>A more generic identifier like <varname>char-major-10-30</varname>.</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>If modprobe is handed a generic identifier, it first looks for that string in the file
	<filename>/etc/modprobe.conf</filename>.<footnote><para>If such a file exists. Note that the acual behavoir might be
	distribution dependant.	If you're interested in the details,read the man pages that came with module-init-tools,
	and see for yourself what's really going on. You could use something like <command> strace modprobe dummy </command>
	to find out how dummy.ko gets loaded. FYI: The dummy.ko I'm talking about here is part of the mainline kernel
	and can be found in the networking section. It needs to be compiled as a module (and installed, of course) for this to
	work. </para></footnote>
	If it finds an alias line like:</para>
	
	<screen>
alias char-major-10-30 softdog
	</screen>

	<para>it knows that the generic identifier refers to the module <filename>softdog.ko</filename>.</para>

	<para>Next, modprobe looks through the file <filename>/lib/modules/version/modules.dep</filename>, to see if other modules
	must be loaded before the requested module may be loaded.  This file is created by <command>depmod -a</command> and 
	contains module dependencies. For example, <filename>msdos.ko</filename> requires the <filename>fat.ko</filename> module 
	to be already loaded into the kernel. The requested module has a dependancy on another module if the other module defines 
	symbols	(variables or functions) that the requested module uses.</para>

	<para>Lastly, modprobe uses insmod to first load any prerequisite modules into the kernel, and then the requested module.
	modprobe directs insmod to <filename role="directory">/lib/modules/version/</filename><footnote><para>If you are modifying
	the kernel, to avoid overwriting your existing modules you may want to use the <varname>EXTRAVERSION</varname> variable in 
	the kernel Makefile to create a seperate directory.</para></footnote>, the standard directory for modules.  insmod is 
	intended to be fairly dumb about the location of modules, whereas modprobe is aware of the default location of modules,
	knows how to figure out the dependancies and load the modules in the right order.
	So for example,	if you wanted to load the msdos module, you'd have to either run:</para>

	<screen>
insmod /lib/modules/2.6.11/kernel/fs/fat/fat.ko
insmod /lib/modules/2.6.11/kernel/fs/msdos/msdos.ko
	</screen>

	<para> or: </para>
	<screen>
modprobe msdos
	</screen>

	<para> What we've seen here is: <command> insmod </command> requires you to pass it full pathname and to insert the modules
	in the right order, while <command> modprobe </command> just takes the name, without any extension, and figures out
	all it needs to know by parsing <filename>/lib/modules/version/modules.dep</filename>.</para>
	
	<para>Linux distros provide modprobe, insmod and depmod as a package called module-init-tools. In previous versions
	that package was called modutils. Some distros also set up some wrappers that allow both packages to be installed
	parallel and do the right thing in order to be able to deal with 2.4 and 2.6 kernels. Users should not need to care
	about the details, as long as they're running recent versions of that tools.</para>

	<para>Now you know how modules get into the kernel.  There's a bit more to the story if you want to write your own modules
	which depend on other modules (we calling this `stacking modules').  But this will have to wait for a future chapter. 
	We have	a lot to cover before addressing this relatively high-level issue.</para>



		<sect2><title>Before We Begin</title>

			<para>Before we delve into code, there are a few issues we need to cover.  Everyone's system is different and everyone has
			their own groove.  Getting your first "hello world" program to compile and load correctly can sometimes be a trick.  Rest
			assured, after you get over the initial hurdle of doing it for the first time, it will be smooth sailing
			thereafter.</para>



				<sect3><title>Modversioning</title>

					<para>A module compiled for one kernel won't load if you boot a different kernel unless you enable
					<literal>CONFIG_MODVERSIONS</literal> in the kernel.  We won't go into module versioning until later in this guide.
					Until we cover modversions, the examples in the guide may not work if you're running a kernel with modversioning
					turned on.  However, most stock Linux distro kernels come with it turned on.  If you're having trouble loading the
					modules because of versioning errors, compile a kernel with modversioning turned off.</para>

				</sect3>



				<sect3 id="usingx"><title>Using X</title>

					<para>It is highly recommended that you type in, compile and load all the examples this guide discusses.  It's also
					highly recommended you do this from a console.  You should not be working on this stuff in X.</para>

					<para>Modules can't print to the screen like <function>printf()</function> can, but they can log information and
					warnings, which ends up being printed on your screen, but only on a console.  If you insmod a module from an xterm,
					the information and warnings will be logged, but only to your log files.  You won't see it unless you look through
					your log files.  To have immediate access to this information, do all your work from console.</para>

				</sect3>



				<sect3><title>Compiling Issues and Kernel Version</title>

					<para>Very often, Linux distros will distribute kernel source that has been patched in various non-standard ways,
					which may cause trouble.</para>

					<para>A more common problem is that some Linux distros distribute incomplete kernel headers.  You'll need to compile
					your code using various header files from the Linux kernel.  Murphy's Law states that the headers that are missing are
					exactly the ones that you'll need for your module work.</para>

					<para>To avoid these two problems, I highly recommend that you download, compile and boot into a fresh, stock Linux
					kernel which can be downloaded from any of the Linux kernel mirror sites.  See the Linux Kernel HOWTO for more
					details.</para>

					<para>Ironically, this can also cause a problem.  By default, gcc on your system may look for the kernel headers in
					their default location rather than where you installed the new copy of the kernel (usually in <filename
					role="directory">/usr/src/</filename>.  This can be fixed by using gcc's <literal>-I</literal> switch.</para>
