RADIUS
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
Remote Authentication Dial-In user Service. A standard for authentication and accounting, RADIUS is primarily used to control dial-up access to PPP and other services. The protocal was standardized in RFC 2058, the current implementation is defined in RFCs 2138 and 2139. RADIUS uses UDP packets, older servers use ports 1645 and 1646, the current standard is port 1812 for authentication and 1813 for accounting. From Linux Guide @FirstLinux

RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service)
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
RADIUS allows distributed &quot;modem pools&quot; to use the same authentication server. When a user dials-up to an ISPs, the username/password is transmitted across the Internet to the central RADIUS server. This allows an ISP to easily manage many dialin locations. Key point: Since its humble beginnings, RADIUS has spread to become a generic remote authentication service. For example, it is becoming the desired standard to fix IEEE 802.11 wireless authentication problems. random

RAID
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
A group of hard disks under the control of array management software that work together to improve performance and decrease the odds of losing data due to  mechanical or electronic failure by using such techniques as data striping. RAID implementations, because of their complexity and steep cost, are most often used on network servers. Several RAID levels exist, each with advantages and disadvantages.

RAID (Redundant Array of Independent/Inexpensive Disks/Devices)
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
A method of providing data redundancy, improved performance and/or quick data recoverability from disk crashes, by spreading or duplicating data across multiple disk drives. Commonly used RAID types include RAID 0 (Data Striping), RAID 1 (Disk Mirroring) and RAID 5 (Striping with Distributed Parity). RAID configurations typically require SCSI disk drives (not IDE/EIDE) and may require identical drives (same capacity, brand, etc.). RAID arrays appear to the operating system as a single device.

RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4, Arcfour, ARC4)
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
A symmetric stream cipher developed by RSA Data Security, Inc.. Whereas most ciphers have been optimized for hardware (e.g. DES), RC4 was optimized for software. Applications: SSL, which means RC4 is built into your Netscape and Microsoft web browser. CDPD (Cellular) connections for your Palm modem using OmniSky. Lotus Notes, MS Access, Adobe Acrobat, PPTP, Oracle Secure SQL. IEEE 802.11 WEP Key point: RC4 supports variable length keys (up to 2048-bits), but most uses are 40-bits due to historic export controls. History: The algorithm was a trade-secret until 1994 when somebody reverse engineered it and anonymously posted it to the cypherpunks list and USENET. This reverse engineered version is known as &quot;Arcfour&quot; or &quot;ARC4&quot;, which stands for &quot;Alleged RC4&quot;. It isn&apos;t patented. Therefore, RSA Inc. is trying to move all its customers to RC5, which is both patented and copyrighted. The source code is essentially: while (length--) { x++; sx = state[x]; y += sx; sy = state[y]; state[y] = sx; state[x] = sy; *data++ ^= state[(sx+sy)&amp;0xFF];} RSA Inc. still claims that it is a trade secret; however, due to its simplicity, its description is in virtually all crypto textbooks -- it is the most widely known secret on the net. Key point: RC4 works by XORing the plain-text against a stream of random numbers. Unless a whitening seed is provided at the begining, the plain-text may be recovered. This is a common bug in products. From Hacking-Lexicon

RCS
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
Overview of RCS. RCS, the revision control system, is a suite of programs that tracks changes in text files and controls shared access to files in work group situations. It is generally used to maintain source code modules. It lends itself to tracking revisions of document files as well. RCS was written by Walter F. Tichy and Paul Eggert. The latest version which has been ported to Linux is RCS Version 5.7. There is also a semi-official, threaded version available. Much of the information in this HOWTO is taken from the RCS man pages. RCS includes the rcs(1) program, which controls RCS archive file attributes, ci(1) and co(1), which check files in and out of RCS archives, ident(1), which searches RCS archives by keyword identifiers, rcsclean(1), a program to clean up files that are not being worked on or haven&apos;t changed, rcsdiff(1), which runs diff(1) to compare the revisions, rcsmerge(1), which merges two RCS branches into a single working file, and rlog(1), which prints RCS log messages. Files archived by RCS may be text of any format, or binary if the diff program used to generate change files handles 8-bit data. Files may optionally include identification strings to aid in tracking by ident(1). RCS uses the utilities diff(1) and diff3(3) to generate the change files between revisions. A RCS archive consists of the initial revision of a file, which is version 1.1, and a series of change files, one for each revision. Each time a file is checked out of an archive with co(1), edited, and checked back into the archive with ci(1), the version number is increased, for example, to 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and so on for successive revisions. The archives themselves commonly reside in a ./RCS subdirectory, although RCS has other options for archive storage. For an overview of RCS, see the rcsintro(1) manual page. From RCS-HOWTO

RFC
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
/R-F-C/ n. [Request For Comment] One of a long-established series of numbered Internet informational documents and standards widely followed by commercial software and freeware in the Internet and Unix communities. Perhaps the single most influential one has been RFC-822 (the Internet mail-format standard). The RFCs are unusual in that they are floated by technical experts acting on their own initiative and reviewed by the Internet at large, rather than formally promulgated through an institution such as ANSI. For this reason, they remain known as RFCs even once adopted as standards. The RFC tradition of pragmatic, experience-driven, after-the-fact standard writing done by individuals or small working groups has important advantages over the more formal, committee-driven process typical of ANSI or ISO. Emblematic of some of these advantages is the existence of a flourishing tradition of `joke&apos; RFCs; usually at least one a year is published, usually on April 1st. Well-known joke RFCs have included 527 (&quot;ARPAWOCKY&quot;, R. Merryman, UCSD; 22 June 1973), 748 (&quot;Telnet Randomly-Lose Option&quot;, Mark R. Crispin; 1 April 1978), and 1149 (&quot;A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers&quot;, D. Waitzman, BBN STC; 1 April 1990). The first was a Lewis Carroll pastiche; the second a parody of the TCP-IP documentation style, and the third a deadpan skewering of standards-document legalese, describing protocols for transmitting Internet data packets by carrier pigeon. The RFCs are most remarkable for how well they work -- they manage to have neither the ambiguities that are usually rife in informal specifications, nor the committee-perpetrated misfeatures that often haunt formal standards, and they define a network that has grown to truly worldwide proportions.

RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
A popular UNIX network protocol, RPC allows programs on one machine to make a &quot;procedure&quot; call on another machine. The upshot of this is that you could split a program in two halves, each part running on a separate machine. The procedure calls are invisibly mapped so that the programmer doesn&apos;t have to worry about the details. Contrast: The oldest form of RPC in use is Sun&apos;s RPC, upon which many famous protocols (such as NFS) are based. A newer form known as DCE RPC is used by Microsoft as the basis for its RPC services. The DCE version is dramatically more complex than the Sun variant, but supplies more services (such as built-in security). History: In the year 1999 (and early 2000), a wave of hacker attacks against Sun&apos;s RPC services swept the net. Virtually any Sun box connected to the net whose default RPC services were enabled, was hackable. Many Linux boxes were also hackable through RPC-based services. Virtually all of these attacks where through buffer overflow exploits. Example: Some RPC services are: portmapper Forms the core of the RPC system allowing a client to find servers. NFS This is the best known of all RPC services. Virtually all &quot;file servers&quot; use either Sun&apos;s NFS (in the UNIX world) or Microsoft&apos;s SMB (in the Windows world). Whenever one UNIX system is sharing a filesystem with another UNIX system, you can bet that they are using NFS. The name &quot;NFS&quot; means both the specific protocol called &quot;NFS&quot;, but also the entire suite of supporting protocols like &quot;mountd&quot;, &quot;statd&quot;, and &quot;lockd&quot;. rpc.mountd The &quot;mount&quot; sub-protocol of the NFS suite is used by a client to connect to the file service. It is named after the &quot;mount&quot; command in UNIX that is used to connect any filesystem into the main directory structure. This includes not only remote filesystems from NFS, but also floppy disks, CD-ROM drives, other partitions on the same hard-disk, or other hard-disks. Exploit: In 1998/1998 timeframe, a buffer-overflow in a Linux rpc.mountd implementation led to widespread compromises. See also: showmount rpc.statd Monitors the status of files; bugs in Linux and Solaris version have led to widespread exploits in 1998 through 2001. From Hacking-Lexicon

RSA
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
RSA is the name of the most prevalent public/private key algorithm. It is also the name of the company (RSA Security) that originally held the patent rights to this system. It was invented in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman. Details: In order to generate the keys: First, some random data is generated. Most of the successful attacks against RSA implementations have been against this step. Two large primes are randomly chosen. This can be a time consuming step as the computer randomly generates numbers and tests to see if they are prime. These two numbers are traditionally called p and q. The two numbers are multiplied together, n = pq. We will be publishing n as part of the public-key. The security of RSA lies in the fact that it is computationally too difficult to factor n back into p and q. (However, somebody may in the future discover a way to easily factor large numbers, in which case all of today&apos;s cryptography will be rendered useless in one fell swoop). A number e is chosen, where e is less than n and &quot;relatively prime&quot; (no common factors) to (p-1)(q-1). The public-key will consist of the pair (n,e). A number d is chosen, where (ed-1) is divisible by (p-1)(q-1). The private-key consists of the pair (n,d). Usually, the original prime numbers p and q are discarded after this step. The numbers n, e, and d are of interest because they serve as fields within digital certificates. Details: In order to encrypt/decrypt something using RSA, the following algorithm is used. Start with the original message called m. Note that in reality, we&apos;ve already encrypted the real message with a randomly generated symmetric key, and we really are just encrypting this key to send along with the encrypted message. Public-key cryptography is generally used for key-exchange because it is too slow for general-purpose encryption. Therefore, m is really just a small 128-bit key rather than the entire message. Create the ciphertext c using the equation c = me mod n, where (n,e) are the public-key. Send the ciphertext message c. Upon reception, use the equation m = cd mod n, where (n,d) is the private-key and m is the decrypted message. (Again, this is usually just the symmetric key that we will use to decrypt the actual message). Point: RSA forms the basis for X.509 certificates in web servers and browsers. Key point: RSA Security charges a hefty license to use the RSA algorithm. However, the patent expires in September of the year 2000. At that time, the number of products using the RSA algorithm are likely to explode. Key point: An alternative to RSA is the &quot;Diffie-Hellman&quot; algorithm. This is used in many cases, but it is hampered by the fact that many products that could use it (like Netscape and Microsoft browsers) do not; for interoperability you often need to use RSA over DH. History: When exporting RSA was illegal, a popular form of disobedience would be to wear T-shirts with the algorithm or us it as part of your .sig. #!/bin/perl -sp0777i&lt;X+d*lMLa^*lN%0]dsXx++lMlN/dsM0&lt;j]dsj $/=unpack(&apos;H*&apos;,$_);$_=`echo 16dio\U$k&quot;SK$/SM$n\EsN0p[lN*1lK[d2%Sa2/d0$^Ixp&quot;|dc`;s/\W//g;$_=pack(&apos;H*&apos;,/((..)*)$/) Applications: PGP, SSL, SET, DNSSEC, SSH See also: DSA From Hacking-Lexicon

RSA Reference Implementation. This was a fairly open implementation of the RSA algorithm that has been embedded into many problems. This is not the source code that RSA sells to vendors, but an open-source version that has been imbedded within freeware/open-source products (like ssh). A patent-license is still required when using this code in commercial products, though. Key point: RSAREF has been supported by RSA (the company) for a long time, and a number of security holes have been found in this implementation. RSA wants people to use the BSAFE development kit instead. In late 1999 in particular, a bug was found that allows ssh to be hacked. From Hacking-Lexicon

n. 1. Those institutions at which `programming&apos; may be used in the same sentence as `FORTRAN&apos;, `COBOL&apos;, `RPG&apos;, `IBM&apos;, `DBASE&apos;, etc. Places where programs do such commercially necessary but intellectually uninspiring things as generating payroll checks and invoices. 2. The location of non-programmers and activities not related to programming. 3. A bizarre dimension in which the standard dress is shirt and tie and in which a person&apos;s working hours are defined as 9 to 5 (see code grinder). 4. Anywhere outside a university. &quot;Poor fellow, he&apos;s left MIT and gone into the Real World.&quot; Used pejoratively by those not in residence there. In conversation, talking of someone who has entered the Real World is not unlike speaking of a deceased person. It is also noteworthy that on the campus of Cambridge University in England, there is a gaily-painted lamp-post which bears the label `REALITY CHECKPOINT&apos;. It marks the boundary between university and the Real World; check your notions of reality before passing. This joke is funnier because the Cambridge `campus&apos; is actually coextensive with the center of Cambridge town. See also fear and loathing, mundane, and uninteresting. From Jargon Dictionary

Regular Expressions
</glossterm>

<para>
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a template used to search for strings [Words, phrases, or just about any sequence of characters. ] within text. In other words, it is a search pattern. To get an idea of when you would need to do this, consider the example of having a list of names and telephone numbers. If you want to find a telephone number that contains a 3 in the second place and ends with an 8, regular expressions provide a way of doing that kind of search. Or consider the case where you would like to send an email to fifty people, replacing the word after the ``Dear&apos;&apos; with their own name to make the letter more personal. Regular expressions allow for this type of searching and replacing. From Rute-Users-Guide

Relative vs. Absolute Pathnames
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
Commands can be given file name arguments in two ways. If you are in the same directory as the file (i.e., the file is in the current directory), then you can just enter the file name on its own (e.g., cp my_file new_file). Otherwise, you can enter the full path name, like cp /home/jack/my_file /home/jack/new_file. Very often administrators use the notation ./my_file to be clear about the distinction, for instance, cp ./my_file ./new_file. The leading ./ makes it clear that both files are relative to the current directory. File names not starting with a / are called relative path names, and otherwise, absolute path names.

R is designed as a true computer language with control-flow constructions for iteration and alternation, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. For computationally intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. S is the statistician&apos;s Matlab and R is to S what Octave is to Matlab. This packages is a meta-package which eases the transition from the pre-1.5.0 package setup with its larger r-base package. Once installed, it can be safely removed and apt-get will automatically upgrade its components during future upgrades.  Providing this packages gives a way to users to then only install r-base-core (but not, say, r-base-latex) if they so desire. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

For older kernels, you can find patches at http://people.redhat.com/mingo/raid-patches/. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

adj. 1. Unpredictable (closest to mathematical definition); weird. &quot;The system&apos;s been behaving pretty randomly.&quot; 2. Assorted; undistinguished. &quot;Who was at the conference?&quot; &quot;Just a bunch of random business types.&quot; 3. (pejorative) Frivolous; unproductive; undirected. &quot;He&apos;s just a random loser.&quot; 4. Incoherent or inelegant; poorly chosen; not well organized. &quot;The program has a random set of misfeatures.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s a random name for that function.&quot; &quot;Well, all the names were chosen pretty randomly.&quot; 5. In no particular order, though deterministic. &quot;The I/O channels are in a pool, and when a file is opened one is chosen randomly.&quot; 6. Arbitrary. &quot;It generates a random name for the scratch file.&quot; 7. Gratuitously wrong, i.e., poorly done and for no good apparent reason. For example, a program that handles file name defaulting in a particularly useless way, or an assembler routine that could easily have been coded using only three registers, but redundantly uses seven for values with non-overlapping lifetimes, so that no one else can invoke it without first saving four extra registers. What randomness! 8. n. A random hacker; used particularly of high-school students who soak up computer time and generally get in the way. 9. n. Anyone who is not a hacker (or, sometimes, anyone not known to the hacker speaking); the noun form of sense 2. &quot;I went to the talk, but the audience was full of randoms asking bogus questions&quot;. 10. n. (occasional MIT usage) One who lives at Random Hall. See also J. Random, some random X. 11. [UK] Conversationally, a non sequitur or something similarly out-of-the-blue. As in: &quot;Stop being so random!&quot; This sense equates to `hatstand&apos;, taken from the Viz comic character &quot;Roger Irrelevant - He&apos;s completely Hatstand.&quot; From Jargon Dictionary

Ras was originally intended for transporting a large file split over several floppy disks in a manner resilient to the corruption of a few of the disks, and a pair of example shell scripts to do this (rassplit and rasmerge) is included in the distribution.

Unicast and multicast voice-over-IP application RAT is a network audio tool that allows users to participate in audio conferences over the Internet. These can be between two participants directly, or between a group of participants on a common multicast group. No special features are required to use RAT in point-to-point mode, but to use the multicast conferencing facilities of RAT, a connection to the Mbone, or a similar multicast capable network, is required. RAT is based on IETF standards, using RTP above UDP/IP as its transport protocol, and conforming to the RTP profile for audio and video conferences with minimal control.

spam-catcher using a collaborative filtering network Vipul&apos;s Razor is a distributed, collaborative, spam detection and filtering network. Razor establishes a distributed and constantly updating catalogue of spam in propagation. This catalogue is used by clients to filter out known spam. On receiving a spam, a Razor Reporting Agent (run by an end-user or a troll box) calculates and submits a 20-character unique identification of the spam (a SHA Digest) to its closest Razor Catalogue Server. The Catalogue Server echos this signature to other trusted servers after storing it in its database. Prior to manual processing or transport-level reception, Razor Filtering Agents (end-users and MTAs) check their incoming mail against a Catalogue Server and filter out or deny transport in case of a signature match. Catalogued spam, once identified and reported by a Reporting Agent, can be blocked out by the rest of the Filtering Agents on the network. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

Besides supporting all the basic Direct Connect commands such as downloading, searching, uploading, resuming, multihub search etc RCCP can be scripted. Selected scripts from many included with the package:  * multi hub spider search  * last seen user script (ala irc !seen script)  * list all files from all users  * download bot - watches query results and downloads all of them  * segmented downloading  * ... plus many more ... Direct Connect protocol is intended for peer-based file-sharing. In practise it works better than gnutella and other similar systems as it allows dc hubs (servers) administators to require clients to share specified amount of data. The amount is usually based on type of client&apos;s connection and it is used not to hurt or exclude anybody but to make file sharing &quot;fair play&quot;. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

Backup program to use deltas for history rdiff-backup is a script that backs up one directory to another.

The idea is to combine the best features of a mirror and an incremental backup. rdiff-backup also preserves subdirectories, symlinks, special files, permissions, uid/gid ownership (if it is running as root), and modification times. Finally, rdiff-backup can operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe, like rsync. Thus you can use rdiff-backup and ssh to securely back a hard drive up to a remote location, and only the differences will be transmitted. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

1. [techspeak] adj. Describes an application which requires a program to respond to stimuli within some small upper limit of response time (typically milli- or microseconds). Process control at a chemical plant is the canonical example. Such applications often require special operating systems (because everything else must take a back seat to response time) and speed-tuned hardware. 2. adv.

English text speech synthesizer Recite is a program to do speech synthesis.  The quality of sound produced is not terribly good, but it should be adequate for reporting the occasional error message verbally. Given some English text, recite will convert it to a series of phonemes, then convert the phonemes to a sequence of vocal tract parameters, and then synthesise the sound a vocal tract would make to say the sentence. Recite can perform a subset of these operations, so it can be used to convert text into phonemes, or to produce an utterance based on vocal tract parameters computed by some other program.

Undelete files on ext2 partitions Recover automates some steps as described in the ext2-undeletion howto. This means it seeks all the deleted inodes on your hard drive with debugfs. When all the inodes are indexed, recover asks you some questions about the deleted file. These questions are:   * Hard disk device name   * Year of deletion   * Month of deletion   * Weekday of deletion   * First/Last possible day of month   * Min/Max possible file size   * Min/Max possible deletion hour   * Min/Max possible deletion minute   * User ID of the deleted file   * A text string the file included (can be ignored) If recover found any fitting inodes, it asks to give a directory name and dumps the inodes into the directory. Finally it asks you if you want to filter the inodes again (in case you typed some wrong answers). From Debian 3.0r0 APT

register dancing
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
n. Many older processor architectures suffer from a serious shortage of general-purpose registers. This is especially a problem for compiler-writers, because their generated code needs places to store temporaries for things like intermediate values in expression evaluation. Some designs with this problem, like the Intel 80x86, do have a handful of special-purpose registers that can be pressed into service, providing suitable care is taken to avoid unpleasant side effects on the state of the processor: while the special-purpose register is being used to hold an intermediate value, a delicate minuet is required in which the previous value of the register is saved and then restored just before the official function (and value) of the special-purpose register is again needed.

relay (mail relay)
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
E-mail relay is where spammers hijack an e-mail server in order to forward their spam through the server. Usually, the spammer (from the Internet) sends the e-mail server a single e-mail with thousands of recipients. Similarly, any open USENET server can be hijacked to relay spam to newsgroups. Key point: This allows a spammer with a dial-up account to send e-mail as fast as a high-speed Internet connection, since it is the victim who breaks apart the recipient list and sends each person a separate copy. Therefore, one e-mail goes into the server, thousands come out. Key point: Relaying can be turned off in the e-mail server configuration. Such configuration will force the server to accept either incoming mail, or outgoing mail, but not incoming e-mail destined back out to the Internet. There are several sites on the Internet that will scan your corporate e-mail server to see if will relay spam. Key point: Some e-mail relays are completely open, others are closed to open relaying, but have bugs that can be exploited in order to relay spam.

Emacs mode to help find relevant texts The Remembrance Agent is one of the projects being developed by the MIT Media Lab&apos;s software agents group.  Given a collection of the user&apos;s accumulated email, usenet news articles, papers, saved HTML files and other text notes, it attempts to find those documents which are most relevant to the user&apos;s current context.  That is, it searches this collection of text for the documents which bear the highest word-for-word similarity to the text the user is currently editing, in the hope that they will also bear high conceptual similarity and thus be useful to the user&apos;s current work. These suggestions are continuously displayed in a small buffer at the bottom of the user&apos;s emacs buffer.  If a suggestion looks useful, the full text can be retrieved with a single command.

remote (remote attack, remote exploit)
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
A common way to classify attacks is whether they are done remotely by a hacker from across the Internet, or whether they are done locally by a user who already has privileges on the system. The important difference is that a &quot;remote&quot; attack can be launched by any of the hundreds of the of millions of people on the Internet at any time without first logging on. Point: A hacker may need to use a combination of remote and local exploits in order to gain control over a system. More and more services are running within sandboxes in order to limit the &quot;spread of the infection&quot;. A local exploit may be needed in order to break out of the sandbox. Key point: The most common remote exploits are buffer overflow and other unchecked input attacks. They are either done against public services (such as HTTP and FTP) or during the logon of protected services (such as POP and IMAP). From Hacking-Lexicon

The general populace uses the word virus to apply to any hostile program a hacker might use. Normally, being a purist using the correct word is futile, but in this case the distinction is important. You catch viruses accidentally, and the virus rarely does anything hostile to your system. Conversely, when a hacker attempts to infect your system with a remote administration trojan, the hacker is attacking you personally. Key point: Infections by remote administration Trojans on Windows machines are becoming as frequent as viruses. One common vector is through File and Print Sharing, when home users inadvertently open up their system to the rest of the world. If a hacker has access to the hard-drive, he/she can place the trojan in a location known as the startup folder. This will run the trojan the next time the user logs in. Another common vector is when the hacker simply e-mails the trojan to the user along with a social engineering hack that convinces the user to run it against their better judgment.

Rename attachments on the fly. Renattach is a small, efficient and surprisingly effective filter designed primarily to offer an additional level of safety to Windows users whose e-mails pass through a UNIX-like mail server. Many modern viruses are spread through e-mail, and renattach combats such viruses by filtering e-mail attachments based on file extension. In version 1.1.1, the MIME type is also renamed. The idea is to rename potentially dangerous attachments (executable ones) so that the user, or the user&apos;s poorly written e-mail software, does not accidentally execute the attachment.

replay
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
A replay attack is a type of sniffer attack where the traffic is captured then retransmitted back at a computer. Analogy: In the 1992 movie Sneakers, the victim uses a voice identification system. Therefore, the heroes record the voice of one of the victim&apos;s employees, edit it with a computer, then play it back into the voice recognition system. Key point: It seems the first generation of any security architecture is vulnerable to replay attacks. For example, IPsec was original vulnerable to some replay attacks, even though it had provisions against the most obvious ones. Key point: The anti-replay remedy is to include a timestamp with a message. This then implies that everyone needs to have their clocks synchronized in order to communicate correctly.

reverse engineering
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
A technique whereby the hacker attempts to discover secrets about a program. Some reverse engineering techniques are: strings Dumps all the human-readable strings within a program. In 1999, hackers looked for &quot;strings&quot; within Microsoft&apos;s products and found something labeled NSA_KEY. This led the paranoid delusion that the NSA had somehow convinced Microsoft to put a backdoor key into the system. Similarly, early in year 2000, hackers discovered strings like GetPrivateProfileString in the BlackICE Defender personal firewall and made paranoid assumptions (in reality, GetPrivateProfileString is a standard Win32 function). The most commonly used tool for this is the program strings included with UNIX. disassemble Takes the compiled output of a program and retrieves the original assembly language mnemonics, which are easier for humans to read. For example, the byte &quot;0x90&quot; might be converted back into NOOP (no operation) instruction. An example of using this technique to discover code being sent across the wire is at http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/aol-exploit. The problem with disassembly is that it only makes the object files slightly more readable -- it doesn&apos;t reconstruct the full original source code or comments. decompile Decompilation produces high-level source code from an executable. The technique has proven essentially worthless for languages like C/C++, but works well on languages like Java, VisualBasic, and Delphi. It still doesn&apos;t obtain the original comments, however. Reverse engineering is often used to: anti-virus Discover how viruses work in order to write more effective signatures against them. cracking serialz Figuring out how copy protection works in order to break it.

On UNIX, the &quot;rhosts&quot; mechanism allows one system to trust another system. This means that if a user logs onto one UNIX system, they can further log onto any other system that trusts it. Only certain programs will use this file: rsh Tells the system to open a remote &quot;shell&quot; and run the specified program. rlogin Creates an interactive Telnet session on the other computer. Key point: A common backdoor is to place the entry &quot;+ +&quot; in the rhosts file. This tells the system to trust everybody. Key point: The file simply contains a list of named hosts or IP addresses. Sometime the hacker can forge DNS information in order to convince the victim that he has the same name as a trusted system. Alternately, a hacker can sometimes spoof the IP address of a trusted system. See also: hosts.equiv From Hacking-Lexicon

<glossdef>
<para>
A program documentation tool. The idea is to include for every function or procedure a standard header containing all sorts of information about the procedure or function. ROBODoc extracts these headers from the source file and puts them in a separate autodocs-file.  ROBODoc thus allows you to include the program documentation in the source code and avoid having to maintain two separate documents.  Or as Petteri puts it: &quot;robodoc is very useful - especially for programmers who don&apos;t like writing documents with Word or some other strange tool.&quot; ROBODoc can format the headers in a number of different formats: HTML, ASCII, AmigaGuide, LaTeX, or RTF. In HTML mode it can generate cross links between headers. You can even include parts of your source code. ROBODoc works with many programming languages: For instance C, Pascal, Shell Scripts, Assembler, COBOL, Occam, Postscript, Forth, Tcl/Tk, C++, Java -- basically any program in which you can use remarks/comments.

Zen Simulation of robot finding kitten In this simulation, you play the part of robot. Your task is to complete the simulation by finding kitten, as is your destiny, and indeed your wont.  You (robot) are represented by the # character, and you move around with the arrow keys touching things.  If the thing you touch is kitten, you get a cute little animation (which was cuter in the DOS version) and the simulation ends. Otherwise, you get a brief description of what it is you touched.

Make network sockets reliable in a transparent way Rocks protect sockets-based applications from network failures, particularly failures common to mobile computing, including:  - Link failures (e.g., unexpected modem disconnection);  - IP address changes (e.g., laptop movement, DHCP lease expiry);  - Extended periods of disconnection (e.g., laptop suspension). Rock-enabled programs continue to run after any of these events; their broken connections recover automatically, without loss of in-flight data, when connectivity returns. Rocks work transparently with most applications, including SSH clients, X window applications, and network service daemons. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

rootkit
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
The name for a kit of hacker utilities placed on a UNIX machine after a successful compromise. A typical rootkit includes: password sniffer log cleaners replacement binaries for common programs on the system (e.g. inetd) backdoor programs replacements to programs like ls and find so that they will not reveal the presence of the rootkit files. Key point: A rootkit contains many trojaned programs. These programs are used to allow the hacker entry back into the system and to hide the presence of the hacker. For example, a trojaned &quot;ps&quot; command might hide the hacker&apos;s sniffer daemon from appearing in the process list. Alternatively, the hacker might trojan an existing daemon like inetd to run a background sniffer. Key point: The most important trojaned programs are those that deal with gaining access back into the system with a special password. Therefore, trojaned versions of login daemon, su, or telnetd are needed. Key point: Rootkits often contain setuid programs that normal users can run in order to elevate their privileges to root. Look for these in order to see if your system has been hacked. Culture: Also called &quot;daemon kits&quot;. Example: The &quot;t0rn&quot; kit, including utilities like &quot;t0rnsniff&quot; and replacement binaries. In 2001, this kit was included as part of several Linux worms. From Hacking-Lexicon

rootstrap

<glossdef>
<para>
A tool for building complete Linux filesystem images Rootstrap was originally written to provide a facility for building filesystems for use with User-mode Linux, but can be useful in other applications as well. It uses a modular set of shell scripts to create the filesystem image, install a base system, and customize it for a particular application.  Currently, it only builds Debian systems, but the architecture is such that other base systems could be used instead. Use of rootstrap does not require root access, or special privileges of any kind.  This is because it builds the filesystem inside a User-mode Linux system running under an unprivileged uid. Filesystem creation with rootstrap is quick and painless.  With a local mirror and a single command, a fresh Debian woody filesystem can be created in about 3 minutes on relatively modest hardware.

It is used to enclose the text in a sealed wrapper that the reader must choose to open -- e.g., for posting things that might offend some readers, or spoilers. A major advantage of rot13 over rot(N) for other N is that it is self-inverse, so the same code can be used for encoding and decoding.

rproxy
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
A cache which uses differences to speed up retrievals rproxy stores hashed values of retrieved pages and when you next access the same page it computes the difference between the current page and the recently stored page. The rproxy extensions to HTTP allow the server to generate a hsync relative to the cached instance in a way that is completely general, and transparent to both the server and user agent. rproxy, and clients and servers which implement hsync, calculate a block-by-block signature of the file, by computing a checksum over consecutive extents of equal length, such as 1024 bytes. This checksum is then added into a header of the request and transmited as usual. To be useful, there should be at least two rproxy instances between the client and the server. Transfers between the proxies will be delta-encoded, while the browser and server will just see standard HTTP. For example, it is very useful to run on instance on each side of a modem link, so that data across the slow link will be delta-encoded.

Rxvt is a color VT102 terminal emulator for the X Window System. Rxvt is intended to be an xterm replacement for users who don&apos;t need the more esoteric features of xterm, like Tektronix 4014 emulation, session logging and toolkit style configurability. Since it doesn&apos;t support those features, rxvt uses much less swap space than xterm uses. This is a significant advantage on a machine which is serving a large number of X sessions. The rxvt package should be installed on any machine which serves a large number of X sessions, if you&apos;d like to improve that machine&apos;s performance. This version of rxvt can display Japanese, Chinese (Big5 and GuoBiao) and Korean. From Mandrake 9.0 RPM
