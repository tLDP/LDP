                      SOME SCRIPTS WILL NOT RUN


Note that the source code for a few of the example shell scripts,

ex57.sh
ex70.sh
ex71.sh
ex71a.sh
ex71b.sh
encryptedpw.sh
pw.sh
du.sh
rnd.sh
logevents.sh
rot13.sh
read-r.sh

have the "&lt;" and "&gt;" in place of angle brackets (< and >). This
is necessary for the Docbook SGML conversion. If you plan to run these
scripts from the enclosed source files, then it will, of course, be
necessary to restore the angle brackets.

                          &lt;      becomes  <
                          &gt;      becomes  >
                          &lt;&lt;  becomes  <<
                          &gt;&gt;  becomes  >>
