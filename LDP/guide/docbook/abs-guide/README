                      SOME SCRIPTS WILL NOT RUN


Note that the source code for a few of the example shell scripts,

du.sh
encryptedpw.sh
ex57.sh
ex70.sh
ex71.sh
ex71a.sh
ex71b.sh
logevents.sh
m4.sh
pw.sh
read-r.sh
rnd.sh
rot13.sh
here-function.sh
directory-info.sh (lines 273 and 353)
bashrc (comments on lines 596 and 618)

have the "&lt;" and "&gt;" in place of angle brackets (< and >), or &amp; in
place of the ampersand (&). This is necessary for the Docbook SGML
conversion. If you plan to run these scripts from the enclosed source
files, then it will, of course, be necessary to restore the angle
brackets or ampersand.

                          &lt;      becomes  <
                          &gt;      becomes  >
                          &lt;&lt;  becomes  <<
                          &gt;&gt;  becomes  >>
			  &amp;     becomes  &
