#  Warning:
#  -------
#  This is a fairly dangerous script.
#  Running it carelessly (especially as root)
#+ can cause data loss and other undesirable effects.

# Notes:
# -i is the "replace strings" option to xargs.
# The curly brackets are the placeholder for the replacement.
# 2&amp;>/dev/null suppresses unwanted error messages.

# Can  grep "$PROCESS_NAME" be replaced by pidof "$PROCESS_NAME"?

#  The "killall" command has the same effect as this script,
