  10.2.  RAID

  RAID, short for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks, is a method
  whereby information is spread across several disks, using techniques
  such as disk striping (RAID Level 0) and disk mirroring (RAID level 1)
  to achieve redundancy, lower latency and/or higher bandwidth for
  reading and/or writing, and recoverability from hard-disk crashes.
  Over six different types of RAID configurations have been defined.
  There are three types of RAID solution options available to Linux
  users: software RAID, outboard DASD boxes, and RAID disk controllers.


    Software RAID: Pure software RAID implements the various RAID
     levels in the kernel disk (block device) code.

    Outboard DASD Solutions: DASD (Direct Access Storage Device) are
     separate boxes that come with their own power supply, provide a
     cabinet/chassis for holding the hard drives, and appear to Linux as
     just another SCSI device. In many ways, these offer the most robust
     RAID solution.

    RAID Disk Controllers: Disk Controllers are adapter cards that plug
     into the ISA/EISA/PCI bus. Just like regular disk controller cards,
     a cable attaches them to the disk drives. Unlike regular disk
     controllers, the RAID controllers will implement RAID on the card
     itself, performing all necessary operations to provide various RAID
     levels.
