<para>
ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode), is a high speed packet switching format
that supports up to 622 Mbps. ATM can be used with T1 and T3 lines, FDDI,
and SONET OC1 and OC3 lines. ATM uses a technology called cell switching.
Data is sent in 53-byte packets called cells. Because packets are small and
uniform in size, they can be quickly routed by hardware switches. ATM uses
a virtual circuit between connection points for high reliability over
high-speed links.
