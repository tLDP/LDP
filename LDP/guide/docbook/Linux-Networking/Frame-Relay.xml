<title>Frame-Relay</title>

<para>
Frame relay is a protocol used with leased lines to support speeds up to
1.544 Mbps. Frame realy uses packet switching over a phone company's
network. Frame realy connections use a virtual circuit, called
a PVC (private virtual circuit), to establish connections. Once established,
connections use a low overhead and do not provide error correction.
</para>

<para>
A frame realy compatible router is used to attach the LAN to the frame
relay line. Frame relay lines are available in speeds ranging from 56 Kbps
to 1.544 Mbps, and varying proportionally in cost. One advantage of frame
relay is that bandwidth is available on demand: you can install a line
at 56 Kbps and later upgrade it to a higher speed by ordering the service
from the carrier, usually without replacing any equipment.
</para>

<para>
It was specifically designed and is well suited to data communications traffic
that is of a `bursty' or intermittent nature. You connect to a Frame Relay
network using a Frame Relay Access Device (FRAD).  The Linux Frame Relay
supports IP over Frame Relay as described in RFC-1490.
</para>

<para>
The Frame Relay device names are `dlci00', `dlci01' etc for the DLCI
encapsulation devices and `sdla0', `sdla1' etc for the FRAD(s).

</para>

<para>
Mike McLagan, mike.mclagan@linux.org, developed the Frame Relay
support and configuration tools.
</para>

<para>
Currently the only FRAD supported are the Sangoma Technologies S502A,
S502E and S508.
</para>

<para>
To configure the FRAD and DLCI devices after you have rebuilt your
kernel you will need the Frame Relay configuration tools. These are
available from ftp.invlogic.com.  Compiling and installing the tools
is straightforward, but the lack of a top level Makefile makes it a
fairly manual process:
</para>

<para>
<screen>  
  user% tar xvfz .../frad-0.15.tgz
  user% cd frad-0.15
  user% for i in common dlci frad; make -C $i clean; make -C $i; done
  root# mkdir /etc/frad
  root# install -m 644 -o root -g root bin/*.sfm /etc/frad
  root# install -m 700 -o root -g root frad/fradcfg /sbin
  root# install -m 700 -o root -g root dlci/dlcicfg /sbin
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Note that the previous commands use sh syntax, if you use a csh
flavour instead (like tcsh), the for loop will look different.
</para>

<para>
After installing the tools you need to create an /etc/frad/router.conf
file. You can use this template, which is a modified version of one of
the example files:
</para>
  
<para>
<screen>
  # /etc/frad/router.conf
  # This is a template configuration for frame relay.
  # All tags are included. The default values are based on the code
  # supplied with the DOS drivers for the Sangoma S502A card.
  #
  # A '#' anywhere in a line constitutes a comment
  # Blanks are ignored (you can indent with tabs too)
  # Unknown [] entries and unknown keys are ignored

When you've built your /etc/frad/router.conf file the only step
remaining is to configure the actual devices themselves. This is only
a little trickier than a normal network device configuration, you need
to remember to bring up the FRAD device before the DLCI encapsulation
devices. These commands are best hosted in a shell script, due to
their number:
