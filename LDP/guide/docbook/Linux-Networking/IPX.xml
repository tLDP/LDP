<para>
IPX and SPX are proprietary protocols that were developed during the
early 1980s by Novell for use in NetWare networks.

NetWare became the de facto standard network operating system (NOS) of
first generation LANs. Novell complemented its NOS with a
business-oriented application suite and client-side connection utilities.

They were based on protocols used in Xerox's XNS (Xerox Network Systems)
network architecture. 

IPX (Internetwork Packet Exchange) is a connectionless protocol that works
at the network layer of the OSI model, and SPX (Sequenced Packet Exchange)
is a connection-orientated protocol that works at the transport layer.

These protocols are often easier to configure than TCP/IP and are routable,
so they make a good alternative for some networks, particularly small
peer-to-peer networks. However, TCP/IP is more suitable for larger
LANs and WANs.

Frame types are one aspect of IPX networks that sometimes does require
configuration. The frame type determines the order and type of data included
in the packet. Typical frame types used in NetWare networks
802.2 and 802.3.

<para>
  Linux has a very clean IPX/SPX implementation, allowing it to be
  configured as an:

    IPX router
    IPX bridge
    NCP client and/or NCP Server (for sharing files)
    Novell Print Client, Novell Print Server

     And to:

    Enable PPP/IPX, allowing a Linux box to act as a PPP server/client
    Perform IPX tunnelling through IP, allowing the connection of two
     IPX networks through an IP only link
