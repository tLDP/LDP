  6.6.  IP Firewall (for Linux-2.0)

  IP Firewall and Firewalling issues are covered in more depth in the
  Firewall-HOWTO. IP Firewalling allows you to secure your machine
  against unauthorized network access by filtering or allowing datagrams
  from or to IP addresses that you nominate. There are three different
  classes of rules, incoming filtering, outgoing filtering and
  forwarding filtering. Incoming rules are applied to datagrams that are
  received by a network device. Outgoing rules are applied to datagrams
  that are to be transmitted by a network device. Forwarding rules are
  applied to datagrams that are received and are not for this machine,
  ie datagrams that would be routed.

  Kernel Compile Options:


               Networking options  --->
                   [*] Network firewalls
                   ....
                   [*] IP: forwarding/gatewaying
                   ....
                   [*] IP: firewalling
                   [ ] IP: firewall packet logging



  Configuration of the IP firewall rules is performed using the ipfwadm
  command. As I mentioned earlier, security is not something I am expert
  at, so while I will present an example you can use, you should do your
  own research and develop your own rules if security is important to
  you.

  Probably the most common use of IP firewall is when you are using your
  linux machine as a router and firewall gateway to protect your local
  network from unauthorized access from outside your network.


  The following configuration is based on a contribution from Arnt
  Gulbrandsen, <agulbra@troll.no>.

  The example describes the configuration of the firewall rules on the
  Linux firewall/router machine illustrated in this diagram:



       -                                   -
        \                                  | 172.16.37.0
         \                                 |   /255.255.255.0
          \                 ---------      |
           |  172.16.174.30 | Linux |      |
       NET =================|  f/w  |------|    ..37.19
           |    PPP         | router|      |  --------
          /                 ---------      |--| Mail |
         /                                 |  | /DNS |
        /                                  |  --------
       -                                   -



  The following commands would normally be placed in an rc file so that
  they were automatically started each time the system boots. For
  maximum security they would be performed after the network interfaces
  are configured, but before the interfaces are actually brought up to
  prevent anyone gaining access while the firewall machine is rebooting.

          # deny most other incoming TCP connections and log them
          # (append 1:1023 if you have problems with ftp not working)

          /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a deny -o -y -P tcp -S 0/0 -D 172.16.37.0/24

          # ... for UDP too

          /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a deny -o -P udp -S 0/0 -D 172.16.37.0/24



  Good firewall configurations are a little tricky. This example should
  be a reasonable starting point for you. The ipfwadm manual page offers
  some assistance in how to use the tool. If you intend to configure a
  firewall, be sure to ask around and get as much advice from sources
  you consider reliable and get someone to test/sanity check your
  configuration from the outside.

  6.7.  IP Firewall (for Linux-2.2)

  The new firewalling code is accessed via ``IP Firewall Chains''.  See
  the IP chanins home page for more information.  Among other things,
  you'll now need to use ipchains instead of ipfwadm to configure your
  filters. (From Documentation/Changes in the latest kernel sources).

  We are aware that this is a sorely out of date statement and we are
  currently working on getting this section more current. You can expect
  a newer version in August of 1999.

	
  8.7.  Firewall

  A firewall is a device that protects a private network from the public
  part (the internet as a whole). It is designed to control the flow of
  packets based on the source, destination, port and packet type
  information contained in each packet.

  Different firewall toolkits exist for Linux as well as built-in
  support in the kernel. Other firewalls are TIS and SOCKS. These
  firewall toolkits are very complete and combined with other tools
  allow blocking/redirection of all kinds of traffic and protocols.
  Different policies can be implemented via configuration files or GUI
  programs.

  ·  SOCKS <http://www.socks.nec.com/socksfaq.html>

  ·  Firewall HOWTO <http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Firewall-
     HOWTO.html>


  8.8.  Port forwarding

  An increasing number of web sites are becoming interactive by having
  cgi-bins or Java applets that access some database or other service.
  Since this access may pose a security problem, the machine containing
  the database should not be directly connected to the Internet.

  Port Forwarding can provide an almost ideal solution to this access
  problem. On the firewall, IP packets that come in to a specific port
  number can be re-written and forwarded to the internal server
  providing the actual service. The reply packets from the internal
  server are re-written to make it appear that they came from the
  firewall.

  Port forwarding information may be found here
  <http://www.ox.compsoc.net/~steve/portforwarding.html>
	
  8.3.  IP Masquerade

  IP Masquerade is a developing networking function in Linux. If a Linux
  host is connected to the Internet with IP Masquerade enabled, then
  computers connecting to it (either on the same LAN or connected with
  modems) can reach the Internet as well, even though they have no
  officially assigned IP addresses. This allows for reduction of costs,
  since many people may be able to access the Internet using a single
  modem connection as well as contributes to increased security (in some
  way the machine is acting as a firewall, since unofficially assigned
  addresses cannot be accessed outside of that network).

This is NOT a replacement for the IP-Masquerading HOWTO - it is to complement
it, and the two should be read side by side. I do not include things in here
that are covered by the the other HOWTO, nor do I explain what it all means,
or what it is all about. See [http://ipmasq.cjb.net] http://ipmasq.cjb.net
and the standard Masq-HOWTO for a much better guides.

This document describes how to enable the Linux IP Masquerade feature on a
given Linux host. IP Masq is a form of Network Address Translation or NAT
that allows internally networked computers that do not have one or more
registered Internet IP addresses to have the ability to communicate to the
Internet via your Linux boxes single Internet IP address.

1. Introduction

This is intentionally short and to the point.

If you have a network, that you want to attach to the outside:

[network]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Summary: (I like doing summaries first)

Assuming external internet card is eth0, and external IP is 123.12.23.43 and
the internal network card is eth1, then:
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|$> modprobe ipt_MASQUERADE # If this fails, try continuing anyway          |
|$> iptables -F; iptables -t nat -F; iptables -t mangle -F                  |
|$> iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j SNAT --to 123.12.23.43        |
|$> echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward                                  |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Or for a dial-up connection:
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|$> modprobe ipt_MASQUERADE # If this fails, try continuing anyway          |
|$> iptables -F; iptables -t nat -F; iptables -t mangle -F                  |
|$> iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE                    |
|$> echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward                                  |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Then to secure it:
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|$> iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT        |
|$> iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -i ! eth0 -j ACCEPT              |
|$> iptables -P INPUT DROP   #only if the first two are succesful           |
|$> iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth0 -j REJECT                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Or for a dial-up connection (with eth0 as the internal network card):
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|$> iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT        |
|$> iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -i ! ppp0 -j ACCEPT              |
|$> iptables -P INPUT DROP   #only if the first two are succesful           |
|$> iptables -A FORWARD -i ppp0 -o ppp0 -j REJECT                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

And thats it! To view the rules do "iptables -t nat -L"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Bitmore indepth version

Compiling the kernel: (Use a 2.4.x kernel or greater)

You need the following support in the kernel:

  * Under Networking Options
   
      + Network packet filtering (CONFIG_NETFILTER)
       
   
  * Under Networking Options->Netfilter Configuration
   
      + Connection tracking (CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK)
       
      + FTP Protocol support (CONFIG_IP_NF_FTP)
       
      + IP tables support (CONFIG_IP_NF_IPTABLES)
       
      + Connection state match support (CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_STATE)
       
      + Packet filtering (CONFIG_IP_NF_FILTER)
       
          o REJECT target support (CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_REJECT)
           
       
      + Full NAT (CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT)
       
          o MASQUERADE target support (CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_MASQUERADE)
           
          o REDIRECT target support (CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_REDIRECT)
           
       
      + Packet mangling (CONFIG_IP_NF_MANGLE)
       
      + LOG target support (CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_LOG)
       
   

First, if the iptable and masq modules are not compiled into the kernel and
not installed, but do exist as modules, we need to install them. If you
insmod ipt_MASQUERADE it will load ip_tables, ip_conntrack and iptable_nat.
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|$> modprobe ipt_MASQERADE                                                  |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Now either your Intranet is large, or you're just trying to get two or three
machines to work on the internet - it doesn't make much difference either
way.

Okay, I'm assuming that you have no other rules, so do:
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|$> iptables -F; iptables -t nat -F; iptables -t mangle -F                  |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

If you get an error saying can't find iptables, go find it and install it. If
it says no such table 'nat', recompile the kernel with nat support. If it
says no such table as 'mangle', don't worry about it, it's not necessary for
MASQ'ing. If it says iptables is incompatible with your kernel, go get > 2.4
and compile that with iptables support.

Then if you have a static ip do (e.g. network card not using DHCP):
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|$> iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j SNAT --to 123.12.23.43        |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

or for dynamic (e.g. a modem - you have to call a number first):
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|$> iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE                    |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Then finally to tell the kernel yes, you really do want to start forwarding
packets: (This only needs to be done once per reboot - but dosen't hurt to do
it lots)
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|$> echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward                                  |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Once you have checked this all works (See under Post-install) only allow
masquerading from the internal network - you don't want to allow people on
the internet to use it after all :)

First, allow any existing connections, or anything related (e.g. ftp server
connecting back to you)
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|$> iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT        |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

If this gives an error, then you most likely don't have state tracking in the
kernel - go recompile. Then allow new connections only from our intranet
(local/internal network). Replace the ppp0 with eth0 or whatever your 
external device is. (The ! means anything but)
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|$> iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -i ! ppp0 -j ACCEPT              |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

And now deny everything else:
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|$> iptables -P INPUT DROP   #only if the first two are succesful           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

If either of the first two rules failed, then this last rule with prevent the
masquerading from working at all. To undo this rule do "iptables -P INPUT
ACCEPT".
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Post-install Instructions

And it should all work now. Don't forget to:

  * Setup all the clients on the internal network to point to the Linux
    internal IP address as their gateway. (In windows right-click network
    neighbourhood->properties->gateway then change it to the Linux gateway
    internal ip.)
   
  * Setup all the clients to use your ISP's HTTP proxy if they have one, use
    a transparent proxy (WARNING - I've heard reports of transparent proxying
    to be very slow on very big networks), or run squid on your new linux
    gateway. (This is optional, but preferrable for large networks)
   
  * Be sure to specify a DNS when setting up your clients. Otherwise you will
    get errors on the clients saying 'cannot resolve address' etc. If DNS
    used to work (URL address worked) but doesn't after you setup
    Masquerading, this is because your ISP's/network's DHCP server can no
    longer tell you what the DNS address is.
   
    [Offtopic] I wonder if you could simply send out a dhcp broadcast that
    just forwards on the dns server (and http_proxy while you're at it)
    without having to setup a dhcp server (or even if you do). Can someone
    mail me about this? :)
   
    Thanks to Richard Atcheson for pointing this out.
   
  * Now you should start securing it! First turn off forwarding in general: "
    iptables -P FORWARD DROP", and then learn how to use iptables and /etc/
    hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny to secure your system. WARNING - Don't
    try this mentioned iptables rule until you have the masquerading working.
    You have to explicitely allow every packet through that you want if you
    are going to set the last rule to be DENY. (Undo with "iptables -P
    FORWARD ACCEPT")
   
  * Allow through any services you do want the internet to see.
   
    For an example, to allow access to your web server do:
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |$> iptables -A INPUT --protocol tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT       |
    |$> iptables -A INPUT --protocol tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT      |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   
    To allow ident (For connecting to irc etc) do
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |$> iptables -A INPUT --protocol tcp --dport 113 -j ACCEPT      |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   

To test it:

  * Try connecting from a client to the web using an IP. Google's IP is
    216.239.33.100 (well that's one of them) and you should be able to get a
    reply from that. e.g. "ping 216.239.33.100" "lynx 216.239.33.100".
   
  * Try a full out connection by name. e.g. "ping google.com" "lynx
    google.com" or from Internet Explorer / netscape.
   

Where eth0 is the external Internet card, and 123.12.23.43 is the external ip
of that machine.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. FAQ's - Frequently Asked Compla^H^H^H^H^H^H Questions

  * How do I list the rules I've got so far?
   
    - Try
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |$> iptables -L                                                 |
    |$> iptables -t nat -L                                          |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   
  * It won't resolve IP's! I'm typing 'www.microsoft.com' in and it says it
    can't find it!
   
    - Make sure you add the dns server ip to all the clients.
   
  * It don't work! It doesn't like iptables / NAT / SNAT / MASQ
   
    - Go get the latest kernel, and compile with iptables and full NAT
    support.
   
  * It don't work! The masquerading doesn't work at all! Die scum!
   
    - Try echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
   
  * It don't work! I can't use the network at all and I hate you!
   
    - Try
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |$> iptables -F                                                 |
    |$> iptables -t nat -F                                          |
    |$> iptables -t mangle -F                                       |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   
    (all rules went bye-bye) then rerun the other iptables rules.
   
    - Try iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
   
  * It still don't work!
   
    - Hmm, does "dmesg | tail" give any errors? or "cat /var/log/messages |
    tail" ? Like I care tho...
   
  * I don't get, it just ain't working!
   
    - I dunno.. but you should be able to:
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |        1) From the gateway machine, ping the outside          |
    |        2) From the gateway ping your internal machines        |
    |        3) From the internal machines ping the gateway         |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   
    And this is before you play with masq'ing
   
  * Where do I put this stuff?
   
    - In the /etc/network/interfaces file, or firewall.rc. If you put it in
    the interfaces file, then put it as a pre-up to the external interface,
    and have "iptables -t nat -F" as the post-down.
   
  * How do I get it to only bring the ppp up on demand?
   
    - Assuming your ISP gateway IP is say 23.43.12.43 for arguments sake,
    then append a line like this:
   
    :23.43.12.43
   
    to /etc/ppp/peers/provider at the end. (this is for dynamic IP - static
    IP would be my.external.ip.number:23.43.12.43 )
   
    Then at the end of that file add on a newline:
   
    demand
   
    Pppd will remain in the background to redial the connection on demand if
    it's dropped until you do an "ifdown ppp0" or a "poff", unless you add a
    "nopersist" option, in which case pppd will exit after the connection is
    up. You can also add on a new line "idle 600" to disconnect after 10 mins
    of idleness.
   
   
  * The connection keeps dropping!
   
    - First, do you have demand dialing? Is it just doing what it is supposed
    to? Check /etc/ppp/peers/provider, and make sure your dial up works fine
    before attempting masq'ing.
   
    - Secondly, if not, then perhaps, like me, something is going weird, and
    you need to fall back to Linux 2.4.3 and see if that works instead..
    dunno why.
   
  * I hate doing this myself! I want a pre-made script and GUI and stuff.
   
    - Sure: [http://shorewall.sourceforge.net/] http://
    shorewall.sourceforge.net/
   
    Eat your heart out!
   
  * Do I count Cable modems as static or dynamic IP's?
   
    - Good question.. might as well make it dynamic.
   
  * Do I count DHCP network cards as static or dynamic IP's?
   
    - They are dynamic.
   
  * How do I handle incomming services?
   
    - Try forwarding or redirecting the IP ports - again make sure you
    firewall this if needed.
   
  * From the clients, I can ping the linux gateway's external IP address, but
    can't access the internet.
   
    - Okay, try doing "rmmod iptable_filter" - more info on this as I get it.
   
    - Make sure your not running routed or gated - to check run "ps aux |
    grep -e routed -e gated".
   
    - Look at [http://ipmasq.cjb.net] http://ipmasq.cjb.net
   
  * How can I view the connections establish? Something like netstat..
   
    - Try cat /proc/net/ip_conntrack
   
  * I need more squid info and routing and stuff!
   
    - Try the Advanced Routing HOWTO http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/
    Adv-Routing-HOWTO.html
   
  * This howto is crap! How do I yell at the guys who wrote this?
   
    - Go to #debian on irc.opensource.net and find and locate JohnFlux. -
    Mail me (JohnFlux) at tapselj0@cs.man.ac.uk
   
  * This howto is crap! How can I see better versions?
   
    - Try [http://ipmasq.cjb.net] http://ipmasq.cjb.net
   
    - Consult the LDP Masq-HOWTO.
   
  * What else are you working on?
   
    Currently I'm writing a guide on linux on
    anti-missile-missiles-made-simple. There's no good guides on protecting
    your system from nuclear attacks for newbies. People seem to think its
    rocket science or something..

  ______________________________________________________________________

  1.  Introduction

  This is the Linux IPCHAINS-HOWTO; see ``Where?''  for the master site,
  which contains the latest copy.  You should read the Linux NET-3-HOWTO
  as well.  The IP-Masquerading HOWTO, the PPP-HOWTO, the Ethernet-HOWTO
  and the Firewall HOWTO might make interesting reading.  (Then again,
  so might the alt.fan.bigfoot FAQ).


  If packet filtering is passe to you, read Section ``Why?'', Section
  ``How?'', and scan through the titles in Section ``IP Firewalling
  Chains''.


  If you are converting from ipfwadm, read Section ``Introduction'',
  Section ``How?'', and Appendices in section ``Differences between
  ipchains and ipfwadm'' and section ``Using the `ipfwadm-wrapper'
  script''.


  1.1.  What?

  Linux ipchains is a rewrite of the Linux IPv4 firewalling code (which
  was mainly stolen from BSD) and a rewrite of ipfwadm, which was a
  rewrite of BSD's ipfw, I believe.  It is required to administer the IP
  packet filters in Linux kernel versions 2.1.102 and above.


  1.2.  Why?

  The older Linux firewalling code doesn't deal with fragments, has
  32-bit counters (on Intel at least), doesn't allow specification of
  protocols other than TCP, UDP or ICMP, can't make large changes
  atomically, can't specify inverse rules, has some quirks, and can be
  tough to manage (making it prone to user error).


  1.3.  How?

  Currently the code is in the mainstream kernel from 2.1.102.  For the
  2.0 kernel series, you will need to download a kernel patch from the
  web page.  If your 2.0 kernel is more recent than the supplied patch,
  the older patch should be OK; this part of the 2.0 kernels is fairly
  stable (eg. the 2.0.34 kernel patch works just fine on the 2.0.35
  kernel).  Since the 2.0 patch is incompatible with the ipportfw and
  ipautofw patches, I don't recommend applying it unless you really need
  some functionality that ipchains offers.


  1.4.  Where?

  The official page is in three places: Thanks to Penguin Computing
  <http://netfilter.filewatcher.org/ipchains> Thanks to the SAMBA Team
  <http://www.samba.org/netfilter/ipchains> Thanks to Jim Pick
  <http://netfilter.kernelnotes.org/ipchains>


  There is a mailing list for bug reports, discussion, development and
  usage.  Join the mailing list by sending a message containing the word
  ``subscribe ipchains-list'' to subscribe at east.balius.com.  To mail
  to everyone on the list use ipchains-list at east.balius.com.


  2.  Packet Filtering Basics

  2.1.  What?

  All traffic through a network is sent in the form of packets.  For
  example, downloading this package (say it's 50k long) might cause you
  to receive 36 or so packets of 1460 bytes each, (to pull numbers at
  random).
  The start of each packet says where it's going, where it came from,
  the type of the packet, and other administrative details.  This start
  of the packet is called the header.  The rest of the packet,
  containing the actual data being transmitted, is usually called the
  body.


  Some protocols, such TCP, which is used for web traffic, mail, and
  remote logins, use the concept of a `connection' -- before any packets
  with actual data are sent, various setup packets (with special
  headers) are exchanged saying `I want to connect', `OK' and `Thanks'.
  Then normal packets are exchanged.


  A packet filter is a piece of software which looks at the header of
  packets as they pass through, and decides the fate of the entire
  packet.  It might decide to deny the packet (ie. discard the packet as
  if it had never received it), accept the packet (ie. let the packet go
  through), or reject the packet (like deny, but tell the source of the
  packet that it has done so).


  Under Linux, packet filtering is built into the kernel, and there are
  a few trickier things we can do with packets, but the general
  principle of looking at the headers and deciding the fate of the
  packet is still there.


  2.2.  Why?

  Control.  Security.  Watchfulness.



     Control:
        when you are using a Linux box to connect your internal network
        to another network (say, the Internet) you have an opportunity
        to allow certain types of traffic, and disallow others.  For
        example, the header of a packet contains the destination address
        of the packet, so you can prevent packets going to a certain
        part of the outside network.  As another example, I use Netscape
        to access the Dilbert archives.  There are advertisements from
        doubleclick.net on the page, and Netscape wastes my time by
        cheerfully downloading them.  Telling the packet filter not to
        allow any packets to or from the addresses owned by
        doubleclick.net solves that problem (there are better ways of
        doing this though).


     Security:
        when your Linux box is the only thing between the chaos of the
        Internet and your nice, orderly network, it's nice to know you
        can restrict what comes tromping in your door.  For example, you
        might allow anything to go out from your network, but you might
        be worried about the well-known `Ping of Death' coming in from
        malicious outsiders.  As another example, you might not want
        outsiders telnetting to your Linux box, even though all your
        accounts have passwords; maybe you want (like most people) to be
        an observer on the Internet, and not a server (willing or
        otherwise) -- simply don't let anyone connect in, by having the
        packet filter reject incoming packets used to set up
        connections.


     Watchfulness:
        sometimes a badly configured machine on the local network will
        decide to spew packets to the outside world.  It's nice to tell
        the packet filter to let you know if anything abnormal occurs;
        maybe you can do something about it, or maybe you're just
        curious by nature.


  2.3.  How?

  2.3.1.  A Kernel With Packet Filtering

  You need a kernel which has the new IP firewall chains in it.  You can
  tell if the kernel you are running right now has this installed by
  looking for the file `/proc/net/ip_fwchains'.  If it exists, you're
  in.


  If not, you need to make a kernel that has IP firewall chains.  First,
  download the source to the kernel you want.  If you have a kernel
  numbered 2.1.102 or higher, you won't need to patch it (it's in the
  mainstream kernel now).  Otherwise, apply the patch from the web page
  listed above, and set the configuration as detailed below.  If you
  don't know how to do this, don't panic -- read the Kernel-HOWTO.



  The configuration options you will need to set for the 2.0-series
  kernel are:


  ______________________________________________________________________
          CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL=y
          CONFIG_FIREWALL=y
          CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL=y
          CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL_CHAINS=y
  ______________________________________________________________________



  For the 2.1 or 2.2 series kernels:

  ______________________________________________________________________
          CONFIG_FIREWALL=y
          CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL=y
  ______________________________________________________________________



  The tool ipchains talks to the kernel and tells it what packets to
  filter.  Unless you are a programmer, or overly curious, this is how
  you will control the packet filtering.


  2.3.2.  ipchains

  The ipchains tool inserts and deletes rules from the kernel's packet
  filtering section.  This means that whatever you set up, it will be
  lost upon reboot; see ``Making Rules Permanent'' for how to make sure
  they are restored the next time Linux is booted.


  ipchains replaces ipfwadm, which was used for the old IP Firewall
  code.  There is a set of useful scripts available from the ipchains
  ftp site:


  http://netfilter.filewatcher.org/ipchains/ipchains-
  scripts-1.1.2.tar.gz
  <http://netfilter.filewatcher.org/ipchains/ipchains-
  scripts-1.1.2.tar.gz>


  This contains a shell script called ipfwadm-wrapper which allows you
  to do packet filtering as it was done before.  You probably shouldn't
  use this script unless you want a quick way of upgrading a system
  which uses ipfwadm (it's slower, and doesn't check arguments, etc).
  In that case, you don't need this HOWTO much either.

  See Appendix ``Differences between ipchains and ipfwadm'' and Appendix
  ``Using the `ipfwadm-wrapper' script'' for more details on ipfwadm
  issues.


  2.3.3.  Making Rules Permanent

  Your current firewall setup is stored in the kernel, and thus will be
  lost on reboot.  I recommend using the `ipchains-save' and `ipchains-
  restore' scripts to make your rules permanent.  To do this, set up
  your rules, then run (as root):



       # ipchains-save > /etc/ipchains.rules
       #



  Create a script like the following:



  #! /bin/sh
  # Script to control packet filtering.

  # If no rules, do nothing.
  [ -f /etc/ipchains.rules ] || exit 0

  case "$1" in
      start)
          echo -n "Turning on packet filtering:"
          /sbin/ipchains-restore < /etc/ipchains.rules || exit 1
          echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
          echo "."
          ;;
      stop)
          echo -n "Turning off packet filtering:"
          echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
          /sbin/ipchains -F
          /sbin/ipchains -X
          /sbin/ipchains -P input ACCEPT
          /sbin/ipchains -P output ACCEPT
          /sbin/ipchains -P forward ACCEPT
          echo "."
          ;;
      *)
          echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/packetfilter {start|stop}"
          exit 1
          ;;
  esac

  exit 0



  Make sure this is run early in the bootup procedure.  In my case
  (Debian 2.1), I make a symbolic link called `S39packetfilter' in the
  `/etc/rcS.d' directory (this will be run before S40network).


  3.  I'm confused!  Routing, masquerading, portforwarding, ipautofw...

  This HOWTO is about packet filtering.  This means deciding whether a
  packet should be allowed to pass or not.  However, Linux being the
  hacker's playground that it is, you probably want to do more than
  that.


  One problem is that the same tool (``ipchains'') is used to control
  both masquerading and transparent proxying, although these are
  notionally separate from packet filtering (the current Linux
  implementation blurs these together unnaturally, leaving the
  impression that they are closely related).


  Masquerading and proxying are covered by separate HOWTOs, and the auto
  forwarding and port forwarding features are controlled by separate
  tools, but since so many people keep asking me about it, I'll include
  a set of common scenarios and indicate when each one should be
  applied.  The security merits of each setup will not be discussed
  here.


  3.1.  Rusty's Three-Line Guide To Masquerading

  This assumes that your external interface is called `ppp0'.  Use
  ifconfig to find out, and adjust to taste.
       # ipchains -P forward DENY
       # ipchains -A forward -i ppp0 -j MASQ
       # echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward



  3.2.  Gratuitous Promotion: WatchGuard Rules

  You can buy off-the-shelf firewalls.  An excellent one is WatchGuard's
  FireBox.  It's excellent because I like it, it's secure, it's Linux-
  based, and because they funded the maintenance of ipchains as well as
  the new firewalling code (for 2.4).  In short, WatchGuard were paying
  for me to eat while I work for you.  So please consider their stuff.

  http://www.watchguard.com <http://www.watchguard.com>


  3.3.  Common Firewall-like Setups

  You run littlecorp.com.  You have an internal network, and a single
  dialup (PPP) connection to the Internet (firewall.littlecorp.com which
  is 1.2.3.4).  You run Ethernet on your local network, and your
  personal machine is called "myhost".


  This section will illustrate the different arrangement which are
  common.  Read carefully, because they are each subtly different.


  3.3.1.  Private Network: Traditional Proxies

  In this scenario, packets from the private network never traverse the
  Internet, and vice versa.  The IP addresses of the private network
  should be assigned from the RFC1918 Address Allocation for Private
  Internets (ie. 10.*.*.*, 172.16.*.*-172.31.*.* or 192.168.*.*).


  The only way things ever connect to the Internet is by connecting to
  the firewall, which is the only machine on both networks which
  connects onwards.  You run a program (on the firewall) called a proxy
  to do this (there are proxies for FTP, web access, telnet, RealAudio,
  Usenet News and other services).  See the Firewall HOWTO.


  Any services you wish the Internet to access must be on the firewall.
  (But see ``Limited Internal Services'' below).


  Example: Allowing web access from private network to the Internet.

  1. The private network is assigned 192.168.1.* addresses, with myhost
     being 192.168.1.100, and the firewall's Ethernet interface being
     assigned 192.168.1.1.

  2. A web proxy (eg. "squid") is installed and configured on the
     firewall, say running on port 8080.

  3. Netscape on the private network is configured to use the firewall
     port 8080 as a proxy.

  4. DNS does not need to be configured on the private network.

  5. DNS does need to be configured on the firewall.

  6. No default route (aka gateway) needs to be configured on the
     private network.


  Netscape on myhost reads http://slashdot.org.

  1. Netscape connects to the firewall port 8080, using port 1050 on
     myhost.  It asks for the web page of "http://slashdot.org".

  2. The proxy looks up the name "slashdot.org", and gets
     207.218.152.131.  It then opens a connection to that IP address
     (using port 1025 on the firewall's external interface), and asks
     the web server (port 80) for the web page.

  3. As it receives the web page from its connection to the web server,
     it copies the data to the connection from Netscape.

  4. Netscape renders the page.

  ie.  From slashdot.org's point of view, the connection is made from
  1.2.3.4 (firewall's PPP interface) port 1025 to 207.218.152.131
  (slashdot.org) port 80.  From myhost's point of view, the connection
  is made from 192.168.1.100 (myhost) port 1050, to 192.168.1.1
  (firewall's Ethernet interface) port 8080.



  3.3.2.  Private Network: Transparent Proxies

  In this scenario, packets from the private network never traverse the
  Internet, and vice versa.  The IP addresses of the private network
  should be assigned from the RFC1918 Address Allocation for Private
  Internets (ie. 10.*.*.*, 172.16.*.*-172.31.*.* or 192.168.*.*).


  The only way things ever connect to the Internet is by connecting to
  the firewall, which is the only machine on both networks, which
  connects onwards.  You run a program (on the firewall) called a
  transparent proxy to do this; the kernel sends outgoing packets to the
  transparent proxy instead of sending them onwards (ie. it bastardizes
  routing).


  Transparent proxying means that the clients don't need to know there
  is a proxy involved.


  Any services you wish the Internet to access must be on the firewall.
  (But see ``Limited Internal Services'' below).


  Example: Allowing web access from private network to the Internet.

  1. The private network is assigned 192.168.1.* addresses, with myhost
     being 192.168.1.100, and the firewall's Ethernet interface being
     assigned 192.168.1.1.

  2. A transparent web proxy (I believe there are patches for squid to
     allow it to operate in this manner, or try "transproxy") is
     installed and configured on the firewall, say running on port 8080.

  3. The kernel is told to redirect connections to port 80 to the proxy,
     using ipchains.

  4. Netscape on the private network is configured to connect directly.

  5. DNS needs to be configured on the private network (ie. you need to
     run a DNS server as a proxy on the firewall).

  6. The default route (aka gateway) needs to be configured on the
     private network, to send packets to the firewall.


  Netscape on myhost reads http://slashdot.org.

  1. Netscape looks up the name "slashdot.org", and gets
     207.218.152.131.  It then opens a connection to that IP address,
     using local port 1050, and asks the web server (port 80) for the
     web page.

  2. As the packets from myhost (port 1050) to slashdot.org (port 80)
     pass through the firewall, they are redirected to the waiting
     transparent proxy on port 8080.  The transparent proxy opens a
     connection (using local port 1025) to 207.218.152.131 port 80
     (which is where the original packets were going).

  3. As the proxy receives the web page from its connection to the web
     server, it copies the data to the connection from Netscape.

  4. Netscape renders the page.

  ie.  From slashdot.org's point of view, the connection is made from
  1.2.3.4 (firewall's PPP interface) port 1025 to 207.218.152.131
  (slashdot.org) port 80.  From myhost's point of view, the connection
  is made from 192.168.1.100 (myhost) port 1050, to 207.218.152.131
  (slashdot.org) port 80, but it's actually talking to the transparent
  proxy.


  3.3.3.  Private Network: Masquerading

  In this scenario, packets from the private network never traverse the
  Internet without special treatment, and vice versa.  The IP addresses
  of the private network should be assigned from the RFC1918 Address
  Allocation for Private Internets (ie. 10.*.*.*, 172.16.*.*-172.31.*.*
  or 192.168.*.*).


  Instead of using a proxy, we use a special kernel facility called
  "masquerading".  Masquerading rewrites packets as they pass through
  the firewall, so that they always seem to come from the firewall
  itself.  It then rewrites the responses so that they look like they
  are going to the original recipient.


  Masquerading has separate modules to handle "tricky" protocols, such
  as FTP, RealAudio, Quake, etc.  For really hard-to-handle protocols,
  the "auto forwarding" facility can handle some of them by
  automatically setting up port forwarding for related sets of ports:
  look for ``ipportfw'' (2.0 kernels) or ``ipmasqadm'' (2.1 kernels).


  Any services you wish the Internet to access must be on the firewall.
  (But see ``Limited Internal Services'' below).


  Example: Allowing web access from private network to the Internet.

  1. The private network is assigned 192.168.1.* addresses, with myhost
     being 192.168.1.100, and the firewall's Ethernet interface being
     assigned 192.168.1.1.

  2. The firewall is set up to masquerade any packets coming from the
     private network and going to port 80 on an Internet host.

  3. Netscape is configured to connect directly.

  4. DNS must be configured correctly on the private network.

  5. The firewall should be the default route (aka gateway) for the
     private network.

  Netscape on myhost reads http://slashdot.org.

  1. Netscape looks up the name "slashdot.org", and gets
     207.218.152.131.  It then opens a connection to that IP address,
     using local port 1050, and asks the web server (port 80) for the
     web page.

  2. As the packets from myhost (port 1050) to slashdot.org (port 80)
     pass through the firewall, they are rewritten to come from the PPP
     interface of the firewall, port 65000.  The firewall has a valid
     Internet address (1.2.3.4) so reply packets from slashdot.org get
     routed back OK.

  3. As packets from slashdot.org (port 80) to firewall.littlecorp.com
     (port 65000) come in, they are rewritten to go to myhost, port
     1050.  This is the real magic of masquerading: it remembers when it
     rewrites outgoing packets to it can write them back as replies come
     in.

  4. Netscape renders the page.

  ie.  From the slashdot.org's point of view, the connection is made
  from 1.2.3.4 (firewall's PPP interface) port 65000 to 207.218.152.131
  (slashdot.org) port 80.  From the myhost's point of view, the
  connection is made from 192.168.1.100 (myhost) port 1050, to
  207.218.152.131 (slashdot.org) port 80.



  3.3.4.  Public Network

  In this scenario, your personal network is a part of the Internet:
  packets can flow without change across both networks.  The IP
  addresses of the internal network must be assigned by applying for a
  block of IP addresses, so the rest of the network will know how to get
  packets to you.  This implies a permanent connection.


  In this role, packet filtering is used to restrict which packets can
  be forwarded between your network and the rest of the Internet, eg. to
  restrict the rest of the Internet to only accessing your internal web
  servers.


  Example: Allowing web access from private network to the Internet.

  1. Your internal network is assigned according to the IP address block
     you have registered, (say 1.2.3.*).

  2. The firewall is set up to allow all traffic.

  3. Netscape is configured to connect directly.

  4. DNS must be configured correctly on your network.


  5. The firewall should be the default route (aka gateway) for the
     private network.

  Netscape on myhost reads http://slashdot.org.

  1. Netscape looks up the name "slashdot.org", and gets
     207.218.152.131.  It then opens a connection to that IP address,
     using local port 1050, and asks the web server (port 80) for the
     web page.

  2. Packets pass through your firewall, just as they pass through
     several other routers between you and slashdot.org.

  3. Netscape renders the page.

  ie.  There is only one connection: from 1.2.3.100 (myhost) port 1050,
  to 207.218.152.131 (slashdot.org) port 80.


  3.3.5.  Limited Internal Services

  There are a few tricks you can pull to allow the Internet to access
  your internal services, rather than running the services on the
  firewall.  These will work with either a proxy or masquerading based
  approach for external connections.


  The simplest approach is to run a "redirector", which is a poor-man's
  proxy which waits for a connection on a given port, and then open a
  connection a fixed internal host and port, and copies data between the
  two connections.  An example of this is the "redir" program.  From the
  Internet point of view, the connection is made to your firewall.  From
  your internal server's point of view, the connection is made from the
  internal interface of the firewall to the server.


  Another approach (which requires a 2.0 kernel patched for ipportfw, or
  a 2.1 or later kernel) is to use port forwarding in the kernel.  This
  does the same job as "redir" in a different way: the kernel rewrites
  packets as they pass through, changing their destination address and
  ports to point them at an internal host and port.  From the Internet's
  point of view, the connection is made to your firewall.  From your
  internal server's point of view, a direct connection is made from the
  Internet host to the server.


  3.4.  More Information on Masquerading

  David Ranch has written an excellent new HOWTO on Masquerading, which
  has a large amount of overlap with this HOWTO.  You can currently find
  that HOWTO at

  4.  IP Firewalling Chains

  This section describes all you really need to know to build a packet
  filter that meets your needs.

  4.1.  How Packets Traverse The Filters

  The kernel starts with three lists of rules; these lists are called
  firewall chains or just chains.  The three chains are called input,
  output and forward.  When a packet comes in (say, through the Ethernet
  card) the kernel uses the input chain to decide its fate.  If it
  survives that step, then the kernel decides where to send the packet
  next (this is called routing).  If it is destined for another machine,
  it consults the forward chain.  Finally, just before a packet is to go
  out, the kernel consults the output chain.


  A chain is a checklist of rules.  Each rule says `if the packet header
  looks like this, then here's what to do with the packet'.  If the rule
  doesn't match the packet, then the next rule in the chain is
  consulted.  Finally, if there are no more rules to consult, then the
  kernel looks at the chain policy to decide what to do.  In a security-
  conscious system, this policy usually tells the kernel to reject or
  deny the packet.


  For ASCII-art fans, this shown the complete path of a packet coming
  into a machine.


          ----------------------------------------------------------------
          |            ACCEPT/                              lo interface |

      k     t       |        s       |             |     | |     |
      s     y       |        q       |             v     | |     |
      u     |       v        e       v            DENY/  | |     v
      m     |     DENY/      r   Local Process   REJECT  | |   DENY/
      |     v    REJECT      a       |                   | |  REJECT
      |   DENY               d       --------------------- |
      v                      e -----------------------------
     DENY


  Here is a blow-by-blow description of each stage:


     Checksum:
        This is a test that the packet hasn't been corrupted in some
        way.  If it has, it is denied.


     Sanity:
        There is actually one of these sanity checks before each
        firewall chain, but the input chain's is the most important.
        Some malformed packets might confuse the rule-checking code, and
        these are denied here (a message is printed to the syslog if
        this happens).


     input chain:
        This is the first firewall chain against which the packet will
        be tested.  If the verdict of the chain is not DENY or REJECT,
        the packet continues on.


     Demasquerade:
        If the packet is a reply to a previously masqueraded packet, it
        is demasqueraded, and skips straight to the output chain.  If
        you don't use IP Masquerading, you can mentally erase this from
        the diagram.


     Routing decision:
        The destination field is examined by the routing code, to decide
        if this packet should go to a local process (see Local process
        below) or forwarded to a remote machine (see forward chain
        below).


     Local process:
        A process running on the machine can receive packets after the
        Routing Decision step, and can send packets (which go through
        the Routing Decision step, then traverse the output chain).


     lo interface:
        If packets from a local process are destined for a local
        process, they will go through the output chain with interface
        set to `lo', then return through the input chain with interface
        also `lo'.  The lo interface is usually called the loopback
        interface.


     local:
        If the packet was not created by a local process, then the
        forward chain is checked, otherwise the packet goes to the
        output chain.


     forward chain:
        This chain is traversed for any packets which are attempting to
        pass through this machine to another.


     output chain:
        This chain is traversed for all packets just before they are
        sent out.


  4.1.1.  Using ipchains

  First, check that you have the version of ipchains that this document
  refers to:



       $ ipchains --version
       ipchains 1.3.9, 17-Mar-1999



  Note that I recommend 1.3.4 (which has no long options, like
  `--sport'), or 1.3.8 or above; these are very stable.


  ipchains has a fairly detailed manual page (man ipchains), and if you
  need more detail on particulars, you can check out the programming
  interface (man 4 ipfw), or the file net/ipv4/ip_fw.c in the 2.1.x
  kernel source, which is (obviously) authoritative.


  There is also an excellent quick reference card by Scott Bronson in
  the source package, in both A4 and US Letter PostScript(TM).


  There are several different things you can do with ipchains.  First
  the operations to manage whole chains.  You start with three built-in
  chains input, output and forward which you can't delete.


  1. Create a new chain (-N).

  2. Delete an empty chain (-X).

  3. Change the policy for a built-in chain. (-P).

  4. List the rules in a chain (-L).

  5. Flush the rules out of a chain (-F).

  6. Zero the packet and byte counters on all rules in a chain (-Z).

  There are several ways to manipulate rules inside a chain:


  1. Append a new rule to a chain (-A).

  2. Insert a new rule at some position in a chain (-I).

  3. Replace a rule at some position in a chain (-R).

  4. Delete a rule at some position in a chain (-D).

  5. Delete the first rule that matches in a chain (-D).

  There are a few operations for masquerading, which are in ipchains for
  want of a good place to put them:


  1. List the currently masqueraded connections (-M -L).

  2. Set masquerading timeout values (-M -S). (But see ``I can't set
     masquerading timeouts!'').

  The final (and perhaps the most useful) function allows you to check
  what would happen to a given packet if it were to traverse a given
  chain.


  4.1.2.  What You'll See When Your Computer Starts Up

  Before any ipchains commands have been run (be careful: some
  distributions run ipchains in their initialization scripts), there
  will be no rules in any of the built-in chains (`input', `forward' and
  `output'), and each of the chains will have a policy of ACCEPT.  This
  is as wide-open as you can get.


  4.1.3.  Operations on a Single Rule

  This is the bread-and-butter of ipchains; manipulating rules.  Most
  commonly, you will probably use the append (-A) and delete (-D)
  commands.  The others (-I for insert and -R for replace) are simple
  extensions of these concepts.



  Each rule specifies a set of conditions the packet must meet, and what
  to do if it meets them (a `target').  For example, you might want to
  deny all ICMP packets coming from the IP address 127.0.0.1.  So in
  this case our conditions are that the protocol must be ICMP and that
  the source address must be 127.0.0.1.  Our target is `DENY'.


  127.0.0.1 is the `loopback' interface, which you will have even if you
  have no real network connection.  You can use the `ping' program to
  generate such packets (it simply sends an ICMP type 8 (echo request)
  which all cooperative hosts should obligingly respond to with an ICMP
  type 0 (echo reply) packet).  This makes it useful for testing.



       # ping -c 1 127.0.0.1
       PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes
       64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.2 ms

       --- 127.0.0.1 ping statistics ---
       1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0% packet loss
       round-trip min/avg/max = 0.2/0.2/0.2 ms
       # ipchains -A input -s 127.0.0.1 -p icmp -j DENY
       # ping -c 1 127.0.0.1
       PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes

       --- 127.0.0.1 ping statistics ---
       1 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss
       #



  You can see here that the first ping succeeds (the `-c 1' tells ping
  to only send a single packet).


  Then we append (-A) to the `input' chain, a rule specifying that for
  packets from 127.0.0.1 (`-s 127.0.0.1') with protocol ICMP (`-p ICMP')
  we should jump to DENY (`-j DENY').


  Then we test our rule, using the second ping.  There will be a pause
  before the program gives up waiting for a response that will never
  come.


  We can delete the rule in one of two ways.  Firstly, since we know
  that it is the only rule in the input chain, we can use a numbered
  delete, as in:


               # ipchains -D input 1
               #



  To delete rule number 1 in the input chain.


  The second way is to mirror the -A command, but replacing the -A with
  -D.  This is useful when you have a complex chain of rules and you
  don't want to have to count them to figure out that it's rule 37 that
  you want to get rid of.  In this case, we would use:

          # ipchains -D input -s 127.0.0.1 -p icmp -j DENY
          #



  The syntax of -D must have exactly the same options as the -A (or -I
  or -R) command.  If there are multiple identical rules in the same
  chain, only the first will be deleted.


  4.1.4.  Filtering Specifications

  We have seen the use of `-p' to specify protocol, and `-s' to specify
  source address, but there are other options we can use to specify
  packet characteristics.  What follows is an exhaustive compendium.


  4.1.4.1.  Specifying Source and Destination IP Addresses

  Source (-s) and destination (-d) IP addresses can be specified in four
  ways.  The most common way is to use the full name, such as
  `localhost' or `www.linuxhq.com'.  The second way is to specify the IP
  address such as `127.0.0.1'.


  The third and fourth ways allow specification of a group of IP
  addresses, such as `199.95.207.0/24' or `199.95.207.0/255.255.255.0'.
  These both specify any IP address from 199.95.207.0 to 199.95.207.255
  inclusive; the digits after the `/' tell which parts of the IP address
  are significant.  `/32' or `/255.255.255.255' is the default (match
  all of the IP address).  To specify any IP address at all `/0' can be
  used, like so:


               # ipchains -A input -s 0/0 -j DENY
               #



  This is rarely used, as the effect above is the same as not specifying
  the `-s' option at all.


  4.1.4.2.  Specifying Inversion

  Many flags, including the `-s' and `-d' flags can have their arguments
  preceded by `!' (pronounced `not') to match addresses NOT equal to the
  ones given.  For example. `-s ! localhost' matches any packet not
  coming from localhost.


  Don't forget the spaces around the `!': they really are needed.


  4.1.4.3.  Specifying Protocol

  The protocol can be specified with the `-p' flag.  Protocol can be a
  number (if you know the numeric protocol values for IP) or a name for
  the special cases of `TCP', `UDP' or `ICMP'.  Case doesn't matter, so
  `tcp' works as well as `TCP'.


  The protocol name can be prefixed by a `!', to invert it, such as `-p
  ! TCP'.
  4.1.4.3.1.  Specifying UDP and TCP Ports

  For the special case where a protocol of TCP or UDP is specified,
  there can be an extra argument indicating the TCP or UDP port, or an
  (inclusive) range of ports (but see ``Handling Fragments'' below).  A
  range is represented using a `:' character, such as `6000:6010', which
  covers 11 port numbers, from 6000 to 6010 inclusive.  If the lower
  bound is omitted, it defaults to 0.  If the upper bound is omitted, it
  defaults to 65535.  So to specify TCP connections coming from ports
  under 1024, the syntax would be as `-p TCP -s 0.0.0.0/0 :1023'.  Port
  numbers can be specified by name, eg. `www'.


  Note that the port specification can be preceded by a `!', which
  inverts it.  So to specify every TCP packet BUT a WWW packet, you
  would specify

  -p TCP -d 0.0.0.0/0 ! www



  It is important to realize that the specification


  -p TCP -d ! 192.168.1.1 www



  is very different from

  -p TCP -d 192.168.1.1 ! www



  The first specifies any TCP packet to the WWW port on any machine but
  192.168.1.1.  The second specifies any TCP connection to any port on
  192.168.1.1 but the WWW port.


  Finally, this case means not the WWW port and not 192.168.1.1:

  -p TCP -d ! 192.168.1.1 ! www



  4.1.4.3.2.  Specifying ICMP Type and Code

  ICMP also allows an optional argument, but as ICMP doesn't have ports,
  (ICMP has a type and a code) they have a different meaning.


  You can specify them as ICMP names (use ipchains -h icmp to list the
  names) after the `-s' option, or as a numeric ICMP type and code,
  where the type follows the `-s' option and the code follows the `-d'
  option.


  The ICMP names are fairly long: you only need use enough letters to
  make the name distinct from any other.


  Here is a small table of some of the most common ICMP packets:



  Number  Name                     Required by

  0       echo-reply               ping
  3       destination-unreachable  Any TCP/UDP traffic.
  5       redirect                 routing if not running routing daemon
  8       echo-request             ping
  11      time-exceeded            traceroute



  Note that the ICMP names cannot be preceeded by `!' at the moment.


  DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT block all ICMP type 3 messages!  (See ``ICMP
  Packets'' below).


  4.1.4.4.  Specifying an Interface

  The `-i' option specifies the name of an interface to match.  An
  interface is the physical device the packet came in on, or is going
  out on.  You can use the ifconfig command to list the interfaces which
  are `up' (ie. working at the moment).


  The interface for incoming packets (ie. packets traversing the input
  chain) is considered to be the interface they came in on.  Logically,
  the interface for outgoing packets (packets traversing the output
  chain) is the interface they will go out on.  The interface for
  packets traversing the forward chain is also the interface they will
  go out on; a fairly arbitrary decision it seems to me.


  It is perfectly legal to specify an interface that currently does not
  exist; the rule will not match anything until the interface comes up.
  This is extremely useful for dial-up PPP links (usually interface
  ppp0) and the like.


  As a special case, an interface name ending with a `+' will match all
  interfaces (whether they currently exist or not) which begin with that
  string.  For example, to specify a rule which matches all PPP
  interfaces, the -i ppp+ option would be used.


  The interface name can be preceded by a `!' to match a packet which
  does NOT match the specified interface(s).


  4.1.4.5.  Specifying TCP SYN Packets Only

  It is sometimes useful to allow TCP connections in one direction, but
  not the other.  For example, you might want to allow connections to an
  external WWW server, but not connections from that server.


  The naive approach would be to block TCP packets coming from the
  server.  Unfortunately, TCP connections require packets going in both
  directions to work at all.


  The solution is to block only the packets used to request a
  connection.  These packets are called SYN packets (ok, technically
  they're packets with the SYN flag set, and the FIN and ACK flags
  cleared, but we call them SYN packets).  By disallowing only these
  packets, we can stop attempted connections in their tracks.


  The `-y' flag is used for this: it is only valid for rules which
  specify TCP as their protocol.  For example, to specify TCP connection
  attempts from 192.168.1.1:

  -p TCP -s 192.168.1.1 -y



  Once again, this flag can be inverted by preceding it with a `!',
  which means every packet other than the connection initiation.


  4.1.4.6.  Handling Fragments

  Sometimes a packet is too large to fit down a wire all at once.  When
  this happens, the packet is divided into fragments, and sent as
  multiple packets.  The other end reassembles the fragments to
  reconstruct the whole packet.


  The problem with fragments is that some of the specifications listed
  above (in particular, source port, destinations port, ICMP type, ICMP
  code, or TCP SYN flag) require the kernel to peek at the start of the
  packet, which is only contained in the first fragment.


  If your machine is the only connection to an external network, then
  you can tell the Linux kernel to reassemble all fragments which pass
  through it, by compiling the kernel with IP: always defragment set to
  `Y'.  This sidesteps the issue neatly.


  Otherwise, it is important to understand how fragments get treated by
  the filtering rules.  Any filtering rule that asks for information we
  don't have will not match.  This means that the first fragment is
  treated like any other packet.  Second and further fragments won't be.
  Thus a rule -p TCP -s 192.168.1.1 www (specifying a source port of
  `www') will never match a fragment (other than the first fragment).
  Neither will the opposite rule -p TCP -s 192.168.1.1 ! www.


  However, you can specify a rule specifically for second and further
  fragments, using the `-f' flag.  Obviously, it is illegal to specify a
  TCP or UDP port, ICMP type, ICMP code or TCP SYN flag in such a
  fragment rule.


  It is also legal to specify that a rule does not apply to second and
  further fragments, by preceding the `-f' with `!'.


  Usually it is regarded as safe to let second and further fragments
  through, since filtering will effect the first fragment, and thus
  prevent reassembly on the target host, however, bugs have been known
  to allow crashing of machines simply by sending fragments.  Your call.


  Note for network-heads: malformed packets (TCP, UDP and ICMP packets
  too short for the firewalling code to read the ports or ICMP code and
  type) are treated as fragments as well.  Only TCP fragments starting
  at position 8 are explicitly dropped by the firewall code (a message
  should appear in the syslog if this occurs).
  As an example, the following rule will drop any fragments going to
  192.168.1.1:



       # ipchains -A output -f -d 192.168.1.1 -j DENY
       #



  4.1.5.  Filtering Side Effects

  OK, so now we know all the ways we can match a packet using a rule.
  If a packet matches a rule, the following things happen:


  1. The byte counter for that rule is increased by the size of the
     packet (header and all).

  2. The packet counter for that rule is incremented.

  3. If the rule requests it, the packet is logged.

  4. If the rule requests it, the packet's Type Of Service field is
     changed.

  5. If the rule requests it, the packet is marked (not in 2.0 kernel
     series).

  6. The rule target is examined to decide what to do to the packet
     next.


  For variety, I'll address these in order of importance.


  4.1.5.1.  Specifying a Target

  A target tells the kernel what to do with a packet that matches a
  rule.  ipchains uses `-j' (think `jump-to') for the target
  specification.  The target name must be less than 8 letters, and case
  matters: "RETURN" and "return" are completely different.


  The simplest case is when there is no target specified.  This type of
  rule (often called an `accounting' rule) is useful for simply counting
  a certain type of packet.  Whether this rule matches or not, the
  kernel simply examines the next rule in the chain.  For example, to
  count the number of packets from 192.168.1.1, we could do this:


       # ipchains -A input -s 192.168.1.1
       #



  (Using `ipchains -L -v' we can see the byte and packet counters
  associated with each rule).



  There are six special targets.  The first three, ACCEPT, REJECT and
  DENY are fairly simple.  ACCEPT allows the packet through.  DENY drops
  the packet as if it had never been received.  REJECT drops the packet,
  but (if it's not an ICMP packet) generates an ICMP reply to the source
  to tell it that the destination was unreachable.


  The next one, MASQ tells the kernel to masquerade the packet.  For
  this to work, your kernel needs to be compiled with IP Masquerading
  enabled.  For details on this, see the Masquerading-HOWTO and the
  Appendix ``Differences between ipchains and ipfwadm''.  This target is
  only valid for packets traversing the forward chain.


  The other major special target is REDIRECT which tells the kernel to
  send a packet to a local port instead of wherever it was heading.
  This can only be specified for rules specifying TCP or UDP as their
  protocol.  Optionally, a port (name or number) can be specified
  following `-j REDIRECT' which will cause the packet to be redirected
  to that particular port, even if it was addressed to another port.
  This target is only valid for packets traversing the input chain.


  The final special target is RETURN which is identical to falling off
  the end of the chain immediately.  (See ``Setting Policy'' below).


  Any other target indicates a user-defined chain (as described in
  ``Operations on an Entire Chain'' below).  The packet will begin
  traversing the rules in that chain.  If that chain doesn't decide the
  fate of the packet, then once traversal on that chain has finished,
  traversal resumes on the next rule in the current chain.


  Time for more ASCII art.  Consider two (silly) chains: input (the
  built-in chain) and Test (a user-defined chain).


           `input'                         `Test'
          ----------------------------    ----------------------------
          | Rule1: -p ICMP -j REJECT |    | Rule1: -s 192.168.1.1    |
          |--------------------------|    |--------------------------|
          | Rule2: -p TCP -j Test    |    | Rule2: -d 192.168.1.1    |
          |--------------------------|    ----------------------------
          | Rule3: -p UDP -j DENY    |
          ----------------------------



  Consider a TCP packet coming from 192.168.1.1, going to 1.2.3.4.  It
  enters the input chain, and gets tested against Rule1 - no match.
  Rule2 matches, and its target is Test, so the next rule examined is
  the start of Test.  Rule1 in Test matches, but doesn't specify a
  target, so the next rule is examined, Rule2.  This doesn't match, so
  we have reached the end of the chain.  We return to the input chain,
  where we had just examined Rule2, so we now examine Rule3, which
  doesn't match either.


  So the packet path is:



                                  v    __________________________
           `input'                |   /    `Test'                v
          ------------------------|--/    -----------------------|----
          | Rule1                 | /|    | Rule1                |   |
          |-----------------------|/-|    |----------------------|---|
          | Rule2                 /  |    | Rule2                |   |
          |--------------------------|    -----------------------v----
          | Rule3                 /--+___________________________/
          ------------------------|---
                                  v



  See the section ``How to Organise Your Firewall Rules'' for ways to
  use user-defined chains effectively.


  4.1.5.2.  Logging Packets

  This is a side effect that matching a rule can have; you can have the
  matching packet logged using the `-l' flag.  You will usually not want
  this for routine packets, but it is a useful feature if you want to
  look for exceptional events.


  The kernel logs this information looking like:



       Packet log: input DENY eth0 PROTO=17 192.168.2.1:53 192.168.1.1:1025
         L=34 S=0x00 I=18 F=0x0000 T=254



  This log message is designed to be terse, and contain technical
  information useful only to networking gurus, but it can be useful to
  the rest of us.  It breaks down like so:


  1. `input' is the chain which contained the rule which matched the
     packet, causing the log message.

  2. `DENY' is what the rule said to do to the packet.  If this is `-'
     then the rule didn't effect the packet at all (an accounting rule).

  3. `eth0' is the interface name.  Because this was the input chain, it
     means that the packet came in `eth0'.

  4. `PROTO=17' means that the packet was protocol 17.  A list of
     protocol numbers is given in `/etc/protocols'.  The most common are
     1 (ICMP), 6 (TCP) and 17 (UDP).

  5. `192.168.2.1' means that the packet's source IP address was
     192.168.2.1.

  6. `:53' means that the source port was port 53.  Looking in
     `/etc/services' shows that this is the `domain' port (ie. this is
     probably an DNS reply).  For UDP and TCP, this number is the source
     port.  For ICMP, it's the ICMP type.  For others, it will be 65535.

  7. `192.168.1.1' is the destination IP address.

  8. `:1025' means that the destination port was 1025.  For UDP and TCP,
     this number is the destination port.  For ICMP, it's the ICMP code.
     For others, it will be 65535.

  9. `L=34' means that packet was a total of 34 bytes long.

  10.
     `S=0x00' means the Type of Service field (divide by 4 to get the
     Type of Service as used by ipchains).

  11.
     `I=18' is the IP ID.

  12.
     `F=0x0000' is the 16-bit fragment offset plus flags.  A value
     starting with `0x4' or `0x5' means that the Don't Fragment bit is
     set.  `0x2' or `0x3' means the `More Fragments' bit is set; expect
     more fragments after this.  The rest of the number is the offset of
     this fragment, divided by 8.

  13.
     `T=254' is the Time To Live of the packet.  One is subtracted from
     this value for every hop, and it usually starts at 15 or 255.

  14.
     `(#5)' there may be a final number in brackets on more recent
     kernels (perhaps after 2.2.9).  This is the rule number which
     caused the packet log.


  On standard Linux systems, this kernel output is captured by klogd
  (the kernel logging daemon) which hands it to syslogd (the system
  logging daemon).  The `/etc/syslog.conf' controls the behaviour of
  syslogd, by specifying a destination for each `facility' (in our case,
  the facility is "kernel") and `level' (for ipchains, the level used is
  "info").


  For example, my (Debian) /etc/syslog.conf contains two lines which
  match `kern.info':



       kern.*                          -/var/log/kern.log
       *.=info;*.=notice;*.=warn;\
               auth,authpriv.none;\
               cron,daemon.none;\
               mail,news.none          -/var/log/messages



  These mean that the messags are duplicated in `/var/log/kern.log' and
  `/var/log/messages'.  For more details, see `man syslog.conf'.


  4.1.5.3.  Manipulating the Type Of Service

  There are four seldom-used bits in the IP header, called the Type of
  Service (TOS) bits.  They effect the way packets are treated; the four
  bits are "Minimum Delay", "Maximum Throughput", "Maximum Reliability"
  and "Minimum Cost".  Only one of these bits is allowed to be set.  Rob
  van Nieuwkerk, the author of the TOS-mangling code, puts it as
  follows:


       Especially the "Minimum Delay" is important for me.  I
       switch it on for "interactive" packets in my upstream
  (Linux) router.  I'm behind a 33k6 modem link.  Linux prior­
  itizes packets in 3 queues.  This way I get acceptable
  interactive performance while doing bulk downloads at the
  same time.  (It could even be better if there wasn't such a
  big queue in the serial driver, but latency is kept down 1.5
  seconds now).



  Note: obviously, you have no control over incoming packets; you can
  only control the priority of packets leaving your box.  To negotiate
  priorities with the other end, a protocol like RSVP (which I know
  nothing about, so don't ask me) must be used.


  The most common use is to set telnet & ftp control connections to
  "Minimum Delay" and FTP data to "Maximum Throughput".  This would be
  done as follows:



       ipchains -A output -p tcp -d 0.0.0.0/0 telnet -t 0x01 0x10
       ipchains -A output -p tcp -d 0.0.0.0/0 ftp -t 0x01 0x10
       ipchains -A output -p tcp -s 0.0.0.0/0 ftp-data -t 0x01 0x08



  The `-t' flag takes two extra parameters, both in hexadecimal.  These
  allow complex twiddling of the TOS bits: the first mask is ANDed with
  the packet's current TOS, and then the second mask is XORed with it.
  If this is too confusing, just use the following table:



       TOS Name                Value           Typical Uses

       Minimum Delay           0x01 0x10       ftp, telnet
       Maximum Throughput      0x01 0x08       ftp-data
       Maximum Reliability     0x01 0x04       snmp
       Minimum Cost            0x01 0x02       nntp



  Andi Kleen goes on to point out the following (mildly edited for
  posterity):

       Maybe it would be useful to add an reference to the txqueue­
       len parameter of ifconfig to the discussion of TOS bits. The
       default device queue length is tuned for ethernet cards, on
       modems it is too long and makes the 3 band scheduler (which
       queues based on TOS) work suboptimally. It is a good idea to
       set it to a value between 4-10 on modem or single b channel
       ISDN links: on bundled devices a longer queue is needed.
       This is a 2.0 and 2.1 problem, but in 2.1 it is a ifconfig
       flag (with recent nettools), while in 2.0 it requires source
       patches in the device drivers to change.


  So, to see maximal benifits of TOS manipulation for modem PPP links,
  do `ifconfig $1 txqueuelen' in your /etc/ppp/ip-up script.  The number
  to use depends on the modem speed and the amount of buffering in the
  modem; here's Andi setting me straight again:

       The best value for a given configuration needs experiment.
       If the queues are too short on a router then packets will
       get dropped.  Also of course one gets benefits even without
       TOS rewriting, just that TOS rewriting helps to give the
       benefits to non cooperating programs (but all standard linux
       programs are cooperating).



  4.1.5.4.  Marking a Packet

  This allows complex and powerful interactions with Alexey Kuznetsov's
  new Quality of Service implementation, as well as the mark-based
  forwarding in later 2.1 series kernels.  More news as it comes to
  hand.  This option is ignored altogether in the 2.0 kernel series.


  4.1.5.5.  Operations on an Entire Chain

  A very useful feature of ipchains is the ability to group related
  rules into chains.  You can call the chains whatever you want, as long
  as the names don't clash with the built-in chains (input, output and
  forward) or the targets (MASQ, REDIRECT, ACCEPT, DENY, REJECT or
  RETURN).  I suggest avoiding upper-case labels entirely, since I may
  use these for future extensions.  The chain name can be up to 8
  characters long.


  4.1.5.6.  Creating a New Chain

  Let's create a new chain.  Because I am such an imaginative fellow,
  I'll call it test.



       # ipchains -N test
       #



  It's that simple.  Now you can put rules in it as detailed above.


  4.1.5.7.  Deleting a Chain

  Deleting a chain is simple as well.



       # ipchains -X test
       #



  Why `-X'?  Well, all the good letters were taken.


  There are a couple of restrictions to deleting chains: they must be
  empty (see ``Flushing a Chain'' below) and they must not be the target
  of any rule.  You can't delete any of the three built-in chains.



  4.1.5.8.  Flushing a Chain

  There is a simple way of emptying all rules out of a chain, using the
  `-F' command.



               # ipchains -F forward
               #



  If you don't specify a chain, then all chains will be flushed.


  4.1.5.9.  Listing a Chain

  You can list all the rules in a chain by using the `-L' command.



       # ipchains -L input
       Chain input (refcnt = 1): (policy ACCEPT)
       target     prot opt    source                destination           ports
       ACCEPT     icmp -----  anywhere              anywhere              any
       # ipchains -L test
       Chain test (refcnt = 0):
       target     prot opt    source                destination           ports
       DENY       icmp -----  localnet/24           anywhere              any
       #



  The `refcnt' listed for test is the number of rules which have test as
  their target.  This must be zero (and the chain be empty) before this
  chain can be deleted.


  If the chain name is omitted, all chains are listed, even empty ones.


  There are three options which can accompany `-L'.  The `-n' (numeric)
  option is very useful as it prevents ipchains from trying to lookup
  the IP addresses, which (if you are using DNS like most people) will
  cause large delays if your DNS is not set up properly, or you have
  filtered out DNS requests.  It also causes ports to be printed out as
  numbers rather than names.


  The `-v' options shows you all the details of the rules, such as the
  the packet and byte counters, the TOS masks, the interface, and the
  packet mark.  Otherwise these values are omitted.  For example:



       # ipchains -v -L input
       Chain input (refcnt = 1): (policy ACCEPT)
        pkts bytes target     prot opt   tosa tosx  ifname    mark        source                destination           ports
          10   840 ACCEPT     icmp ----- 0xFF 0x00  lo                    anywhere              anywhere              any



  Note that the packet and byte counters are printed out using the
  suffixes `K', `M' or `G' for 1000, 1,000,000 and 1,000,000,000
  respectively.  Using the `-x' (expand numbers) flag as well prints the
  full numbers, no matter how large they are.


  4.1.5.10.  Resetting (Zeroing) Counters

  It is useful to be able to reset the counters.  This can be done with
  the `-Z' (zero counters) option.  For example:



       # ipchains -v -L input
       Chain input (refcnt = 1): (policy ACCEPT)
        pkts bytes target     prot opt   tosa tosx  ifname    mark        source                destination           ports
          10   840 ACCEPT     icmp ----- 0xFF 0x00  lo                    anywhere              anywhere              any
       # ipchains -Z input
       # ipchains -v -L input
       Chain input (refcnt = 1): (policy ACCEPT)
        pkts bytes target     prot opt   tosa tosx  ifname    mark        source                destination           ports
           0     0 ACCEPT     icmp ----- 0xFF 0x00  lo                    anywhere              anywhere              any
       #



  The problem with this approach is that sometimes you need to know the
  counter values immediately before they are reset.  In the above
  example, some packets could pass through between the `-L' and `-Z'
  commands.  For this reason, you can use the `-L' and `-Z' together, to
  reset the counters while reading them.  Unfortunately, if you do this,
  you can't operate on a single chain: you have to list and zero all the
  chains at once.



       # ipchains -L -v -Z
       Chain input (policy ACCEPT):
        pkts bytes target     prot opt   tosa tosx  ifname    mark        source                destination           ports
          10   840 ACCEPT     icmp ----- 0xFF 0x00  lo                    anywhere              anywhere              any

       Chain forward (refcnt = 1): (policy ACCEPT)
       Chain output (refcnt = 1): (policy ACCEPT)
       Chain test (refcnt = 0):
           0     0 DENY       icmp ----- 0xFF 0x00  ppp0                  localnet/24           anywhere              any

  4.1.5.11.  Setting Policy

  We glossed over what happens when a packet hits the end of a built-in
  chain when we discussed how a packet walks through chains in
  ``Specifying a Target'' above.  In this case, the policy of the chain
  determines the fate of the packet.  Only built-in chains (input,
  output and forward) have policies, because if a packet falls off the
  end of a user-defined chain, traversal resumes at the previous chain.


  The policy can be any of the first four special targets: ACCEPT, DENY,
  REJECT or MASQ.  MASQ is only valid for the `forward' chain.


  It is also important to note that a RETURN target in a rule in one of
  the built-in chains is useful to explicitly target the chain policy
  when a packet matches a rule.


  4.1.6.  Operations on Masquerading

  There are several parameters you can tweak for IP Masquerading.  They
  are bundled with ipchains because it's not worth writing a separate
  tool for them (although this will change).


  The IP Masquerading command is `-M', and it can be combined with `-L'
  to list currently masqueraded connections, or `-S' to set the
  masquerading parameters.


  The `-L' command can be accompanied by `-n' (show numbers instead of
  hostnames and port names) or `-v' (show deltas in sequence numbers for
  masqueraded connection, just in case you care).


  The `-S' command should be followed by three timeout values, each in
  seconds: for TCP sessions, for TCP sessions after a FIN packet, and
  for UDP packets.  If you don't want to change one of these values,
  simply give a value of `0'.


  The default values are listed in
  `/usr/src/linux/include/net/ip_masq.h', currently 15 minutes, 2
  minutes and 5 minutes respectively.


  The most common value to change is the first one, for FTP (see ``FTP
  Nightmares'' below).


  Note the problems with setting timeouts listed in ``I can't set
  masquerading timeouts!''.


  4.1.7.  Checking a Packet

  Sometimes you want to see what happens when a certain packet enters
  your machine, such as for debugging your firewall chains.  ipchains
  has the `-C' command to allow this, using the exact same routines that
  the kernel uses to diagnose real packets.


  You specify which chain to test the packet on by following the `-C'
  argument with its name.  Whereas the kernel always starts traversing
  on the input, output or forward chains, you are allowed to begin
  traversing on any chain for testing purposes.



  The details of the `packet' are specified using the same syntax used
  to specify firewall rules.  In particular, a protocol (`-p'), source
  address (`-s'), destination address (`-d') and interface (`-i') are
  compulsory.  If the protocol is TCP or UDP, then a single source and a
  single destination port must be specified, and a ICMP type and code
  must be specified for the ICMP protocol (unless the `-f' flag is
  specified to indicate a fragment rule, in which case these options are
  illegal).


  If the protocol is TCP (and the `-f' flag is not specified), the `-y'
  flag may be specified, to indicate that the test packet should have
  the SYN bit set.


  Here is an example of testing a TCP SYN packet from 192.168.1.1 port
  60000 to 192.168.1.2 port www, coming in the eth0 interface, entering
  the `input' chain.  (This is a classic incoming WWW connection
  initiation):



       # ipchains -C input -p tcp -y -i eth0 -s 192.168.1.1 60000 -d 192.168.1.2 www
       packet accepted
       #



  4.1.8.  Multiple Rules at Once and Watching What Happens

  Sometimes a single command line can result in multiple rules being
  effected.  This is done in two ways.  Firstly, if you specify a
  hostname which resolves (using DNS) to multiple IP addresses, ipchains
  will act as if you had typed multiple commands with each combination
  of addresses.


  So if the hostname `www.foo.com' resolves to three IP addresses, and
  the hostname `www.bar.com' resolves to two IP addresses, then the
  command `ipchains -A input -j reject -s www.bar.com -d www.foo.com'
  would append six rules to the input chain.


  The other way to have ipchains perform multiple actions is to use the
  bidirectional flag (`-b').  This flag makes ipchains behave as if you
  had typed the command twice, the second time with the `-s' and `-d'
  arguments reversed.  So, to avoid forwarding either to or from
  192.168.1.1, you could do the following:



       # ipchains -b -A forward -j reject -s 192.168.1.1
       #



  Personally, I don't like the `-b' option much; if you want
  convenience, see ``Using ipchains-save'' below.


  The -b option can be used with the insert (`-I'), delete (`-D') (but
  not the variation which takes a rule number), append (`-A') and check
  (`-C') commands.


  Another useful flag is `-v' (verbose) which prints out exactly what
  ipchains is doing with your commands.  This is useful if you are
  dealing with commands that may effect multiple rules.  For example,
  here we check the behaviour of fragments between 192.168.1.1 and
  192.168.1.2.



       # ipchains -v -b -C input -p tcp -f -s 192.168.1.1 -d 192.168.1.2 -i lo
         tcp opt   ---f- tos 0xFF 0x00  via lo    192.168.1.1  -> 192.168.1.2    * ->   *
       packet accepted
         tcp opt   ---f- tos 0xFF 0x00  via lo    192.168.1.2  -> 192.168.1.1    * ->   *
       packet accepted
       #



  4.2.  Useful Examples

  I have a dialup PPP connection (-i ppp0).  I grab news (-p TCP -s
  news.virtual.net.au nntp) and mail (-p TCP -s mail.virtual.net.au
  pop-3) every time I dial up.  I use Debian's FTP method to update my
  machine regularly (-p TCP -y -s ftp.debian.org.au ftp-data).  I surf
  the web through my ISP's proxy while this is going on (-p TCP -d
  proxy.virtual.net.au 8080), but hate the ads from doubleclick.net on
  the Dilbert Archive (-p TCP -y -d 199.95.207.0/24 and -p TCP -y -d
  199.95.208.0/24).


  I don't mind people trying to ftp to my machine while I'm online (-p
  TCP -d $LOCALIP ftp), but don't want anyone outside pretending to have
  an IP address of my internal network (-s 192.168.1.0/24).  This is
  commonly called IP spoofing, and there is a better way to protect
  yourself from it in the 2.1.x kernels and above: see ``How do I set up
  IP spoof protection?''.


  This setup is fairly simple, because there are currently no other
  boxes on my internal network.


  I don't want any local process (ie. Netscape, lynx etc.) to connect to
  doubleclick.net:



       # ipchains -A output -d 199.95.207.0/24 -j REJECT
       # ipchains -A output -d 199.95.208.0/24 -j REJECT
       #



  Now I want to set priorities on various outgoing packets (there isn't
  much point in doing it on incoming packets).  Since I have a fair
  number of these rules, it makes sense to put them all in a single
  chain, called ppp-out.



  # ipchains -N ppp-out
  # ipchains -A output -i ppp0 -j ppp-out
  #



  Minimum delay for web traffic & telnet.



       # ipchains -A ppp-out -p TCP -d proxy.virtual.net.au 8080 -t 0x01 0x10
       # ipchains -A ppp-out -p TCP -d 0.0.0.0/0 telnet -t 0x01 0x10
       #



  Low cost for ftp data, nntp, pop-3:



       # ipchains -A ppp-out -p TCP -d 0.0.0.0/0 ftp-data -t 0x01 0x02
       # ipchains -A ppp-out -p TCP -d 0.0.0.0/0 nntp -t 0x01 0x02
       # ipchains -A ppp-out -p TCP -d 0.0.0.0/0 pop-3 -t 0x01 0x02
       #



  There are a few restrictions on packets coming in the ppp0 interface:
  let's create a chain called `ppp-in':



       # ipchains -N ppp-in
       # ipchains -A input -i ppp0 -j ppp-in
       #



  Now, no packets coming in ppp0 should be claiming a source address of
  192.168.1.*, so we log and deny them:



       # ipchains -A ppp-in -s 192.168.1.0/24 -l -j DENY
       #



  I allow UDP packets in for DNS (I run a caching nameserver which
  forwards all requests to 203.29.16.1, so I expect DNS replies from
  them only), incoming ftp, and return ftp-data only (which should only
  be going to a port above 1023, and not the X11 ports around 6000).



  # ipchains -A ppp-in -p UDP -s 203.29.16.1 -d $LOCALIP dns -j ACCEPT
  # ipchains -A ppp-in -p TCP -s 0.0.0.0/0 ftp-data -d $LOCALIP 1024:5999 -j ACCEPT
  # ipchains -A ppp-in -p TCP -s 0.0.0.0/0 ftp-data -d $LOCALIP 6010: -j ACCEPT
  # ipchains -A ppp-in -p TCP -d $LOCALIP ftp -j ACCEPT
  #



  I allow TCP reply packets back in



       # ipchains -A ppp-in -p TCP ! -y -j ACCEPT
       #



  Finally, local-to-local packets are OK:



       # ipchains -A input -i lo -j ACCEPT
       #



  Now, my default policy on the input chain is DENY, so everything else
  gets dropped:



       # ipchains -P input DENY
       #



  NOTE: I wouldn't set up my chains in this order, as packets might get
  through while I'm setting up.  Safest is usually to set the policy to
  DENY first, then insert the rules.  Of course, if your rules require
  DNS lookups to resolve hostnames, you could be in trouble.


  4.2.1.  Using ipchains-save

  Setting up firewall chains just the way you want them, and then trying
  to remember the commands you used so you can do them next time is a
  pain.


  So, ipchains-save is a script which reads your current chains setup
  and saves it to a file.  For the moment I'll keep you in suspense with
  regards to what ipchains-restore does.


  ipchains-save can save a single chain, or all chains (if no chain name
  is specified).  The only option currently permitted is `-v' which
  prints the rules (to stderr) as they are saved.  The policy of the
  chain is also saved for input, output and forward chains.
       # ipchains-save > my_firewall
       Saving `input'.
       Saving `output'.
       Saving `forward'.
       Saving `ppp-in'.
       Saving `ppp-out'.
       #



  4.2.2.  Using ipchains-restore

  ipchains-restore restores chains as saved with ipchains-save.  It can
  take two options: `-v' which describes each rule as it is added, and
  `-f' which forces flushing of user-defined chains if they exist, as
  described below.


  If a user-defined chain is found in the input, ipchains-restore checks
  if that chain already exists.  If it does, then you will be prompted
  whether the chains should be flushed (cleared of all rules) or whether
  restoring this chain should be skipped.  If you specified `-f' on the
  command line, you will not be prompted; the chain will be flushed.


  For example:



       # ipchains-restore < my_firewall
       Restoring `input'.
       Restoring `output'.
       Restoring `forward'.
       Restoring `ppp-in'.
       Chain `ppp-in' already exists. Skip or flush? [S/f]? s
       Skipping `ppp-in'.
       Restoring `ppp-out'.
       Chain `ppp-out' already exists. Skip or flush? [S/f]? f
       Flushing `ppp-out'.
       #



  5.  Miscellaneous.

  This section contains all the information and FAQs that I couldn't fit
  inside the structure above.


  5.1.  How to Organize Your Firewall Rules

  This question requires some thought.  You can try to organize them to
  optimize speed (minimize the number of rule-checks for the most common
  packets) or to increase manageability.


  If you have an intermittent link, say a PPP link, you might want to
  set the first rule in the input chain to be set to `-i ppp0 -j DENY'
  at boot time, then have something like this in your ip-up script:



  # Re-create the `ppp-in' chain.
  ipchains-restore -f < ppp-in.firewall

  # Replace DENY rule with jump to ppp-handling chain.
  ipchains -R input 1 -i ppp0 -j ppp-in



  Your ip-down script would look like:



       ipchains -R input 1 -i ppp0 -j DENY



  5.2.  What Not To Filter Out

  There are some things you should be aware of before you start
  filtering out everything you don't want.


  5.2.1.  ICMP packets

  ICMP packets are used (among other things) to indicate failure for
  other protocols (such as TCP and UDP).  `destination-unreachable'
  packets in particular.  Blocking these packets means that you will
  never get `Host unreachable' or `No route to host' errors; any
  connections will just wait for a reply that never comes.  This is
  irritating, but rarely fatal.


  A worse problem is the role of ICMP packets in MTU discovery.  All
  good TCP implementations (Linux included) use MTU discovery to try to
  figure out what the largest packet that can get to a destination
  without being fragmented (fragmentation slows performance, especially
  when occasional fragments are lost).  MTU discovery works by sending
  packets with the "Don't Fragment" bit set, and then sending smaller
  packets if it gets an ICMP packet indicating "Fragmentation needed but
  DF set" (`fragmentation-needed').  This is a type of `destination-
  unreachable' packet, and if it is never received, the local host will
  not reduce MTU, and performance will be abysmal or non-existent.


  Note that it is common to block all ICMP redirect messages (type 5);
  these can be used to manipulate routing (although good IP stacks have
  safeguards), and so are often seen as slightly risky.


  5.2.2.  TCP Connections to DNS (nameservers)

  If you're trying to block outgoing TCP connections, remember that DNS
  doesn't always use UDP; if the reply from the server exceeds 512
  bytes, the client uses a TCP connection (still going to port number
  53) to get the data.


  This can be a trap because DNS will `mostly work' if you disallow such
  TCP transfers; you may experience strange long delays and other
  occasional DNS problems if you do.

  If your DNS queries are always directed at the same external source
  (either directly by using the nameserver line in /etc/resolv.conf or
  by using a caching nameserver in forward mode), then you need only
  allow TCP connections to port domain on that nameserver from the local
  domain port (if using a caching nameserver) or from a high port (>
  1023) if using /etc/resolv.conf.


  5.2.3.  FTP Nightmares

  The classic packet filtering problem is FTP.  FTP has two modes; the
  traditional one is called active mode and the more recent one is
  called passive mode.  Web browsers usually default to passive mode,
  but command-line FTP programs usually default to active mode.


  In active mode, when the remote end wants to send a file (or even the
  results of an ls or dir command) it tries to open a TCP connection to
  the local machine.  This means you can't filter out these TCP
  connections without breaking active FTP.


  If you have the option of using passive mode, then fine; passive mode
  makes data connections from client to server, even for incoming data.
  Otherwise, it is recommended that you only allow TCP connections to
  ports above 1024 and not between 6000 and 6010 (6000 is used for X-
  Windows).


  5.3.  Filtering out Ping of Death

  Linux boxes are now immune to the famous Ping of Death, which involves
  sending an illegally-large ICMP packet which overflows buffers in the
  TCP stack on the receiver and causes havoc.


  If you are protecting boxes which might be vulnerable, you could
  simply block ICMP fragments.  Normal ICMP packets aren't large enough
  to require fragmentation, so you won't break anything except big
  pings.  I have heard (unconfirmed) reports that some systems required
  only the last fragment of an oversize ICMP packet to corrupt them, so
  blocking only the first fragment is not recommended.


  While the exploit programs I have seen all use ICMP, there is no
  reasons that TCP or UDP fragments (or an unknown protocol) could not
  be used for this attack, so blocking ICMP fragments is only a
  temporary solution.


  5.4.  Filtering out Teardrop and Bonk

  Teardrop and Bonk are two attacks (mainly against Microsoft Windows NT
  machines) which rely on overlapping fragments.  Having your Linux
  router do defragmentation, or disallowing all fragments to your
  vulnerable machines are the other options.


  5.5.  Filtering out Fragment Bombs

  Some less-reliable TCP stacks are said to have problems dealing with
  large numbers of fragments of packets when they don't receive all the
  fragments.  Linux does not have this problem.  You can filter out
  fragments (which might break legitimate uses) or compile your kernel
  with `IP: always defragment' set to `Y' (only if your Linux box is the
  only possible route for these packets).
  5.6.  Changing Firewall Rules

  There are some timing issues involved in altering firewall rules.  If
  you are not careful, you can let packets through while you are half-
  way through your changes.  A simplistic approach is to do the
  following:



       # ipchains -I input 1 -j DENY
       # ipchains -I output 1 -j DENY
       # ipchains -I forward 1 -j DENY

       ... make changes ...

       # ipchains -D input 1
       # ipchains -D output 1
       # ipchains -D forward 1
       #



  This drops all packets for the duration of the changes.


  If your changes are restricted to a single chain, you might want to
  create a new chain with the new rules, and then replace (`-R') the
  rule that pointed to the old chain with one that points to the new
  chain: then you can delete the old chain.  This replacement will occur
  atomically.


  5.7.  How Do I Set Up IP Spoof Protection?

  IP spoofing is a technique where a host sends out packets which claim
  to be from another host.  Since packet filtering makes decisions based
  on this source address, IP spoofing is uses to fool packet filters.
  It is also used to hide the identity of attackers using SYN attacks,
  Teardrop, Ping of Death and the like (don't worry if you don't know
  what they are).


  The best way to protect from IP spoofing is called Source Address
  Verification, and it is done by the routing code, and not firewalling
  at all.  Look for a file called /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/rp_filter.
  If this exists, then turning on Source Address Verification at every
  boot is the right solution for you.  To do that, insert the following
  lines somewhere in your init scripts, before any network interfaces
  are initialized:



  # This is the best method: turn on Source Address Verification and get
  # spoof protection on all current and future interfaces.
  if [ -e /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/rp_filter ]; then
    echo -n "Setting up IP spoofing protection..."
    for f in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/rp_filter; do
        echo 1 > $f
    done
    echo "done."
  else
    echo PROBLEMS SETTING UP IP SPOOFING PROTECTION.  BE WORRIED.
    echo "CONTROL-D will exit from this shell and continue system startup."
    echo
    # Start a single user shell on the console
    /sbin/sulogin $CONSOLE
  fi



  If you cannot do this, you can manually insert rules to protect every
  interface.  This requires knowledge of each interface.  The 2.1
  kernels automatically reject packets claiming to come from the 127.*
  addresses (reserved for the local loopback interface, lo).


  For example, say we have three interfaces, eth0, eth1 and ppp0.  We
  can use ifconfig to tell us the address and netmask of the interfaces.
  Say eth0 was attached to a network 192.168.1.0 with netmask
  255.255.255.0, eth1 was attached to a network 10.0.0.0 with netmask
  255.0.0.0, and ppp0 connected to the Internet (where any address
  except the reserved private IP addresses are allowed), we would insert
  the following rules:



       # ipchains -A input -i eth0 -s ! 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0 -j DENY
       # ipchains -A input -i ! eth0 -s 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0 -j DENY
       # ipchains -A input -i eth1 -s ! 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 -j DENY
       # ipchains -A input -i ! eth1 -s 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 -j DENY
       #



  This approach is not as good as the Source Address Verification
  approach, because if your network changes, you have to change your
  firewalling rules to keep up.


  If you are running a 2.0 series kernel, you might want to protect the
  loopback interface as well, using a rule like this:



       # ipchains -A input -i ! lo -s 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 -j DENY
       #



  5.8.  Advanced Projects

  There is a userspace library I have written which is included with the
  source distribution called `libfw'.  It uses the ability of IP Chains
  1.3 and above to copy a packet to userspace (using the
  IP_FIREWALL_NETLINK config option).


  The mark value can be used to specify the Quality of Service
  parameters for packets, or to specify how packets should be port-
  forwarded.  I've never used either, but if you want to write about it,
  please contact me.


  Things such as stateful inspection (I prefer the term dynamic
  firewalling) can be implemented in userspace using this library.
  Other nifty ideas include controlling packets on a per-user basis by
  doing a lookup in a userspace daemon.  This should be pretty easy.


  5.8.1.  SPF: Stateful Packet Filtering

  ftp://ftp.interlinx.bc.ca/pub/spf <ftp://ftp.interlinx.bc.ca/pub/spf>
  is the site of Brian Murrell's SPF project, which does connection
  tracking in userspace.  It adds significant security for low-bandwidth
  sites.


  There's little documentation at present, but here's a post to the
  mailing list in which Brian answered some questions:



       > I believe it does exactly what I want: Installing a temporary
       > "backward"-rule to let packets in as a response to an
       > outgoing request.

       Yup, that is exactly what it does.  The more protocols it
       understands, the more "backward" rules it gets right.  Right
       now it has support for (from memory, please excuse any errors
       or omissions) FTP (both active and passive, in and out), some
       RealAudio, traceroute, ICMP and basic ICQ (inbound from the ICQ
       servers, and direct TCP connections, but alas the secondary
       direct TCP connections for things like file transfer, etc. are
       not there yet)

       > Is it a replacement for ipchains or a supplement?

       It is a supplement.  Think of ipchains as the engine to allow
       and prevent packets from travelling across a Linux box.  SPF is
       the driver, constantly monitoring traffic and telling ipchains
       how to change it's policies to reflect the changes in traffic
       patterns.



  5.8.2.  Michael Hasenstein's ftp-data hack

  Michael Hasenstein of SuSE has written a kernel patch which adds ftp
  connection tracking to ipchains.  It can currently be found at
  http://www.suse.de/~mha/patch.ftp-data-2.gz
  <http://www.suse.de/~mha/patch.ftp-data-2.gz>

  5.9.  Future Enhancements

  Firewalling and NAT have being redesigned for 2.4.  Plans and
  discussions are available on the netfilter list (see
  http://lists.samba.org <http://lists.samba.org>).  These enhancements
  should clear up many outstanding usability issues (really, firewalling
  and masquerading shouldn't be this hard), and allow growth for far
  more flexible firewalling.


  6.  Common Problems


  6.1.  ipchains -L Freezes!

  You're probably blocking DNS lookups; it will eventually time out.
  Try using the `-n' (numeric) flag to ipchains, which suppresses the
  lookup of names.



  6.2.  Inverse doesn't work!

  You must put the `!' option by itself, with spaces either side.  A
  classic mistake (warned about in 1.3.10) is:



       # ipchains -A input -i !eth0 -j DENY
       #



  There will never be an interface called `!eth0', but ipchains doesn't
  know that.



  6.3.  Masquerading/Forwarding Doesn't Work!

  Make sure that packet forwarding is enabled (in recent kernels it is
  disabled by default, meaning that packets never even try to traverse
  the `forward' chain).  You can override this (as root) by typing



       # echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
       #



  If this works for you, you can put this somewhere in your bootup
  scripts so it is enabled every time; you'll want to set up your
  firewalling before this command runs though, otherwise there's an
  opportunity for packets to slip through.



  6.4.  -j REDIR doesn't work!

  You must allow forwarding packets (see above) for redirect to work;
  otherwise the routing code drops the packet.  So if you are just using
  redirect, and don't have any forwarding at all, you should be aware of
  that.


  Note that REDIR (being in the input chain) doesn't effect connections
  from a local process.


  6.5.  Wildcard Interfaces Don't Work!

  There was a bug in versions 2.1.102 and 2.1.103 of the kernel (and
  some old patches I produced) which made ipchains commands which
  specified a wildcard interface (such as -i ppp+) fail.


  This is fixed in recent kernels, and in the 2.0.34 patch on the web
  site.  You can also fix it by hand in the kernel source by changing
  line 63 or so in include/linux/ip_fw.h:



       #define IP_FW_F_MASK    0x002F  /* All possible flag bits mask   */



  This should read ``0x003F''.  Fix this and recompile the kernel.


  6.6.  TOS Doesn't Work!

  This was my mistake: setting the Type of Service field did not
  actually set the Type of Service in kernel versions 2.1.102 through
  2.1.111.  This problem was fixed in 2.1.112.


  6.7.  ipautofw and ipportfw Don't Work!

  For 2.0.x, this is true; I haven't time to create and maintain a jumbo
  patch for ipchains and ipautofw/ipportfw.


  For 2.1.x, download Juan Ciarlante's ipmasqadm from

  <url url="http://juanjox.linuxhq.com/"
          name="http://juanjox.linuxhq.com/">


  and use it exactly as you would have used ipautofw or ipportfw, except
  instead of ipportfw you type ipmasqadm portfw, and instead of ipautofw
  you type ipmasqadm autofw.


  6.8.  xosview is Broken!

  Upgrade to version 1.6.0 or above, which doesn't require any firewall
  rules at all for 2.1.x kernels.  This seems to have broken again in
  the 1.6.1 release; please bug the author (it's not my fault!).


  6.9.  Segmentation Fault With `-j REDIRECT'!

  This was a bug in ipchains version 1.3.3.  Please upgrade.



  6.10.  I Can't Set Masquerading Timeouts!

  True (for 2.1.x kernels) up to 2.1.123.  In 2.1.124, trying to set the
  masquerading timeouts causes a kernel lockup (change return to ret =
  on line 1328 of net/ipv4/ip_fw.c).  In 2.1.125, it works fine.


  6.11.  I Want to Firewall IPX!

  So do a number of others, it seems.  My code only covers IP,
  unfortunately.  On the good side, all the hooks are there to firewall
  IPX!  You just need to write the code; I will happily help where
  possible.


  7.  A Serious Example.

  This example was extracted from Michael Neuling and my March 1999
  LinuxWorld Tutorial; this is not the only way to solve the given
  problem, but it is probably the simplest.  I hope you will find it
  informative.



  7.1.  The Arrangement


  ·  Masqueraded internal network (various operating systems), which we
     call "GOOD".

  ·  Exposed servers in a separate network (called "DMZ" for
     Demilitarized Zone).

  ·  PPP Connection to the Internet (called "BAD").



          External Network (BAD)

                  |
          Internal Network (GOOD)



  7.2.  Goals


  Packet Filter box:


      PING any network
        This is really useful to tell if a machine is down.


      TRACEROUTE any network
        Once again, useful for diagnosis.


      Access DNS
        To make ping and DNS more useful.



  Within the DMZ:


  Mail server

  ·  SMTP to external

  ·  Accept SMTP from internal and external

  ·  Accept POP-3 from internal

  Name Server

  ·  Send DNS to external

  ·  Accept DNS from internal, external and packet filter box


  Web server

  ·  Accept HTTP from internal and external

  ·  Rsync access from internal


  Internal:

     Allow WWW, ftp, traceroute, ssh to external
        These are fairly standard things to allow: some places start by
        allowing the internal machines to do just about everything, but
        here we're being restrictive.


      Allow SMTP to Mail server
        Obviously, we want them to be able to send mail out.


      Allow POP-3 to Mail server
        This is how they read their mail.


      Allow DNS to Name server
        They need to be able to look up external names for WWW, ftp,
        traceroute and ssh.


      Allow rsync to Web server
        This is how they synchronize the external web server with the
        internal one.


      Allow WWW to Web server
        Obviously, they should be able to connect to our external web
        server.


      Allow ping to packet filter box
        This is a courteous thing to allow: it means that they can test
        if the firewall box is down (so we don't get blamed if an
        external site is broken).



  7.3.  Before Packet Filtering


  ·  Anti-spoofing


     Since we don't have any asymmetric routing, we can simply turn on
     anti-spoofing for all interfaces.



       # for f in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/rp_filter; do echo 1 > $f; done
       #



  ·  Set filtering rules to DENY all:


     We still allow local loopback traffic, but deny anything else.



       # ipchains -A input -i ! lo -j DENY
       # ipchains -A output -i ! lo -j DENY
       # ipchains -A forward -j DENY
       #



  ·  Set Up Interfaces


     This is usually done in the boot scripts.  Make sure the above
     steps are done before the interfaces are configured, to prevent
     packet leakage before the rules are set up.


  ·  Insert per-protocol masquerading modules.

     We need to insert the masquerading module for FTP, so that active
     and passive FTP `just work' from the internal network.



       # insmod ip_masq_ftp
       #


  7.4.  Packet Filtering for Through Packets

  With masquerading, it's best to filter in the forward chain.


  Split forward chain into various user chains depending on source/dest
  interfaces; this breaks the problem down into managable chunks.



       ipchains -N good-dmz
       ipchains -N bad-dmz
       ipchains -N good-bad
       ipchains -N dmz-good
       ipchains -N dmz-bad
       ipchains -N bad-good



  ACCEPTing standard error ICMPs is a common thing to do, so we create a
  chain for it.



       ipchains -N icmp-acc



  7.4.1.  Set Up Jumps From forward Chain

  Unfortunately, we only know (in the forward chain) the outgoing
  interface.  Thus, to figure out what interface the packet came in on,
  we use the source address (the anti-spoofing prevents address faking).


  Note that we log anything which doesn't match any of these (obviously,
  this should never happen).



       ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.1.0/24 -i eth0 -j good-dmz
       ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.1.0/24 -i ppp0 -j good-bad
       ipchains -A forward -s 192.84.219.0/24 -i ppp0 -j dmz-bad
       ipchains -A forward -s 192.84.219.0/24 -i eth1 -j dmz-good
       ipchains -A forward -i eth0 -j bad-dmz
       ipchains -A forward -i eth1 -j bad-good
       ipchains -A forward -j DENY -l



  7.4.2.  Define the icmp-acc Chain

  Packets which are one of the error ICMPs get ACCEPTed, otherwise,
  control will pass back to the calling chain.



  ipchains -A icmp-acc -p icmp --icmp-type destination-unreachable -j ACCEPT
  ipchains -A icmp-acc -p icmp --icmp-type source-quench -j ACCEPT
  ipchains -A icmp-acc -p icmp --icmp-type time-exceeded -j ACCEPT
  ipchains -A icmp-acc -p icmp --icmp-type parameter-problem -j ACCEPT



  7.4.3.  Good (Internal) to DMZ (Servers)

  Internal restrictions:

  ·  Allow WWW, ftp, traceroute, ssh to external

  ·  Allow SMTP to Mail server

  ·  Allow POP-3 to Mail server

  ·  Allow DNS to Name server

  ·  Allow rsync to Web server

  ·  Allow WWW to Web server

  ·  Allow ping to packet filter box

  Could do masquerading from internal network into DMZ, but here we
  don't.  Since noone in the internal network should be trying to do
  evil things, we log any packets that get denied.


  Note that old versions of Debian called `pop3' `pop-3' in
  /etc/services, which disagrees with RFC1700.



       ipchains -A good-dmz -p tcp -d 192.84.219.128 smtp -j ACCEPT
       ipchains -A good-dmz -p tcp -d 192.84.219.128 pop3 -j ACCEPT
       ipchains -A good-dmz -p udp -d 192.84.219.129 domain -j ACCEPT
       ipchains -A good-dmz -p tcp -d 192.84.219.129 domain -j ACCEPT
       ipchains -A good-dmz -p tcp -d 192.84.218.130 www -j ACCEPT
       ipchains -A good-dmz -p tcp -d 192.84.218.130 rsync -j ACCEPT
       ipchains -A good-dmz -p icmp -j icmp-acc
       ipchains -A good-dmz -j DENY -l



  7.4.4.  Bad (external) to DMZ (servers).



  ·  DMZ restrictions:

  ·  Mail server

  ·  SMTP to external

  ·  Accept SMTP from internal and external

  ·  Accept POP-3 from internal


  ·  Name server

  ·  Send DNS to external

  ·  Accept DNS from internal, external and packet filter box


  ·  Web server

  ·  Accept HTTP from internal and external

  ·  Rsync access from internal


  ·  Things we allow from external network to DMZ.

  ·  Don't log violations, as they may happen.



       ipchains -A bad-dmz -p tcp -d 192.84.219.128 smtp -j ACCEPT
       ipchains -A bad-dmz -p udp -d 192.84.219.129 domain -j ACCEPT
       ipchains -A bad-dmz -p tcp -d 192.84.219.129 domain -j ACCEPT
       ipchains -A bad-dmz -p tcp -d 192.84.218.130 www -j ACCEPT
       ipchains -A bad-dmz -p icmp -j icmp-acc
       ipchains -A bad-dmz -j DENY



  7.4.5.  Good (internal) to Bad (external).


  ·  Internal restrictions:

  ·  Allow WWW, ftp, traceroute, ssh to external

  ·  Allow SMTP to Mail server

  ·  Allow POP-3 to Mail server

  ·  Allow DNS to Name server

  ·  Allow rsync to Web server

  ·  Allow WWW to Web server

  ·  Allow ping to packet filter box

  ·  Many people allow everything from the internal to external
     networks, then add restrictions.  We're being fascist.

  ·  Log violations.

  ·  Passive FTP handled by masq. module.

  ·  UDP destination ports 33434 and up are used by traceroute.



  ipchains -A good-bad -p tcp --dport www -j MASQ
  ipchains -A good-bad -p tcp --dport ssh -j MASQ
  ipchains -A good-bad -p udp --dport 33434:33500 -j MASQ
  ipchains -A good-bad -p tcp --dport ftp -j MASQ
  ipchains -A good-bad -p icmp --icmp-type ping -j MASQ
  ipchains -A good-bad -j REJECT -l



  7.4.6.  DMZ to Good (internal).



  ·  Internal restrictions:

  ·  Allow WWW, ftp, traceroute, ssh to external

  ·  Allow SMTP to Mail server

  ·  Allow POP-3 to Mail server

  ·  Allow DNS to Name server

  ·  Allow rsync to Web server

  ·  Allow WWW to Web server

  ·  Allow ping to packet filter box


  ·  If we were masquerading from the internal network to the DMZ,
     simply refuse any packets coming the other way. As it is, only
     allow packets which might be part of an established connection.



       ipchains -A dmz-good -p tcp ! -y -s 192.84.219.128 smtp -j ACCEPT
       ipchains -A dmz-good -p udp -s 192.84.219.129 domain -j ACCEPT

       ipchains -A dmz-good -p icmp -j icmp-acc
       ipchains -A dmz-good -j DENY -l



  7.4.7.  DMZ to bad (external).



  ·  DMZ restrictions:

  ·  Mail server

  ·  SMTP to external

  ·  Accept SMTP from internal and external

  ·  Accept POP-3 from internal



  ·  Name server

  ·  Send DNS to external

  ·  Accept DNS from internal, external and packet filter box


  ·  Web server

  ·  Accept HTTP from internal and external

  ·  Rsync access from internal


  ·

       ipchains -A dmz-bad -p icmp -j icmp-acc
       ipchains -A dmz-bad -j DENY -l



  7.4.8.  Bad (external) to Good (internal).



  ·  We don't allow anything (non-masqueraded) from the external network
     to the internal network


       ipchains -A bad-good -j REJECT



  7.4.9.  Packet Filtering for the Linux Box Itself



  ·  If we want to use packet filtering on packets coming into the box
     itself, we need to do filtering in the input chain. We create one
     chain for each destination interface:


       ipchains -N bad-if
       ipchains -N dmz-if
       ipchains -N good-if



  ·  Create jumps to them:



  ipchains -A input -d 192.84.219.1 -j bad-if
  ipchains -A input -d 192.84.219.250 -j dmz-if
  ipchains -A input -d 192.168.1.250 -j good-if



  7.4.9.1.  Bad (external) interface.



  ·  Packet Filter box:

  ·  PING any network

  ·  TRACEROUTE any network

  ·  Access DNS


  ·  External interface also receives replies to masqueraded packets
     (masquerading uses source ports 61000 to 65095) and ICMP errors for
     them and PING replies.



       ipchains -A bad-if -i ! ppp0 -j DENY -l
       ipchains -A bad-if -p TCP --dport 61000:65095 -j ACCEPT
       ipchains -A bad-if -p UDP --dport 61000:65095 -j ACCEPT
       ipchains -A bad-if -p ICMP --icmp-type pong -j ACCEPT
       ipchains -A bad-if -j icmp-acc
       ipchains -A bad-if -j DENY



  7.4.9.2.  DMZ interface.



  ·  Packet Filter box restrictions:

  ·  PING any network

  ·  TRACEROUTE any network

  ·  Access DNS


  ·  DMZ interface receives DNS replies, ping replies and ICMP errors.



       ipchains -A dmz-if -i ! eth0 -j DENY
       ipchains -A dmz-if -p TCP ! -y -s 192.84.219.129 53 -j ACCEPT
       ipchains -A dmz-if -p UDP -s 192.84.219.129 53 -j ACCEPT
       ipchains -A dmz-if -p ICMP --icmp-type pong -j ACCEPT
       ipchains -A dmz-if -j icmp-acc
       ipchains -A dmz-if -j DENY -l



  7.4.9.3.  Good (internal) interface.



  ·  Packet Filter box restrictions:

  ·  PING any network

  ·  TRACEROUTE any network

  ·  Access DNS


  ·  Internal restrictions:

  ·  Allow WWW, ftp, traceroute, ssh to external

  ·  Allow SMTP to Mail server

  ·  Allow POP-3 to Mail server

  ·  Allow DNS to Name server

  ·  Allow rsync to Web server

  ·  Allow WWW to Web server

  ·  Allow ping to packet filter box


  ·  Internal interface receives pings, ping replies and ICMP errors.



       ipchains -A good-if -i ! eth1 -j DENY
       ipchains -A good-if -p ICMP --icmp-type ping -j ACCEPT
       ipchains -A good-if -p ICMP --icmp-type pong -j ACCEPT
       ipchains -A good-if -j icmp-acc
       ipchains -A good-if -j DENY -l



  7.5.  Finally


  ·  Delete blocking rules:


       ipchains -D input 1
       ipchains -D forward 1
       ipchains -D output 1



  8.  Appendix: Differences between ipchains and ipfwadm.

  Some of these changes are a result of kernel changes, and some a
  result of ipchains being different from ipfwadm.



  1. Many arguments have been remapped: capitals now indicates a
     command, and lower case now indicates an option.

  2. Arbitrary chains are supported, so even built-in chains have full
     names instead of flags (eg. `input' instead of `-I').

  3. The `-k' option has vanished: use `! -y'.

  4. The `-b' option actually inserts/appends/deletes two rules, rather
     than a single `bidirectional' rule.

  5. The `-b' option can be passed to `-C' to do two checks (one in each
     direction).

  6. The `-x' option to `-l' has been replaced by `-v'.

  7. Multiple source and destination ports are not supported anymore.
     Hopefully being able to negate the port range will somewhat make up
     for that.

  8. Interfaces can only be specified by name (not address).  The old
     semantics got silently changed in the 2.1 kernel series anyway.

  9. Fragments are examined, not automatically allowed through.

  10.
     Explicit accounting chains have been done away with.

  11.
     Arbitrary protocols over IP can be tested for.

  12.
     The old behavior of SYN and ACK matching (which was previously
     ignored for non-TCP packets) has changed; the SYN option is not
     valid for non-TCP-specific rules.

  13.
     Counters are now 64-bit on 32-bit machines, not 32-bit.

  14.
     Inverse options are now supported.

  15.
     ICMP codes are now supported.

  16.
     Wildcard interfaces are now supported.

  17.
     TOS manipulations are now sanity-checked: the old kernel code would
     silently stop you from (illegally) manipulating the `Must Be Zero'
     TOS bit; ipchains now returns an error if you try, as well as for
     other illegal cases.


  8.1.  Quick-Reference table.

  [ Mainly, command arguments are UPPER CASE, and option arguments are
  lower case ]


  One thing to note, masquerading is specified by `-j MASQ'; it is
  completely different from `-j ACCEPT', and not treated as merely a
  side-effect, unlike ipfwadm does.

  8.2.  Examples of translated ipfwadm commands

  Old command: ipfwadm -F  -p deny

  New command: ipchains -P forward DENY


  Old command: ipfwadm -F -a m -S 192.168.0.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0/0

  New command: ipchains -A forward -j MASQ -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d
  0.0.0.0/0


  Old command: ipfwadm -I -a accept -V 10.1.2.1 -S 10.0.0.0/8 -D
  0.0.0.0/0

  New command: ipchains -A input -j ACCEPT -i eth0 -s 10.0.0.0/8 -d
  0.0.0.0/0

  (Note that there is no equivalent for specifying interfaces by
  address: use the interface name.  On this machine, 10.1.2.1
  corresponds to eth0).


  9.  Appendix: Using the ipfwadm-wrapper script.

  The ipfwadm-wrapper shell script should be a plug-in replacement of
  ipfwadm for backwards compatibility with ipfwadm 2.3a.


  The only feature it can't really handle is the `-V' option.  When this
  is used, a warning is given.  If the `-W' option is also used, the
  `-V' option is ignored.  Otherwise, the script tries to find the
  interface name associated with that address, using ifconfig.  If that
  fails (such as for an interface which is down) then it will exit with
  an error message.


  This warning can be suppressed by either changing the `-V' to a `-W',
  or directing the standard output of the script to /dev/null.


  If you should find any mistakes in this script, or any changes between
  the real ipfwadm and this script, please report a bug to me: send an
  EMail to rusty@linuxcare.com with "BUG-REPORT" in the subject.  Please
  list your old version of ipfwadm (ipfwadm -h), your version of
  ipchains (ipchains --version), the version of the ipfwadm wrapper
  script (ipfwadm-wrapper --version).  Also send the output of ipchains-
  save.  Thanks in advance.


  Mix ipchains with this ipfwadm-wrapper script at your own peril.


  10.  Appendix: Thanks.

  Many thanks have to go to Michael Neuling, who wrote the first
  releasable cut of the IP chains code while working for me.  Public
  apologies for nixing his result-caching idea, which Alan Cox later
  proposed and I have finally begun implementing, having seen the error
  of my ways.


  Thanks to Alan Cox for his 24-hour EMail tech support, and
  encouragement.


  Thanks to all the authors of the ipfw and ipfwadm code, especially Jos
  Vos.  Standing on the shoulders of giants and all that...  This
  applies to Linus Torvalds and all the kernel and userspace hackers as
  well.


  Thanks to the diligent beta testers and bughunters, especially Jordan
  Mendelson, Shaw Carruthers, Kevin Moule, Dr. Liviu Daia, Helmut Adams,
  Franck Sicard, Kevin Littlejohn, Matt Kemner, John D. Hardin, Alexey
  Kuznetsov, Leos Bitto, Jim Kunzman, Gerard Gerritsen, Serge Sivkov,
  Andrew Burgess, Steve Schmidtke, Richard Offer, Bernhard Weisshuhn,
  Larry Auton, Ambrose Li, Pavel Krauz, Steve Chadsey, Francesco
  Potorti`, Alain Knaff, Casper Boden-Cummins and Henry Hollenberg.


  10.1.  Translations

  People who do translations should put themselves at the top of the
  Thanks page, like so: `Special thanks to XXX, for translating
  everything exactly from my English.'.  Then tell me about your
  translation so I can include it here.

Linux IP Masquerade HOWTO

David A. Ranch

<dranch@trinnet.net>

v2.00.110903, 2003-11-09


This document describes how to enable the Linux IP Masquerade feature on a
given Linux host. IP Masquerade is a form of Network Address Translation or
NAT which NAT allows internally connected computers that do not have one or
more registered Internet IP addresses to communicate to the Internet via the
Linux server's Internet IP address.

Chapter 1. Introduction

1.1. Introduction to IP Masquerading or IP MASQ

This document describes how to enable the Linux IP Masquerade feature on a
given Linux host. IP Masquerade, called "IPMASQ" or "MASQ" for short, is a
form of Network Address Translation (NAT) which allows internally connected
computers that do not have one or more registered Internet IP addresses to
communicate to the Internet via the Linux server's Internet IP address. Since
IPMASQ is a generic technology, you can connect the Linux server's internal
and external to other computers through LAN technologies like Ethernet,
TokenRing, and FDDI, as well as dialup connections line PPP or SLIP links.
This document primarily uses Ethernet and PPP connections in examples because
it is most commonly used with DSL / Cablemodems and dialup connections.

"This document is intended for systems running stable Linux kernels like
2.4.x, 2.2.x, and 2.0.x preferably on an IBM-compatible PC. IP Masquerade
does work on other Linux-supported platforms like Sparc, Alpha, PowerPC, etc.
but this HOWTO doesn't cover them in as much detail. Beta kernels such as
2.5.x, 2.3.x, 2.1.x, and ANY kernels less than 2.0.x are NOT covered in this
document. The primary reason for this is because many of the older kernels
are considered broken. If you are using an older kernel version, it is highly
advisable to upgrade to one of the stable Linux kernels before using IP
Masquerading. "
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2. Foreword, Feedback & Credits

From the original IPMASQ HOWTO author:

"As a new user, I found it very confusing to setup IP masquerade on the Linux
kernel, (back then, its was a 1.2.x kernel). Although there was a FAQ and a
mailing list, there was no documentation dedicated to this. There was also
some requests on the mailing list for a HOWTO manual. So, I decided to write
this HOWTO as a starting point for new users and possibly create a building
block for other knowledgeable users. If you, the reader, have any additional
ideas, corrections, or questions about this document, please feel free to
contact us. "

This document was originally written by [mailto:ambrose@writeme.com] Ambrose
Au back in August, 1996, based on the 1.x kernel IPMASQ FAQ written by Ken
Eves and numerous helpful messages from the original IP Masquerade mailing
list. In particular, a mailing list message from Matthew Driver inspired
Ambrose to set up IP Masquerade and eventually write version 0.80 of this
HOWTO. In April 1997, Ambrose created the Linux IP Masquerade Resource Web
site at [http://ipmasq.webhop.net] http://ipmasq.webhop.net which has
provided up-to-date information on Linux IP Masquerading ever since. In
February 1999, [dranch@trinnet.net] David Ranch took over maintenance of the
HOWTO. David then re-wrote the HOWTO and added a substantial number of
sections to the document. Today, the HOWTO is still maintained by David where
he constantly updates it and fixes any reported bugs, etc.

Please feel free to send any feedback or comments regarding this HOWTO to
[mailto:dranch@trinnet.net] dranch@trinnet.net if you have any corrections or
if any information/URLs/etc. is missing. Your invaluable feedback will
certainly influence the future of this HOWTO!

This HOWTO is meant to be a fairly comprehensive guide to getting your Linux
IP Masquerading system working in the shortest time possible. David only
plays a technical writer on T.V. so you might find the information in this
document not as general and/or objective as it could be. If you think a
section could be clearer, etc.. please let David know. The latest version of
the MASQ HOWTO can be found at [http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/LINUX/
index-linux.html#ipmasq] Dranch's Linux Page. Additional news, mirrors of the
HOWTO, and information regarding IPMASQ can be found at the [http://
ipmasq.webhop.net/] IP Masquerade Resource web page. If you have any
technical questions on IP Masquerade, please join the [http://
home.indyramp.net/mailman/listinfo/masq] IP Masquerade Mailing List instead
of sending email to David or Ambrose. Most MASQ problems are -common- for ALL
MASQ users and can be easily solved by users on the list. In addition to
this, the response time of the IP MASQ email list will be much faster than a
reply from either David or Ambrose.

Chapter 2. Background Knowledge

2.1. What is IP Masquerade?

IP Masquerade is a networking function in Linux similar to the one-to-many
(1:Many) NAT (Network Address Translation) servers found in many commercial
firewalls and network routers. For example, if a Linux host is connected to
the Internet via PPP, Ethernet, etc., the IP Masquerade feature allows other
"internal" computers connected to this Linux box (via PPP, Ethernet, etc.) to
also reach the Internet as well. Linux IP Masquerading allows for this
functionality even though these internal machines don't have an officially
assigned IP address.

MASQ allows a set of machines to invisibly access the Internet via the MASQ
gateway. To other machines on the Internet, the outgoing traffic will appear
to be from the IP MASQ Linux server itself. In addition to the added
functionality, IP Masquerade provides the foundation to create a HEAVILY
secured networking environment. With a well built firewall, breaking the
security of a well configured masquerading system and internal LAN should be
considerably difficult to accomplish.

If you would like to know more on how MASQ (1:Many) differs from 1:1 (true)
NAT and Proxy solutions, please see the Section 7.6 FAQ entry.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2. Current Status

IP Masquerade has been in the Linux kernels for several years now and is
quite mature as the kernel enters the 2.4.x stage. Kernels since Linux 1.3.x
have had MASQ support built-in. Today, many individuals and commercial
businesses are using it with excellent results.

2.4.x kernel users:

  * The 2.4.x kernel hosts an entirely re-written set of NAT code which is
    both far superior, faster, and more secure than any previous versions
    written for Linux. Unfortunately, several kernel modules that were
    written for the 2.2.x kernel to support things like UDP-based RealAudio,
    etc. have not been ported to 2.4.x yet. Because of this, some people
    should consider NOT upgrading if these network applications are critical
    to them. But, at the same time, some of these programs have been updated
    and now use different, NAT-friendly protocols. Thus special NAT treatment
    is no longer required. As always, please see the http://ipmasq.webhop.net
    /: The IP Masquerade Resources site for updated news, etc.
   

Common network functionalities like Web browsing, telnet, ssh, ping,
traceroute, etc. work well over stock IP Masquerade setups. Other network
applications such as ftp, irc, and Real Audio work well with the appropriate
additional IP MASQ modules loaded into the kernel as modules. Other
network-specific programs like streaming audio (MP3s, True Speech, etc)
should work too without any special module. Some users on the mailing list
also had good results with video conferencing software.

It should be noted that running IP Masquerade with only ONE network card
(NIC) to MASQ between internal and external Ethernet networks is NOT
recommended. For more details, please see Section 7.28 FAQ section.

Anyways, please refer to Section 6.3 for a more complete listing of software
supported by IP Maquerade all kernel versions.

IP Masquerade works well as a server to other 'client machines' running
various operating systems and hardware platforms. Here is a sampling of
successful reports with internal MASQed systems running :

 

  * UNIX: Sun Solaris, [Net,Free,Open,*i]-BSD, Hp-UX, Linux, IBM AIX, Digital
    UNIX, Ultrix, etc.
   
  * Microsoft Windows 2000, NT (3.x and 4.x), 95/98/ME, Windows for
    Workgroups (with the TCP/IP package)
   
  * IBM OS/2
   
  * Apple Macintosh MacOS machines running either MacTCP or Open Transport
   
  * DOS-based systems with packet drivers and the NCSA Telnet package
   
  * VAXen
   
  * Compaq/Digital Alpha running Linux and NT
   
  * Amiga computers with AmiTCP or AS225-stack.
   

 

The list goes on and on but the point is, if your OS platform talks TCP/IP,
it should work with Linux's IP Masquerade!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3. Who Can Benefit From IP Masquerade?

 

  * If you have a Linux host connected to the Internet and..
   
  * if you have internal computers running TCP/IP connected that are
    connected to this Linux box via on a network, and/or
   
  * if your Linux host has more than one modem and acts as a PPP or SLIP
    server connected to other computers, and these machines do not have
    official or public assigned IP addresses (i.e. addressed with private TCP
    /IP numbers).
   
  * If you want those OTHER machines to communicate to the Internet without
    spending extra money to acquire additional Public / Official TCP/IP
    addresses from your ISP, then you should either configure Linux to be a
    router or purchase an external router.
   

 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.4. Who Doesn't Need IP Masquerade?

 

  * If your machine is a stand-alone Linux host connected to the Internet
    (setting up a firewall is a good idea though), or
   
  * if you already have multiple assigned public addresses for your OTHER
    machines, and
   
  * if you don't like the idea of a 'free ride' using Linux and feel more
    comfortable using expensive commercial tools to perform the exact same
    functionalities.
   

 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.5. How does IP Masquerade Work?

Based from the original IP Masquerade FAQ by Ken Eves: Here is a drawing of
the most simplistic setup:
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|PPP/ETH/etc.        +------------+                         +-------------+ |
|to ISP provider     |  Linux #1  |       PPP/ETH/etc.      | Anybox      | |
|                    |            |                         |             | |
|  <---------- modem1|            |modem2 ----------- modem3|             | |
|                    |            |                         |             | |
|    111.222.121.212 |            |           192.168.0.100 |             | |
|                    +------------+                         +-------------+ |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In the above drawing, a Linux box with IP_MASQUERADING is installed as Linux
#1 and is connected to the Internet via PPP, Ethernet, etc. It has an
assigned public IP address of 111.222.121.212. It also has another network
interface (e.g. modem2) connected to allow incoming network traffic be it
from a PPP connection, Ethernet connection, etc.

The second system (which does not need to be Linux) connects into the Linux #
1 box and starts its network traffic to the Internet. This second machine
does NOT have a publicly assigned IP address from the Internet, so it uses an
[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt?number=1918] RFC1918 private address,
say 192.168.0.100. (see below for more info)

With IP Masquerade and the routing configured properly, this second machine
"Anybox" can interact with the Internet as if it was directly connected to
the Internet with a few small exceptions [noted later].

Quoting Pauline Middelink (the founder of Linux's IPMASQ):

"Do not forget to mention that the "ANYBOX" machine should have the Linux #1
box configured as its default gateway (whether it be the default route or
just a subnet is no matter). If the "ANYBOX" machine is connected via a PPP
or SLIP connection, the Linux #1 machine should be configured to support
proxy arp for all routed addresses. But, the setup and configuration of proxy
arp is beyond the scope of this document. Please see the [http://www.tldp.org
/HOWTO/PPP-HOWTO/index.html] PPP-HOWTO for more details."

The following is an excerpt on how IPMASQ briefly works though this will be
explained in more detail later. This short text is based from a previous post
on comp.os.linux.networking which has been edited to match the names used in
the above example:
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   o I tell machine ANYBOX that my PPP or Ethernet connected Linux box is its  |
|     gateway.                                                                  |
|                                                                               |
|   o When a packet comes into the Linux box from ANYBOX, it will assign the    |
|     packet to a new TCP/IP source port number and insert its own IP address   |
|     inside the packet header, saving the originals.  The MASQ server will     |
|     then send the modified packet over the PPP/ETH interface onto the         |
|     Internet.                                                                 |
|                                                                               |
|   o When a packet returns from the Internet into the Linux box, Linux         |
|     examines if the port number is one of those ports that was assigned       |
|     above.  If so, the MASQ server will then take the original port and       |
|     IP address, put them back in the returned packet header, and send         |
|     the packet to ANYBOX.                                                     |
|                                                                               |
|   o The host that sent the packet will never know the difference.             |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In this example, there are (4) computer systems that we are concerned about.
There is also presumably something on the far right that your PPP/ETH
connection to the Internet comes through (modem server, DSL DSLAM, Cablemodem
router, etc.). Out on the Internet, there exists some remote host (very far
off to the right of the page) that you are interested in communicating with).
The Linux system named Masq-Gate is the IP Masquerading gateway for ALL
internal networked machines. In this example, the machines A-box, B-box, and 
C-box would have to go through the Masq-Gate to reach the Internet. The
internal network uses one of several [http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/
rfc/rfc1918.html] RFC-1918 assigned private network addresses, where in this
case, would be the Class-C network 192.168.0.0. If you aren't familiar with
RFC1918, it is encouraged to read the first few chapters of the RFC but the
jist of it is that the TCP/IP addresses 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16-31.0.0/12, and
192.168.0.0/16 are reserved. When we say "reserved", we mean that anyone can
use these addresses as long as they aren't routed over the Internet. ISPs are
even allowed to use this private addressing space as long as they keep these
addresses within their own networks and NOT advertise them to other ISPs.
Unfortunately, this isn't always the case but thats beyond the scope of this
HOWTO.

Anyway, the Linux box in the diagram above has the TCP/IP address 192.168.0.1
while the other systems has the addresses:

 

  * A-Box: 192.168.0.2
   
  * B-Box: 192.168.0.3
   
  * C-Box: 192.168.0.4
   

 

The three machines, A-box, B-box and C-box, can have any one of several
operating systems, just as long as they can speak TCP/IP. Some such as 
Windows 95, Macintosh MacTCP or OpenTransport , or even another Linux box
have the ability to connect to other machines on the Internet. When running
the IP Masquerade, the masquerading system or MASQ-gate converts all of these
internal connections so that they appear to originate from the masq-gate
itself. MASQ then arranges so that the data coming back to a masqueraded
connection is relayed to the proper originating system. Therefore, the
systems on the internal network are only able to see a direct route to the
internet and are unaware that their data is being masqueraded. This is called
a "Transparent" connection.

NOTE: Please see Chapter 7 for more details on topics such as:

 

  * The differences between NAT, MASQ, and Proxy servers.
   
  * How packet firewalls work
   

 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.6. Requirements for IP Masquerade on Linux 2.4.x

" ** Please refer to IP Masquerade Resource for the latest information. ** "

  * The newest 2.4.x kernels are now using both a completely new TCP/IP
    network stack as well as a new NAT sub-system called NetFilter. Within
    this NetFilter suite of tools, we now have a tool called IPTABLES for the
    2.4.x kernels much like there was IPCHAINS for the 2.2.x kernels and
    IPFWADM for the 2.0.x kernels. The new IPTABLES system is far more
    powerful (combines several functions into one place like true NAT
    functionality), offers better security (stateful inspection), and better
    performance with the new 2.4.x TCP/IP stack. But this new suite of tools
    can be a bit complicated in comparison to older generation kernels.
    Hopefully, if you follow along with this HOWTO carefully, setting up
    IPMASQ won't be too bad. If you find anything unclear, downright wrong,
    etc. please email David about it.
   
    Unlike the migration to IPCHAINS from IPFWADM, the new NetFilter tool has
    kernel modules that can actually support older IPCHAINS and IPFWADM
    rulesets with minimal changes. So re-writing your old MASQ or firewall
    ruleset scripts is not longer required. BUT.. with the 2.4.x kernels, you
    cannot use the old 2.2.x MASQ modules like ip_masq_ftp, ip_masq_irc, etc.
    AND IPCHAINS is incompatible with the new IPTABLES modules like
    ip_conntrack_ftp, etc. So, what does this mean? It basically means that
    if you want to use IPMASQ or PORTFW functionality under a 2.4.x kernel,
    you shouldn't use IPCHAINS rules but IPTABLES ones instead. Please also
    keep in mind that there might be several benefits in performing a full
    ruleset re-write to take advantage of the newer IPTABLES features like
    stateful tracking, etc. but that is dependant upon how much time you have
    to migrate your old rulesets. Please see Section 7.39 for additional
    details.
   

Some new 2.4.x functionalities include the following:

PROs:

  * Lots of new protocols modules like: amanda, eggdrop, ipsec, ipv6,
    portscan, pptp, quota, rsh, talk, and tftp
   
  * TRUE 1:1 NAT functionality for those who have TCP/IP addresses and
    subnets to use (no more iproute2 commands)
   
  * Stateful application level (FTP, IRC, etc.) and stateful protocol level
    (TCP/UDP/ICMP) network traffic inspection
   
  * Built-in PORT Forwarding (no more ipmasqadm or ipportfw commands)
   
  * The built-in PORTFW'ing support works for both external and internal
    traffic. This means that users that have PORTFW for external traffic and
    REDIR for internal port redirection do not need to use two tools any
    more!
   
  * PORT Forwarding of FTP traffic to internal hosts is now completely
    supported and is handled in the conn_trak_ftp module
   
  * Full Policy-Based routing features (source-based TCP/IP address routing)
   
  * Compatibility with Linux's FastRoute feature for significantly faster
    packet forwarding (a.k.a Linux network switching).
   
    Note that this feature is still not compatible with packet filtering for
    strong firewall rulesets.
   
  * Fully supports TCP/IP v4, v6, and even DECnet (ack!)
   
  * Supports wildcard interface names like "ppp*" for serial interfaces like
    ppp0, ppp1, etc
   
  * Supports filtering on both input and output INTERFACES (not just IP
    addresses)
   
  * Source Ethernet MAC filtering
   
  * Denial of Service (DoS) packet rate limiting
   
  * Packet REJECTs now have user-selectable return ICMP messages
   
  * Variable levels of logging (different packets can go to different SYSLOG
    levels)
   
  * Other features like traffic mirroring, securing traffic per login, etc.
   

 

 CONs:

  * Netfilter is an entirely new architechure thus most of the older 2.2.x
    MASQ kernel modules written to make non-NAT friendly network applications
    work through IPMASQ need to be re-written for the 2.4.x kernels. Because
    of this, if you specifically need functionality from some of these
    modules (see below), you should stay with a 2.2.x kernel until these
    modules have been either ported or the application has been updated to
    use NAT-friendly protocols. If you are curious on the porting status of a
    given module, please email the author of the module and NOT David or
    Ambrose. We don't code.. we just document. :-)
   
    Here is the status of the known IP Masq kernel modules or patches as
    found on the IPMASQ WWW site's Application Support Matrix. In addition,
    you should also setup out the [http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/
    pomlist/pom-summary.html] Netfilter Patch-o-Matic URL as well. If you
    have the time and knowledge to help in the porting of code, your efforts
    would be highly appreciated:

Linux 2.4.x IP Masquerade requirements include:

  * Any decent computer hardware. See Section 7.2 for more details.
   
  * The 2.4.x kernel source is available from [http://www.kernel.org/] http:/
    /www.kernel.org/.
   
    NOTE: Most modern Linux distributions, Section 7.1, that natively come
    with 2.4.x kernels are typically modular kernels and have all the IP
    Masquerade functionality already included. In such cases, there is no
    need to compile a new Linux kernel. If you are UPGRADING your kernel, you
    should be aware of other programs that might be required and/or need to
    be upgraded as well (mentioned later in this HOWTO).
   
  * The program "iptables" version 1.2.4 or newer ( 1.2.7a or newer is highly
    recommended ) archive available from [http://www.netfilter.org/] http://
    www.netfilter.org/
   
      + NOTE #1: All versions of IPTABLES less than 1.2.3 have a FTP module
        issue that can bypass any existing firewall rulesets. ALL IPTABLES
        users are highly recommended to upgrade to the newest version. The
        URL is above.
       
        NOTE #2: All versions of IPTABLES less than 1.2.2 have a FTP "port"
        security vulnerability in the ip_conntrack_ftp module. All IPTABLES
        users are highly recommended to upgrade to the newest version. The
        URL is above.
       
      + This tool, much like the older IPCHAINS and IPFWADM tools enables the
        various Masquerding code, more advanced forms of NAT, packet
        filtering, etc. It also makes use of additional MASQ modules like the
        FTP and IRC modules. Additional information on version requirements
        for the newest IPTABLES howto, etc. is located at the [http://
        www.netfilter.org/] Unreliable IPTABLES HOWTOs page.

      + NOTE #1: --- UPDATE YOUR KERNEL --- Linux 2.2.x kernels less than
        version 2.2.20 contain several different security vulnerabilities
        (some were MASQ specific). Kernels less than 2.2.20 have a few local
        vulnerabilities. Kernel versions less than 2.2.16 have a TCP root
        exploit vulnerability and versions less than 2.2.11 have a IPCHAINS
        fragmentation bug. Because of these issues, users running a firewall
        with strong IPCHAINS rulesets are open to possible instrusion. Please
        upgrade your kernel to a fixed version.
       
   
  * NOTE #2: Some newer Section 7.1 such as Redhat 5.2 might not be Linux
    2.2.x ready (upgradable). Tools like DHCP, NetUtils, etc. will need to be

Chapter 3. Setting Up IP Masquerade

3.1. Compiling a new kernel if needed

If your private network contains any vital information, think carefully in
terms of SECURITY before implementing IP Masquerade. By default, IP MASQ
becomes a GATEWAY for you to get onto the Internet, but it also can allow
someone from the Internet to possibly get into your internal network.

Once you have IP MASQ functioning, it is HIGHLY recommended for the user to
implement a STRONG IPFWADM/IPCHAINS firewall ruleset. Please see Section
6.4.1, Section 6.4.2 and Section 6.4.3 located below for more details.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2. Checking your existing kernel for MASQ functionality

Almost ALL modern Linux distributions come MASQ-Ready these days but its
always good to check your system before you try to set things up. Follow
these few steps for your kernel to see if your kernel is MASQ ready.

To see which kernel your system is running, run the following command:
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|uname -a                                                                   |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 

  * Just for clarity: 2.4.x kernels run IPTABLES :: 2.2.x kernels run
    IPCHAINS :: 2.0.x kernels run IPFWADM
   
  * In general, you must have kernel support for:
   
      + IP forwarding
       
      + IP masquerading
       
      + IP Firewalling
       
      + etc.
       
   

You will also need to have most MASQ-related modules compiled (most modular
kernels will already have all you need already done. Then you will NOT need
to re-compile the kernel. If you AREN'T SURE if your Linux distribution is
MASQ ready, do the following:

  * 2.4.x kernels (look for most of the following entries out of the much
    longer list):
   
      + Run the command "ls /proc/sys/net/ipv4" while logged into the Linux
        box. These items are required and should be present regardless if
        your kernel built IPMASQ as modules or statically.
       
          o ip_dynaddr
           
            ip_forward
           
       
      + To check if IPMASQ was compiled statically into the kernel, run the
        command "/sbin/lsmod" and see if and modules like the ones shown
        below for the MODULE section are loaded. No? Ok, now run the command
        "ls /proc/net/" and see if you see additional /proc files such as:
       
          o ip_masquerade
           
            ip_conntrack
           
            ip_tables_names
           
        If you see these /proc entries and there WEREN'T any kernel modules
        loaded (shown via the "lsmod" command mentioned above), then your
        kernel has the IPTABLES subsystem statically compiled into it and is
        ready to go to use IPMASQ on this system.
      + If your kernel uses IPTABLES via modules, most of the stuff listed
        above should have been missing (because the modules probably aren't
        loaded). Run the command "ls /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/net/ipv4/
        netfilter/" where you should see files like:
       
          o ip_conntrack.o, ip_conntrack_ftp.o, ip_conntrack_irc.o,
            ip_nat_ftp.o, ip_nat_irc.o
           
            ip_tables.o, ipt_MASQUERADE.o, iptable_nat.o, iptable_mangle.o,
            iptable_filter.o
           
            And some optional ones like: ipchains.o, ipt_REJECT.o, and
            ipt_tcpmss.o
           
        If you see those kernel files, IPTABLES was compiled using modules
        and things look ready to go to use IPMASQ on this system.
   
  * 2.2.x kernels (look for most of the following entries out of the much
    longer list): list):
   
      + Run the command "ls /proc/sys/net/ipv4" while logged into the Linux
        box. These items are required and should be present regardless if
        your kernel built IPMASQ as modules or statically.
       
          o ip_always_defrag
           
            ip_dynaddr
           
            ip_forward
           
            ip_masq_debug
           
            ip_masq_udp_dloose (some distros don't support this -- ignore it
            for now
           
              Other 2.2.x options can be checked by running "ls /proc/net/"
           
              # ip_fwchains
               
                ip_fwnames
               
                ip_masquerade
               
           
            Even more 2.2.x options can be checked by running "ls /proc/net/"
           
              # app
               
                icmp
               
                icq
               
                mfw
               
                portfw
               
                tcp
               
                udp/
               
           
       
   
  * 2.0.x kernels (look for most of the following entries out of the much
    longer list):
   
      + Run the command "ls /proc/sys/net/ipv4" while logged into the Linux
        box. These items are required and should be present regardless if
        your kernel built IPMASQ as modules or statically.

            ip_forward
           
            running "ls /proc/net"

                ip_masq_app
               
                ip_masquerade
               
                ip_portfw
               
           
       
   

Ultimately, it comes down to the fact if you see /proc files such as
"iip_forward", "ip_masq_debug", "ip_masq_udp_dloose"(optional), and
"ip_always_defrag" (optional) exist.

So. Do most of the above /proc entries or kernel modules show up for your
respective kernel? If so, thats good! If you cannot find any of the above
entries or if you aren't sure if your distribution supports IP Masquerading
by default, ASSUME IT DOESN'T SUPPORT MASQ. You can do one last check by
looking at the Section 7.1 section and see if your Linux Distribution is
listed. Still not there? Sounds like you'll need to compile a kernel but
don't worry.. it isn't hard.

Regardless if your current kernel has MASQ support or not, reading the
remainder of this section is still highly recommended as it contains other
useful information.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.1. Compiling Linux 2.4.x Kernels

  * First, you'll need to get some 2.4.x kernel sources (preferably the
    latest kernel version - NEWER *IS* BETTER IN LINUX LAND)
   
      + NOTE #1: As both the 2.4.x kernel train and the iptables program
        development progresses, the compile configurion options will change
        over time. As of this version of the IPMASQ howto, this section
        reflects the settings for IPTABLES 1.2.7a and the 2.4.20 kernel. If
        you are compiling against a newer or previous kernel or IPTABLES
        version, the dialogs and even commands might look different. It is
        recommended that you update to the newest versions of both the kernel
        and IPTABLES for added capability, performance, and stability of the
        kernel.
       
   
  * Next, depending on the version of the Linux kernel and IPTABLES archive
    you downloaded, you might want to apply some IPTABLES "patch-o-matic"
    patches against the kernel. These OPTIONAL patches might fix some known
    problems, add additional functionality you might need (H.323 protocol,
    specific issues with network games), etc. It should be noted that the
    Patch-O-Matic patches used to come with the IPTABLES archive. This is no
    longer the case and you have to download them (if any) seperately. You
    can find the the various URLs for downloading IPTABLES, the Patch-o-matic
    system, etc. Section 2.6.
   
  * If this is your first time compiling the kernel, don't be scared. In
    fact, it's rather easy and it's covered in several URLs found in Section
    2.6. Please note that the instructions included here is just one way to
    do build a kernel. Please see the Kernel HOWTO for full details.
   
    NOTE: Please notice that it IS NOT recommended to put the new kernel
    sources into the /usr/src/linux directory. You should leave the original
    kernel sources that came with your Linux distribution in /usr/src/linux.
    For more details on this topic, please read the "README" file in the top
    level directory of the kernel sources.
   
  * For this HOWTO example, create a directory called /usr/src/kernel. Next,
    "cd" into this directory and download the newest 2.4.x kernel sources
    into it. Once downloaded, issue the following command (if the file ends
    in a .tar.gz): tar xvzf linux-2.4.x.tar.gz or (if the file ends in a
    .tar.bzip2): tar xyvf linux-2.4.x.tar.bz2. Please substitute the "x" in
    the 2.4.x filename with the Linux 2.4 kernel version you downloaded.
   
    BZ2 Note: Some Linux distributions use the "I" option instead of the "y"
    option to decompress bzip2 archives.
   
    Once uncompressed, I recommend that you rename the directory from the
    stock "linux" name to "linux-2.4.x" (replace the "x" with the specific
    version of your newly installed kernel) for clarity. To do this, run the
    command "mv linux linux-2.4.x". Next, make sure there is a directory or
    symbolic link pointing to "/usr/src/kernel/linux" ie. run the command:
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |ln -s /usr/src/kernel/linux-2.4.x /usr/src/kernel/linux        |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    again subsituting the "x" for your proper kernel version.
   
  * As mentioned above, you might consider applying any appropriate or
    optional patches to the kernel's MASQ code BEFORE you compile the final
    kernel. The IP MASQ code found in the stock kernels is already very
    useful and does not require any specific patching in order for the system
    to work for NAT-friendly network applications. Many of these patches are
    only to fix possible known bugs, add new features (some are /very/ cool),
    etc. Please refer to Section 2.6 for URLs and the [http://
    ipmasq.webhop.net/] IP Masquerade Resources for up-to-date information
    and patch URLs.
   
  * Applying IPTABLES and Patch-o-Matic kernel patches
   
    Download the iptables package and optional Patch-O-matics from the 
    Section 2.6 and put it into a directory, say "/usr/src/archive/
    netfilter". Next, go into this new netfilter directory and uncompress the
    iptables archive with the command:
   
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |tar xyvf iptables-x.y.z.tar.bz2                                |
    |tar xyvf patch-o-matic-x.tar.bz2                               |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   
    Now, go into the new iptables-x.y.x directory (/usr/src/archive/netfilter
    /iptables-x.y.z) and run the command
   
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    | #For iptables v1.2.7a:                                        |
    | make KERNEL_DIR=/usr/src/kernel/linux                         |
    |                                                               |
    | #For iptables v1.2.4 (when Patch-o-matic was built-in):       |
    | make pending-patches KERNEL_DIR=/usr/src/kernel/linux         |
    |                                                               |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   
    NOTE: this assumes that your 2.4.x kernel sources are in the /usr/src/
    kernel/linux directory.
   
    NOTE #2: If you append a "/" to the end of the above command line, you
    will get an error stating:
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
    |"make: *** [/usr/src/kernel/linux/include/asm/socket.h] Error 1".|
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
    Remove the trailing "/" and try again.
   
    Here is an example of compiling IPTABLES v1.2.7a. Your output might look
    different depending on what version you are trying to use.

Next, if you are interested in applying a Patch-O-Matic patch set, go into
the patch-o-matic-X directory (/usr/src/archive/netfilter/patch-o-matic-X)
and run the command

  * +----------------------------------------------------------------+
    | #For Patch-O-Matic later than the release of iptables v1.2.7a: |
    | KERNEL_DIR=/usr/src/kernel/linux                               |
    | ./runme pending                                                |
    |                                                                |
    +----------------------------------------------------------------+
   
    NOTE #1: The use of the "pending" batch is the most common for IPMASQ
    functionality but there are several others. See below.
   
    NOTE #2: this assumes that your 2.4.x kernel sources are in the /usr/src/
    kernel/linux directory.
   
    NOTE #3: If you append a "/" to the end of the command line, you will get
    an error stating:
    +------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |"make: *** [/usr/src/kernel/linux/include/asm/socket.h] Error 1". |
    |Remove the trailing "/" and try again.                            |
    +------------------------------------------------------------------+
   
    Here is an example of the Patch-O-Matic prompts you might receive for a
    2.4.20 kernel with the "20030107" Patch-O-Matic set. You can also run the
    "runme" program in a batch mode to speed things up, add experimental
    patches, etc. if you'd like. To better understand your options, simply
    run the "./runme" command by itself. Please note that these prompts WILL
    CHANGE over time.

    kernel.
   
  * Ok, now the new kernel is ready to be compiled but you should make sure
    that you also have the proper matching iptables program on your machine
    too (just to make sure). Run the command:
   
      + +------------------------------------------------------------+
        |whereis iptables                                            |
        +------------------------------------------------------------+
       
    and make sure its installed on the machine (the default place is in /usr/
    local/sbin/iptables. If you cannot find it or patched up your kernel
    sources as shown above, I recommend you just re-compile it up as shown
    above.

Now that the kernel sources are patched up, you need to configure it to know
what kinds of features you need (HD support, Networking support, MASQ
support, etc.). Here are the MINIMUM kernel configuration options required to
enable IP Masquerade functionality. Please understand that this HOWTO
illustrates just ONE way to configure and compile a kernel (modules vs
static). The main difference from this example vs. an example given by a
different MASQ guide is that some people might wish to compile kernel
components either as modules OR monolithically into the kernel. Basically,
compiling things as modules gives you added flexibility to what is or isn't
installed into the kernel (reduces unneeded memory use for things you aren't
/ won't use and modules also allow for drop-in software upgrades [usually no
need to reboot the machine]). On the flip side, kernel modules add more
complexity to your configuration and sometimes the kernel auto-loader might
make mistakes (not that I've ever seen this happen). Compiling things
directly into the kernel makes things simpler BUT you loose a huge level of
flexibility. The following kernel configuration example is a mixture of both
a selection of kernel modules and building them in monolithically (you
probably will ALWAYS need MASQ functionality ready to go).

  * Side Note: It is assumed that you will also configure the kernel to use
    your other installed hardware such as USB printers, Ethernet network
    interfaces, SCSI and IDE HD controllers, etc. as well. Please refer to
    the [http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO/index.html] Linux Kernel
    HOWTO and the kernel source's "README" file and "Documentation/"
    directory for detailed help on compiling a kernel.
   

You will need to answer either YES, NO, or MODULE to the following program.
Not all options will be available without the proper kernel patches described
later in this HOWTO. This shouldn't be an issue as most 3rd party patches are
only needed for a very select group of users.

Run the following commands to configure your kernel:

 

  * cd /usr/src/kernel/linux
   
  * make menuconfig
   

Please note the following kernel prompts reflect a 2.4.14 kernel (with some
of the optional Patch-O-Matic additions. Please read the following carefully

So go ahead and select "exit" and you should be prompted to save your config.

NOTE: These are just the kernel components you need for IP Masquerade
networking support. You will need to select whatever other options needed for
your specific setup. If you want more information on what each one of these
kernel modules does, please see the FAQ section of this HOWTO for details.  

  * Now compile the kernel (make dep; make clean; make bzImage; make modules;
    make modules_install) , etc. Again, it is beyond the scope of this HOWTO
    if you have problems compiling your kernel. Please see Section 2.6 for
    URLs to the KERNEL howto, etc.
   
  * You will then have move over the kernel binary, update your bootloader
    (LILO, Grub, etc.), and reboot. If you have questions about kernel
    compiling, I highly recommend to consult some of the URLs mentioned above
    in this section.

3.2.2. Compiling Linux 2.2.x Kernels

Please see Section 2.7 for any required software, patches, etc.

  * First of all, you need the kernel source for 2.2.x (preferably the latest
    kernel version)
   
      + NOTE #1: --- UPDATE YOUR KERNEL --- Linux 2.2.x kernels less than
        version 2.2.20 contain several different security vulnerabilities
        (some were MASQ specific). Kernels less than 2.2.20 have a few local
        vulnerabilities. Kernel versions less than 2.2.16 have a TCP root
        exploit vulnerability and versions less than 2.2.11 have a IPCHAINS
        fragmentation bug. Because of these issues, users running a firewall
        with strong IPCHAINS rulesets are open to possible instrusion. Please
        upgrade your kernel to a fixed version.
       
      + NOTE #2: As the 2.2.x train progressed, the compile-time options keep
        on changing. As of this version, this section reflects the settings
        for a 2.2.20 kernel.
       
        If you are running either a newer or older kernel version, the
        dialogs will look different. It is recommended that you update to the
        newest kernel for added capability and stability of the system.
       
   
  * If this is your first time compiling the kernel, don't be scared. In
    fact, it's rather easy and it's covered in several URLs found in Section
    2.7. Please note that the instructions included here is just one way to
    do build a kernel. Please see the Kernel HOWTO for full details.
   
    NOTE: Please notice that it isn't recommended to put the new kernel
    sources into /usr/src/linux. You should leave the original kernel sources
    that came with your Linux distribution in /usr/src/linux. For more
    details on this topic, please read the "README" file in the top level
    directory of your kernel sources.
   
  * For this HOWTO example, create a directory called /usr/src/kernel. Next,
    "cd" into this directory and download the newest 2.2.x kernel sources
    into it. Once downloaded, issue the following command (if the file ends
    in a .tar.gz): tar xvzf linux-2.2.x.tar.gz or (if the file ends in a
    .tar.bzip2): tar xyvf linux-2.2.x.tar.bz2. Please substitute the "x" in
    the 2.2.x filename with the Linux 2.2 kernel version you downloaded.
   
    NOTE: Some Linux distributions use the "I" option instead of the "y"
    option to decompress bzip2 archives.
   
    Once uncompressed, I recommend that you rename the directory from "linux"
    to "linux-2.2.x" for clarity. To do this, run the command mv linux
    linux-2.2.x. Next, make sure there is a directory or symbolic link
    pointing to /usr/src/kernel/linux ie. run the command: ln -s /usr/src/
    kernel/linux-2.2.x /usr/src/kernel/linuxo again subsituting the "x" for
    your proper kernel version.
   
  * Apply any appropriate or optional patches to the kernel source code. By
    default, stock Linux kernels do not require any specific patching in
    order for the system to work. Features like PPTP/IPSEC masqurading are
    already built-in in the newest kernels but other tools like Xwindows
    forwarders are optional. Please refer to Section 2.7 for URLs and the
    [http://ipmasq.webhop.net/] IP Masquerade Resources for up-to-date
    information and patch URLs.
   
  * Now that the kernel is patched up (if required), here are the MINIMUM
    kernel configuration options required to enable IP Masquerade
    functionality. Please understand that this HOWTO illustrates just ONE way
    to compile a kernel. The main difference from this method vs. a different
    one is some people wish to compile things either as modules OR
    monolithically right into the kernel. Basically, compiling things as
    modules gives you added flexibility to what is or isn't installed into
    the kernel (reduces unneeded memory use and allow for drop-in upgrades
    [no need to reboot]) BUT they add more complexity to your configuration.
    On the flip side, compiling things directly into the kernel makes things
    simpler BUT you loose a level of flexibility. The following example is a
    mixture of both built-in AND modules.
   
    Side Note: It is assumed that you will also configure the kernel to use
    your other installed hardware such as network interfaces, optional SCSI
    controllers, etc. as well. Please refer to the Linux Kernel HOWTO and the
    kernel source's README file and Documentation/ directory for detailed
    help on compiling a kernel.
   

Please note the YES or NO ANSWERS to the following. Not all options will be
available without the proper kernel patches described later in this HOWTO.

Run the following commands to configure your kernel:

  * cd /usr/src/kernel/linux
   
  * make menuconfig
   

 

The following kernel prompts reflect a 2.2.20 kernel:

|    - OPTIONAL:  Not needed for normal MASQ functionality though people who                     |
|           want to do transparent proxy via Squid will want this.  Please note                  |

|           modules like the PORTFW to give external computers a directly                        |
|           connection to specified internal MASQed machines.                                    |
|                                                                                                |
|  * IP: ipautofw masq support (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_IPAUTOFW) [N/y/m/?] n        |
|    - NO:  NOT recommended : IPautofw is a legacy method of port forwarding.  It                |
|           is mainly old code and has been found to have some issues.                           |
|                                                                                                |
|  * IP: ipportfw masq support (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_IPPORTFW) [Y/m/n/?] y        |
|    - OPTIONAL: Recommended : This enables PORTFW which allows external computers               |
|           on the Internet to directly communicate to specified internal MASQed                 |
|           machines.  This feature is typically used to allow access to internal                |
|           SMTP, TELNET, and WWW servers.  Please note that FTP port forwarding                 |
|           needs an additional patch, as described in the FAQ section of the MASQ               |
|           HOWTO.  Please see the this FAQ section in the HOWTO for additional                  |
|           information.                                                                         |

|  * IP: ip fwmark masq-forwarding support (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_MFW) [Y/m/n/?] y |
|    - OPTIONAL:  This is a NEW method of performing PORTFW-like functionality which is          |
|           similar to how the new 2.4.x kernels do things.  With this option, IPCHAINS          |
|           can mark packets that should have additional work done upon it.  Using a             |
|           UserSpace tool, much like IPMASQADM or IPPORFW, IPCHAINS would then                  |
|           do things like re-address the packets, change their TOS value, etc.                  |
|           Currently, this code is less tested than PORTFW but it looks promising.              |
|           For now, this HOWTO recommends to use IPMASQADM and IPPORTFW.  If you                |
|           have specific thoughts or comments on MFW, please email dranch.                      |

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
So go ahead and "exit" and you should be prompted to save your config. 

NOTE: These are just the components you need for IP Masquerade. You will need
to select whatever other options needed for your specific setup.

  * Now compile the kernel (make dep; make clean; make bzImage; make modules;
    make modules_install) , etc. Again, it is beyond the scope of this HOWTO
    if you have problems compiling your kernel. Please see Section 2.7 for
    URLs to the KERNEL howto, etc.
   
  * You will then have move over the kernel binary, update your bootloader
    (LILO, Grub, etc.), and reboot. If you have questions about kernel
    compiling, I highly recommend to consult some of the URLs above in this
    section.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2.3. Compiling Linux 2.0.x Kernels

Please see Section 2.8 for any required software, patches, etc.

  * First of all, you need the kernel source for 2.0.x (preferably the latest
    kernel version)
   
      + As the 2.0.x train progress, the compile-time options keep on
        changing. As of this version, this section reflects the settings for
        a 2.0.39 kernel.
       
   
  * If this is your first time compiling the kernel, don't be scared. In
    fact, it's rather easy and it's covered in several URLs found in Section
    2.8. Please note that the instructions included here is just one way to
    do build a kernel. Please see the Kernel HOWTO for full details.
   
    NOTE: Please notice that it isn't recommended to put the new kernel
    sources into /usr/src/linux. You should leave the original kernel sources
    that came with your Linux distribution in /usr/src/linux. For more
    details on this topic, please read the "README" file in the top level
    directory of your kernel sources.
   
  * For this HOWTO example, create a directory called /usr/src/kernel. Next,
    "cd" into this directory and download the newest 2.0.x kernel sources
    into it. Once downloaded, issue the following command: tar xvzf
    linux-2.0.x.tar.gz . Please substitute the "x" in the 2.0.x filename with
    the Linux 2.0 kernel version you downloaded.
   
    Once uncompressed, I recommend that you rename the directory from "linux"
    to "linux-2.0.x" for clarity. To do this, run the command mv linux
    linux-2.0.x. Next, make sure there is a directory or symbolic link
    pointing to /usr/src/kernel/linux ie. run the command: ln -s /usr/src/
    kernel/linux-2.0.x /usr/src/kernel/linuxo again subsituting the "x" for
    your proper kernel version.
   
  * Apply any appropriate or optional patches to the kernel source code. By
    default, stock Linux kernels do not require any specific patching in
    order for the system to work. Features like IPPORTFW, PPTP, and Xwindows
    forwarders are optional but very useful. Please refer to Section 2.8 for
    URLs and the [http://ipmasq.webhop.net/] IP Masquerade Resources for
    up-to-date information and patch URLs.
   
  * Now that the kernel is patched up (if required), here are the MINIMUM
    kernel configuration options required to enable IP Masquerade
    functionality. Please understand that this HOWTO illustrates just ONE way
    to compile a kernel. The main difference from this method vs. a different
    one is some people wish to compile things either as modules OR
    monolithically right into the kernel. Basically, compiling things as
    modules gives you added flexibility to what is or isn't installed into
    the kernel (reduces unneeded memory use and allow for drop-in upgrades
    [no need to reboot]) BUT they add more complexity to your configuration.
    On the flip side, compiling things directly into the kernel makes things
    simpler BUT you loose a level of flexibility. The following example is a
    mixture of both built-in AND modules.
   
    Side Note: It is assumed that you will also configure the kernel to use
    your other installed hardware such as network interfaces, optional SCSI
    controllers, etc. as well. Please refer to the Linux Kernel HOWTO and the
    kernel source's "README" file and "Documentation/" directory for detailed
    help on compiling a kernel.
   

Please note the YES or NO ANSWERS to the following options. Not all options
will be available without the proper kernel patches described later in this
HOWTO:

Run the following commands to configure your kernel:

  * cd /usr/src/kernel/linux
   
  * make menuconfig
   

The following kernel prompts reflect a 2.0.39 kernel:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

So go ahead and "exit" and you should be prompted to save your config.

NOTE: These are only components for IP Masquerade functionality. You may need
to also select additional options to match your specific network and hardware
setup.

  * Now compile the kernel (make dep; make clean; make bzImage; make modules;
    make modules_install) , etc. Again, it is beyond the scope of this HOWTO
    if you have problems compiling your kernel. Please see Section 2.8 for
    URLs to the KERNEL howto, etc.
   
  * You will then have move over the kernel binary, update your bootloader
    (LILO, Grub, etc.), and reboot. If you have questions about kernel
    compiling, I highly recommend to consult some of the URLs above in this
    section.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3. Assigning Private Network IP Addresses to the Internal LAN

Since all INTERNAL MASQed machines should NOT have official Internet assigned
addressees, there must be a specific and accepted way to allocate addresses
to those machines without conflicting with anyone else's Internet address.

From the original IP Masquerade FAQ:

RFC 1918 is the official document on which IP addresses are to be used in a
non-connected or "private" network. There are 3 blocks of numbers set aside
specifically for this purpose.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Section 3: Private Address Space                                               |
|                                                                               |
|The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved the                |
|following three blocks of the IP address space for private networks:           |
|                                                                               |
|              10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255                               |
|              172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255                               |
|              192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255                              |
|                                                                               |
|We will refer to the first block as "24-bit block", the second as "20-bit      |
|block", and the third as "16-bit" block".  Note that the first block is        |
|nothing but a single class A network number, while the second block is a set   |
|of 16 continuous class B network numbers, and the third block is a set of 255  |
|continuous class C network numbers.                                            |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

For the record, my preference is to use the 192.168.0.0 network with a
255.255.255.0 Class-C subnet mask and thus this HOWTO reflects this. Any of
the above private networks are valid, but just be SURE to use the correct
subnet-mask.

So, if you're using a Class-C network, you should number your TCP/IP enabled
machines as 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.2, 192.168.0.3, .., 192.168.0.x

192.168.0.1 is usually set as the internal gateway or Linux MASQ machine
which reaches the external network. Please note that 192.168.0.0 and
192.168.0.255 are the Network and Broadcast address respectively (these
addresses are RESERVED). Avoid using these addresses on your machines or your
network will not function properly.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.4. Configuring IP Forwarding Policies

At this point, you should have your kernel and other required packages
installed. All network IP addresses, gateway, and DNS addresses should be
configured on your Linux MASQ server. If you don't know how to configure your
Linux network cards, please consult the HOWTOs listed in either the 2.4.x 
Section 2.6, the 2.2.x Section 2.7, or the 2.0.x Section 2.8.

Now, the only thing left to do is to configure the IP firewalling tools to
both FORWARD and MASQUERADE the appropriate packets to the correct machine.

** This section ONLY provides the user with the bare minimum firewall ruleset
to get IP Masquerading working.

Once IP MASQ has been successfully tested (as described later in this HOWTO),
please refer to the Stronger IPTABLES ruleset for 2.4.x kernels in Section
6.4.1, the Stronger IPCHAINS ruleset for 2.2.x kernels in Section 6.4.2, and
the Stronger IPFWADM ruleset for 2.0.x kernels in Section 6.4.3. Please note
that these stronger firewall rulesets are more of a template than
anythingelse. For truly secure firewall rulesets, check out the the
requirements section of the HOWTO ( 2.4.x - Section 2.6, 2.2.x - Section 2.7,
2.0.x - Section 2.8.

Instead of manually typing one of these files by hand, I recommend to simply 
browse the Example directory or [http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/LINUX/
ipmasq/examples/rc.firewall-examples.tar.gz] download an archive of all of
these rc.firewall files.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.4.1. Configuring IP Masquerade on Linux 2.4.x Kernels

Please note that IPCHAINS is no longer the primary firewall configuration
tool for the 2.4.x kernels. The new kernels now use the IPTABLES toolkit
though the new 2.4.x kernels CAN still run most old IPCHAINS or IPFWADM
rulesets via a compatiblity module. It should be noted that when in this
mode, NO IPTABLES modules can be loaded. It should also be noted that none of
the 2.2.x IPMASQ modules are compatible with 2.4.x kernels. For a more
detailed reason for these changes, please see the Section 7.39 section.

Ok, as mentioned before, the /etc/rc.d/rc.local script will load the script
called /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall once after every reboot. The script will load
all required IPMASQ modules as well as enable the IPMASQ function. In
advanced setups, this same file would contain very secure firewall rulesets
as well.

Anyway, create the file /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall-2.4 with the following initial
SIMPLE ruleset:

<rc.firewall-2.4 START>

<rc.firewall-2.4 STOP> 

Once you are finished with editing the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset, make it
executable by typing in chmod 700 /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall-2.4

Now that the firewall ruleset is ready, you need to let it run after every
reboot. You could either do this by running it by hand everytime (such a
pain) or add it to the boot scripts. We have covered two methods below:

1. Redhat and Redhat-derived distros:

  * There are two ways to automatically load things in Redhat: /etc/rc.d/
    rc.local or a init script in /etc/rc.d/init.d/. The first method is the
    easiest. All you have to do is add the line:
   
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |echo "Loading the rc.firewall ruleset.. "                      |
    |/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall-2.4                                      |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   
    to the end of the /etc/rc.d/rc.local file and thats it (as described
    earlier in the HOWTO).
   
    The problem with this approach is that the firewall isn't executed until
    the last stages of booting. The preferred approach is to have the
    firewall loaded just after the networking subsystem is loaded. To do
    this, copy the following file into the /etc/rc.d/init.d directory:
   
    <firewall-2.4 START>
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |#!/bin/sh                                                                      |

    |chkconfig --level=345 firewall-2.4 on                          |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    That's it! Now upon boot, the firewall will be loaded automatically.
   

2. Slackware:

  * There are two ways to load things in Slackware: /etc/rc.d/rc.local or
    editing the /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2 file. The first method is the easiest. All
    you have to do is add the line:
   
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |echo "Loading the rc.firewall ruleset.."                       |
    |                                                               |
    |/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall-2.4                                      |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   

Notes on how users might want to change the above firewall ruleset:

You could also have IP Masquerading enabled on a PER MACHINE basis instead of
the above method, which is enabling an ENTIRE TCP/IP network. For example,
say if I wanted only the 192.168.0.2 and 192.168.0.8 hosts to have access to
the Internet and NOT any of the other internal machines. I would change the
in the "Enable simple IP forwarding and Masquerading" section (shown above)
of the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Common mistakes:

It appears that a common mistake with new IP Masq users is to make the first
command simply the following:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|IPTABLES:                                                                  |
|---------                                                                  |
|iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Do NOT make your default policy MASQUERADING. Otherwise, someone can
manipulate their routing tables to tunnel straight back through your gateway,
using it to masquerade their OWN identity!

Again, you can add these lines to the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall file, one of the
other rc files you prefer, or do it manually every time you need IP
Masquerade.

Please see Section 6.4.1 for a detailed guide on a strong IPTABLES ruleset
example. For additional details on IPTABLES usage, please refer to [http://
www.netfilter.org/] http://www.netfilter.org/ for the primary IPTABLES site.

3.4.2. Configuring IP Masquerade on Linux 2.2.x Kernels

Please note that IPFWADM is no longer the firewall tool for manipulating IP
Masquerading rules for both the 2.1.x and 2.2.x kernels. These new kernels
now use the IPCHAINS toolkit. For a more detailed reason for this change,
please see Chapter 7.

Create the file /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall-2.2 with the following initial SIMPLE
ruleset:

<rc.firewall-2.2 START>
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|#!/bin/sh                                                                        |
|#                                                                                |
|# rc.firewall-2.2                                                                |
|#                                                                                |
|#     - Initial SIMPLE IP Masquerade test for 2.1.x and 2.2.x kernels            |
|#       using IPCHAINS.                                                          |
|#                                                                                |
|#       Once IP Masquerading has been tested, with this simple                   |
|#       ruleset, it is highly recommended to use a stronger                      |
|#       IPTABLES ruleset either given later in this HOWTO or                     |

<rc.firewall-2.2 STOP> 

Once you are finished with editing the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset, make it
executable by typing in chmod 700 /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall

Now that the firewall ruleset is ready, you need to let it run after every
reboot. You could either do this by running it by hand everytime (such a
pain) or add it to the boot scripts. We have covered two methods below:

1. Redhat and Redhat-derived distros:

  * There are two ways to automatically load things in Redhat: /etc/rc.d/
    rc.local or a init script in /etc/rc.d/init.d/. The first method is the
    easiest. All you have to do is add the line:
   
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |echo "Loading the rc.firewall ruleset.."                       |
    |/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall-2.2                                      |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   
    to the end of the /etc/rc.d/rc.local file and thats it (as described
    earlier in the HOWTO).
   
    The problem with this approach is that the firewall isn't executed until
    the last stages of booting. The preferred approach is to have the
    firewall loaded just after the networking subsystem is loaded. To do
    this, copy the following file into the /etc/rc.d/init.d directory:
   
    <firewall-2.2 START>
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |#!/bin/sh                                                                      |

    |chkconfig --level=345 firewall-2.2 on                          |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    That's it! Now upon boot, the firewall will be loaded automatically.
   

2. Slackware:

  * There are two ways to load things in Slackware: /etc/rc.d/rc.local or
    editing the /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2 file. The first method is the easiest. All
    you have to do is add the line:
   
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |echo "Loading the rc.firewall ruleset.."                       |
    |                                                               |
    |/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall-2.2                                      |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   
    to the end of the /etc/rc.d/rc.local file and thats it. The problem with
    this approach is that if you are running a STRONG firewall ruleset, the
    firewall isn't executed until the last stages of booting. The preferred
    approach is to have the firewall loaded just after the networking
    subsystem is loaded. For now, the HOWTO only covers how to do so using /
    etc/rc.d/rc.local. If you want a stronger system, I recommend you check
    out Section 10 of TrinityOS found in the links section at the bottom of
    this HOWTO.
   

Notes on how users might want to change the above firewall ruleset:

You could also have IP Masquerading enabled on a PER MACHINE basis instead of
the above method, which is enabling an ENTIRE TCP/IP network. For example,
say if I wanted only the 192.168.0.2 and 192.168.0.8 hosts to have access to
the Internet and NOT any of the other internal machines. I would change the
in the "Enable simple IP forwarding and Masquerading" section (shown above)
of the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset.

|#  NOTE:  The following is an example used in addition to the simple           |

|#         "24" bit subnet mask connecting to the Internet on interface $EXTIF. |
|#                                                                              |
|#         ** Please change the network number, subnet mask, and the Internet   |
|#         ** connection interface name to match your internal LAN setup        |
|#                                                                              |
|$IPCHAINS -P forward DENY                                                      |
|$IPCHAINS -A forward -i $EXTIF -s 192.168.0.2/32 -j MASQ                       |
|$IPCHAINS -A forward -i $EXTIF -s 192.168.0.8/32 -j MASQ                       |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Common mistakes:

What appears to be a common mistake with new IP MASQ users is to make the
first command:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|$IPCHAINS -P forward masquerade                                            |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Do NOT make your default policy MASQUERADING. Otherwise, someone can
manipulate their routing tables to tunnel straight back through your gateway,
using it to masquerade their OWN identity!

Again, you can add these lines to the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall file, one of the
other rc files you prefer, or do it manually every time you need IP
Masquerade.

Please see Section 6.4.2 for a detailed guide on IPCHAINS and a strong
IPCHAINS ruleset example. For additional details on IPCHAINS usage, please

Once you are finished with editing the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset, make it
executable by typing in "chmod 700 /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall"

Now that the firewall ruleset is ready to go, you need to let it run after
every reboot. You could either do this by running it by hand everytime (such
a pain) or add it to the boot scripts. We have covered two methods below:

Redhat and Redhat-derived distros:

  * There are two ways to automatically load things in Redhat: /etc/rc.d/
    rc.local or a init script in /etc/rc.d/init.d/. The first method is the
    easiest. All you have to do is add the line:
   
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |echo "Loading the rc.firewall ruleset.."                       |
    |                                                               |
    |/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall                                          |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   
    The problem with this approach is that the firewall isn't executed until
    the last stages of booting. The preferred approach is to have the
    firewall loaded just after the networking subsystem is loaded. To do
    this, copy the following file into the /etc/rc.d/init.d directory:
   
    <firewall-2.0 START>
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |#!/bin/sh                                                                      |

    |chkconfig --level=345 firewall-2.0 on                          |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    That's it! Now upon boot, the firewall will be loaded automatically.
   

Slackware:

  * There are two ways to automatically load things in Slackware: /etc/rc.d/
    rc.local or editing the /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2 file. The first method is the
    easiest. All you have to do is add the line:
   
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |echo "Loading the rc.firewall ruleset.."                       |
    |                                                               |
    |/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall-2.0                                      |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   
    to the end of the /etc/rc.d/rc.local file and thats it. The problem with
    this approach is that if you are running a STRONG firewall ruleset, the
    firewall isn' t executed until the last stages of booting. The preferred
    approach is to have the firewall loaded just after the networking
    subsystem is loaded. For now, the HOWTO only covers how to do so using /
    etc/rc.d/rc.local. If you want the strong er system, I recommend you
    check out Section 10 of TrinityOS found in the links section at the
    bottom of this HOWTO.
   

Notes on how users might want to change the above firewall ruleset:

You could have also enabled IP Masquerading on a PER MACHINE basis instead of
the above method enabling an ENTIRE TCP/IP network. For example, say if I
wanted only the 192.168.0.2 and 192.168.0.8 hosts to have access to the
Internet and NOT any of the other internal machines. I would change the in
the "Enable simple IP forwarding and Masquerading" section (shown above) of
the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset.

|#                                                                                |

Common mistakes:

What appears to be a common mistake with new IP Masq users is to make the
first command:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|ipfwadm -F -p masquerade                                                   |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Do NOT make your default policy MASQUERADING. Otherwise, someone who has the
ability to manipulate their routing tables will be able to tunnel straight
back through your gateway, using it to masquerade their OWN identity!

Again, you can add these lines to the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall file, one of the
other rc files (if you prefer), or manually add those lines every time you
need IP Masquerade.

Please see Section 6.4.2 and Section 6.4.3for a detailed guide and stronger
examples of IPCHAINS and IPFWADM ruleset examples.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 4. Configuring the other internal to-be MASQed machines

Besides setting the appropriate IP address for each internal MASQed machine
(either statically or though DHCP), you should also set each internal machine
with the appropriate gateway IP address of the Linux MASQ server and required
DNS servers. In general, this is rather straight forward. You simply enter
the address of your Linux host (192.168.0.1 is used throughout this HOWTO) as
the machine's gateway address.

For the Domain Name Service (DNS), you add in any DNS servers that are
available to you to use. The most apparent one(s) should be the DNS servers
that your Linux server uses. You can optionally add any "domain search"
suffix as well for quicker connections, etc.

After you have properly reconfigured the internal MASQed machines, remember
to restart their appropriate network services or reboot them if need be.

The following configuration instructions assume that you are using a Class C
network with 192.168.0.1 as your Linux MASQ server's address. Please note
that 192.168.0.0 and 192.168.0.255 are reserved TCP/IP address per RFC1918
for uses just like enabling IP Masquerade services.

As it stands, the following Platforms have been tested as internal MASQed
machines. This is only an EXAMPLE of all compatible OSes out there:

  * Apple Macintosh OS and OS-X (with MacTCP or Open Transport or the BSD TCP
    /IP stack)
   
  * AT&T Unix (Caldera)
   
  * *BSD systems including Free/Net/Open/BSDi/386/etc.
   
  * Commodore Amiga (with AmiTCP or AS225-stack)
   
  * Digital VAX Stations 3520 and 3100 with UCX (TCP/IP stack for VMS)
   
  * Digital Ultrix, Digital Unix (Compaq Tru/64)
   
  * HP HP/UX
   
  * IBM AIX running on RS/6000, PowerPC, etc.
   
  * IBM OS/2 (including Warp v3)
   
  * IBM OS400 running on a AS/400
   
  * Linux distributions from vendors like Caldera, Corel, Debian, Mandrake,
    Redhat, Slackware, SuSe, etc. running various kernels like 1.2.x, 1.3.x,
    2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.x, 2.3.x, 2.4.x, etc.
   
  * Microsoft DOS (with NCSA Telnet package, DOS Trumpet works partially)
   
  * Microsoft Windows 3.1 (with the Netmanage or FTP packages)
   
  * Microsoft Windows For Workgroup 3.11 (with a TCP/IP package)
   
  * Microsoft Windows 95, OSR2, 98, 98se, Me
   
  * Microsoft Windows NT 3.51, 4.0, 2000, XP - (both workstation
    (professional) and server versions)
   
  * Novell Netware 4.01, 5.x, etc. with the TCP/IP service
   
  * SCO Openserver (v3.2.4.2 and 5) and UnixWare (AT&T Unix)
   
  * Sun Solaris 2.51, 2.6, 7, 8
   
  * heheh.. what else am I missing?
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1. Configuring Microsoft Windows 95 and OSR2

 1. ** Please note that some prompts might be different based upon the build
    version of Windows95 you are running **
   
    If you haven't installed your network card and adapter driver, do so now.
    Descriptions to perform this step is beyond the scope of this document
    and though it is fairly simple, if you haven't done this before, please
    seek assitance.
   
 2. Go to the 'Control Panel' --> 'Network'.
   
 3. Click on Add --> Protocol --> Manufacture: Microsoft --> Protocol: 'TCP/
    IP protocol' if you don't already have it installed.
   
 4. Highlight the TCP/IP item bound to your correct Windows95 network card
    e.g. (TCP/IP --> Intel EtherExpress Pro/100+) and select 'Properties'.
    Here, you have two options: configure a static address or use DHCP.
    Static addresses are simple but require that you NEVER configure
    duplication IPs on different machines. The alternative is DHCP which
    automatically configures all DHCP-enabled workstations things like IP
    addresses, DNS servers, etc. from a central server (typically the Linux
    MASQ server).
   
    DHCP enabled:
   
    To use DHCP, simply click on the "Use DHCP to assign addresses" button.
    Please note that configuring a DHCP server is beyond the scope of this
    HOWTO but it is fully covered in TrinityOS and other Linux HOWTOs.
   
    Static Addresses:
   
    Now goto the 'IP Address' tab and set IP Address to 192.168.0.x, (1 < x <
    255), and set the Subnet Mask to 255.255.255.0
   
 5. Now select the "Gateway" tab and add 192.168.0.1 as your gateway under 
    'Gateway' and hit "Add".
   
 6. Under the 'DNS Configuration' tab, make sure to put enter in a name for
    this machine and specify your official domain name. If you don't have
    your own domain, enter in the domain of your ISP. Next, you need to
    specify the DNS servers you plan on using.
   
    DHCP: No entries are required as this is configured dynamically via DHCP.
   
    STATIC: Add all of the DNS servers that your Linux MASQ server uses
    (usually found in /etc/resolv.conf). Usually these DNS servers are
    located at your ISP though you could be running either your own Caching
    or Authoritative DNS server on your Linux MASQ server as well. Again,
    setting up DNS services is beyond the scope of this HOWTO but it is
    covered by TrinityOS as well as the LDP's DNS HOWTO.
   
    Optionally, you can add any appropriate domain search suffixes as well.
    This allows users to simply type in the hostname of the destination
    computer instead of the fully qualified domain name (FQDN). This is
    similar to the PATH function for finding common Unix commands.
   
 7. Leave all of the other settings alone as they are unless (even dangerous)
    if you don't know what you're doing.
   
 8. Click 'OK' in all dialog boxes and restart your system.
   
 9. As an initial test, Ping the Linux MASQ server to test the network
    connection: 'Start/Run', type: ping 192.168.0.1(This is only an INTERNAL
    LAN connection test, you might not be able to ping the outside world
    yet.) If you don't see "replies" to your PINGs, please verify your
    network configuration.
   
10. You can optionally create a HOSTS file in the C:\Windows directory so
    that you can ping the "hostname" of the machines on your LAN without the
    need for a DNS server. There is an example called HOSTS.SAM in the C:\
    windows directory for an example.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2. Configuring Windows NT

 

 1. If you haven't installed your network card and adapter driver, do so now.
    Descriptions to perform this task is beyond the scope of this document.
   
 2. Go to 'Control Panel' --> 'Network' --> Protocols
   
 3. Add the TCP/IP Protocol and related Components from the 'Add Software'
    menu if you don't have TCP/IP service installed already.
   
 4. Under 'Network Software and Adapter Cards' section, highlight the 'TCP/IP
    Protocol' in the 'Installed Network Software' selection box.
   
 5. In 'TCP/IP Configuration', select the appropriate adapter, e.g. [1]Intel
    EtherExpress Pro/100+. Then set the IP Address to 192.168.0.x (1 < x <
    255), then set the Subnet Mask to 255.255.255.0 and Default Gateway to
    192.168.0.1.
   
 6. Do not enable any of the following options (unless you know what you are
    doing):
   
      + 'Automatic DHCP Configuration' : Unless you have a DHCP server
        running on your network.
       
      + Put anything in the 'WINS Server' input areas : Unless you have setup
        one or more WINS servers.
       
      + Enable IP Forwardings : Unless you are routing on your NT machine and
        really -REALLY- know EXACTLY what you're doing.
       
   
 7. Click 'DNS', fill in the appropriate information that your Linux host
    uses (usually found in /etc/resolv.conf) and then click 'OK' when you're
    done.
   
 8. Click 'Advanced', be sure to DISABLE 'DNS for Windows Name Resolution'
    and 'Enable LMHOSTS lookup' unless you known what these options do. If
    you want to use a LMHOSTS file, it is stored in C:\winnt\system32\drivers
    \etc.
   
 9. Click 'OK' on all dialog boxes and restart the system.
   
10. As an initial test, ping the Linux MASQ server to test the network
    connection: 'File/Run', type: ping 192.168.0.1(This is only an INTERNAL
    LAN connection test, you you might not be able to ping the outside world
    yet.) If you don't see any "replies" to your PINGs, please verify your
    network configuration.
   

 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.3. Configuring Windows for Workgroup 3.11

 

 1. If you haven't installed your network card and adapter driver, do so now.
    Descriptions to perform this task is beyond the scope of this document.
   
 2. Install the TCP/IP 32b package if you haven't already.
   
 3. In 'Main'/'Windows Setup'/'Network Setup', click on 'Drivers'.
   
 4. Highlight 'Microsoft TCP/IP-32 3.11b' in the 'Network Drivers' section,
    click 'Setup'.
   
 5. Set the IP Address to 192.168.0.x (1 < x < 255), then set the Subnet Mask
    to 255.255.255.0 and Default Gateway to 192.168.0.1
   
 6. Do not enable any of the following options (unless you know what you are
    doing):
   
      + 'Automatic DHCP Configuration' : Unless you have a DHCP server
        running on your network.
       
      + Put anything in the 'WINS Server' input areas : Unless you have setup
        one or more WINS servers.
       
   
 7. Click 'DNS', fill in the appropriate information your Linux host uses
    (usually found in /etc/resolv.conf). Then click 'OK' when you're done
    with it.
   
 8. Click 'Advanced', check 'Enable DNS for Windows Name Resolution' and 
    'Enable LMHOSTS lookup' found in c:\windows.
   
 9. Click 'OK' in all dialog boxes and restart the system.
   
10. As an initial test, ping the linux box to test the network connection: 
    'File/Run', type: ping 192.168.0.1 (This is only an INTERNAL LAN
    connection test so you might not be able to ping the outside world yet.)
    If you don't see "replies" to your PINGs, please verify your network
    configuration.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.4. Configuring UNIX Based Systems

 

 1. If you haven't installed your network card and either re-configured the
    network subsystem or recompiled your kernel with the appropriate adapter
    driver, do so now. Descriptions to perform this task is beyond the scope
    of this document but are covered in the Networking HOWTO.  
   
 2. Install TCP/IP networking, such as the net-tools package, if you don't
    have it already.
   
 3. Set IPADDR to 192.168.0.x (1 < x < 255), then set NETMASK to
    255.255.255.0, GATEWAY to 192.168.0.1, and BROADCAST to 192.168.0.255.
   
      + Redhat (Mandrake / TurboLinux / etc): You can edit the /etc/sysconfig
        /network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 file, or simply do so through the Control
        Panel (Linuxconf).
       
      + Slackware: You need to edit the /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 file to configure
        the network subsystem.
       
      + To Add: Debian, Suse, Caldera, etc. Please email dranch@trinnet.net
        if you can tell me what distro uses what files to configure the
        networking subsystem.
       
   
    Beyond this, most Linux distributions use significantly different network
    configuration mechanisms let alone other UNIXes such as SunOS, BSDi,
    Solaris, AIX, TruUnix, FreeBSD, etc.). Please refer to your specific UNIX
    documentation for more details.
   
 4. Add your domain name service (DNS) and domain search suffix in /etc/
    resolv.conf and for the appropreiate UNIX versions, edit the /etc/
    nsswitch.conf file to enable DNS services.
   
 5. You may also want to update your /etc/networks file depending on your
    version of UNIX and the system's settings.
   
 6. Restart the appropriate services, or simply restart your system.
   
 7. As an initial test, run the ping command: ping 192.168.0.1 to test the
    connection to your gateway machine. (This is only an INTERNAL LAN
    connection test, so you might not be able to ping the outside world yet.)
    If you don't see "replies" to your PINGs, please verify your network
    configuration.
   

 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.5. Configuring DOS using NCSA Telnet package

 

 1. If you haven't installed your network card, do so now. Descriptions to
    perform this task is beyond the scope of this document.
   
 2. Load the appropriate packet driver. For example: an NE2000 Ethernet card
    set for I/O port 300 and IRQ 10, would need to be issued nwpd 0x60 10
    0x300
   
 3. Make a new directory, and then unpack the NCSA Telnet package: pkunzip
    tel2308b.zip
   
 4. Use a text editor to open the config.tel file
   
 5. Set myip=192.168.0.x (1 < x < 255), and netmask=255.255.255.0
   
 6. In this example, you should set hardware=packet, interrupt=10, ioaddr=60
   
 7. You should have at least one individual machine specified as the gateway,
    i.e. the Linux host:
   
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |     name=default                                              |
    |     host=yourlinuxhostname                                    |
    |     hostip=192.168.0.1                                        |
    |     gateway=1                                                 |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   
 8. Have another specified as a domain name service:
   
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |     name=dns.domain.com ; hostip=123.123.123.123; nameserver=1|
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   
    Note: substitute the appropriate information about the DNS according what
    your Linux host uses
   
 9. Save your config.tel file
   
10. As an initial test, ping the Linux MASQ server to test the network
    connection: ping 192.168.0.1 If you don't receive any replies, please
    verify your network configuration.
   

 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.6. Configuring MacOS Based System Running MacTCP

 1. If you haven't installed the appropriate driver software for your
    Ethernet adapter, do so now. Descriptions to perform this task is beyond
    the scope of this document.
   
 2. Open the MacTCP control panel. Select the appropriate network driver
    (Ethernet, NOT EtherTalk) and click on the 'More...' button.
   
 3. Under 'Obtain Address:', click 'Manually'.
   
 4. Under 'IP Address:', select class C from the popup menu. Ignore the rest
    of the dialog box sections.
   
 5. Fill in the appropriate information under 'Domain Name Server
    Information:'.
   
 6. Under 'Gateway Address:', enter 192.168.0.1
   
 7. Click 'OK' to save the settings. In the main window of the MacTCP control
    panel, enter the IP address of your Mac (192.168.0.x, 1 < x < 255) in the
    'IP Address:' box.
   
 8. Close the MacTCP control panel. If a dialog box pops up, notifying you to
    do so, then restart the system.
   
 9. You may optionally ping the Linux box to test the network connection. If
    you have the freeware program MacTCP Watcher , click on the 'Ping'
    button, and enter the address of your Linux box (192.168.0.1) in the
    dialog window that pops up. (This is only an INTERNAL LAN connection
    test, you can't ping the outside world yet.) If you don't see "replies"
    to your PINGs, please verify your network configuration.
   
10. You can optionally create a Hosts file in your System Folder so that you
    can use the hostnames of the machines on your LAN. The file should
    already exist in your System Folder, and should contain some
    (commented-out) sample entries which you can modify according to your
    needs.
   

 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.7. Configuring MacOS Based System Running Open Transport

 

 1. If you haven't installed the appropriate driver software for your
    Ethernet adapter, do so now. Descriptions to perform this task is beyond
    the scope of this document.
   
 2. Open the TCP/IP Control Panel and choose 'User Mode ...' from the Edit
    menu. Make sure the user mode is set to at least 'Advanced' and click the
    'OK' button.
   
 3. Choose 'Configurations...' from the File menu. Select your 'Default'
    configuration and click the 'Duplicate...' button. Enter 'IP Masq' (or
    something to let you know that this is a special configuration) in the 
    'Duplicate Configuration' dialog, it will probably say something like 
    'Default copy'. Then click the 'OK' button, and the 'Make Active' button
   
 4. Select 'Ethernet' from the 'Connect via:' pop-up.
   
 5. Select the appropriate item from the 'Configure:' pop-up. If you don't
    know which option to choose, you probably should re-select your 'Default'
    configuration and quit. I use 'Manually'.
   
 6. Enter the IP address of your Mac (192.168.0.x, 1 < x < 255) in the 'IP
    Address:' box.
   
 7. Enter 255.255.255.0 in the 'Subnet mask:' box.
   
 8. Enter 192.168.0.1 in the 'Router address:' box.
   
 9. Enter the IP addresses of your domain name servers in the 'Name server
    addr.:' box.
   
10. Enter the name of your Internet domain (e.g. 'microsoft.com') in the 
    'Starting domain name' box under 'Implicit Search Path:'.
   
11. The following procedures are optional. Incorrect values may cause erratic
    behavior. If you're not sure, it's probably better to leave them blank,
    unchecked and/or un-selected. Remove any information from those fields,
    if necessary. As far as I know, there is no way to use the TCP/IP dialogs
    to tell the system not to use a previously selected alternate "Hosts"
    file. If you know, I would be interested.
   
    Check the '802.3' if your network requires 802.3 frame types.
   
12. Click the 'Options...' button to make sure that the TCP/IP is active. I
    use the 'Load only when needed' option. If you continuously run and quit
    TCP/IP applications without rebooting your machine, you may find that
    unchecking the 'Load only when needed' option will prevent/reduce the
    effects on your machine's memory management. With the item unchecked, the
    TCP/IP protocol stacks are always loaded and available for use. If
    checked, the TCP/IP stacks are automatically loaded when needed and
    un-loaded when not. It's the loading and unloading process that can cause
    your machine's memory to become fragmented.
   
13. You may ping the Linux box to test the network connection. If you have
    the freeware program MacTCP Watcher, click on the 'Ping' button, and
    enter the address of your Linux box (192.168.0.1) in the dialog box that
    pops up. (This is only an INTERNAL LAN connection test, you can't ping
    the outside world yet.) If you don't see "replies" to your PINGs, please
    verify your network configuration.
   
14. You can optionally create a Hosts file in your System Folder so that you
    can use the hostnames of the machines on your LAN. The file may or may
    not already exist in your System Folder. If so, it should contain some
    (commented-out) sample entries which you can modify according to your
    needs. If not, you can get a copy of the file from a system running
    MacTCP, or just create your own (it follows a subset of the Unix /etc/
    hosts file format, described on RFC1035). Once you've created the file,
    open the TCP/IP control panel, click on the 'Select Hosts File...'
    button, and open the Hosts file.
   
15. Click the close box or choose 'Close' or 'Quit' from the File menu, and
    then click the 'Save' button to save the changes you have made.
   
16. The changes take effect immediately, but rebooting the system won't hurt.

4.8. Configuring Novell network using DNS

 

 1. If you haven't installed the appropriate driver software for your
    Ethernet adapter, do so now. Descriptions to perform this task is beyond
    the scope of this document.
   
 2. Downloaded tcpip16.exe from The Novell LanWorkPlace page

 6. Issue a ping command: ping 192.168.0.1 to test the connection to your
    gateway machine. (This is only an INTERNAL LAN connection test, you can't
    ping the outside world yet.) If you don't see "replies" to your PINGs,
    please verify your network configuration.

4.9. Configuring OS/2 Warp

 

 1. If you haven't installed the appropriate driver software for your
    Ethernet adapter, do so now. Descriptions to perform this task is beyond
    the scope of this document.
   
 2. Install the TCP/IP protocol if you don't have it already.
   
 3. Go to Programs/TCP/IP (LAN) / TCP/IP Settings
   
 4. In 'Network', add your TCP/IP Address (192.168.0.x) and set your netmask
    (255.255.255.0)
   
 5. Under 'Routing', press 'Add'. Set the Type to 'default' and type the IP
    Address of your Linux Box in the Field 'Router Address'. (192.168.0.1).
   
 6. Set the same DNS (Nameserver) Address that your Linux host uses in 
    'Hosts'.
   
 7. Close the TCP/IP control panel. Say yes to the following question(s).
   
 8. Reboot your system
   
 9. You may ping the Linux box to test the network configuration. Type 'ping
    192.168.0.1' in a 'OS/2 Command prompt Window'. When ping packets are
    received all is ok.

4.10. Configuring OS/400 on a IBM AS/400

The descriptions to configure TCP/IP on OS/400 version V4R1M0 running on a AS
/400 is beyond the scope of this document.

1) To perform any communications configuration tasks on your AS/400, you must
have the special authority of *IOSYSCFG (I/O System Configuration) defined in
your user profile. You can check the characteristics of your user profile
with the DSPUSRPRF command.

2) Type GO CFGTCP command th reach the Configure TCP/IP menu.

3) Select Option 2 - Work with TCP/IP Routes.

4) Enter a 1 on the Opt field to add a route. * In Route Destination type *
DFTROUTE * In Subnet Mask type *NONE * In Type of Service type *NORMAL * In
Nex Hop type the address of your gataway (the Linux box)

Chapter 5. Testing IP Masquerade

Finally, it's time to give IP Masquerading an official try after all this
hard work. If you haven't already rebooted your Linux box, do so to make sure
the machines boots ok, executes the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset, etc. Next,
make sure that both the internal LAN connection and connection of your Linux
hosts to the Internet is okay.

Follow these -11- tests to make sure all aspects of your MASQ setup is
running properly:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.1. Loading up the rc.firewall ruleset

Step One: run the command "/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall".

Does it load with some strange errors? Here are some exmaples and help to fix
them:

  * Problem #1:
   
     
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |ip_tables, Using /lib/modules/2.4.2-2/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.o     |
    |/lib/modules/2.4.2-2/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.o: init_module: Device |
    |or resource busy                                                                |
    |Hint: insmod errors can be caused by incorrect module parameters, including     |
    |invalid IO or IRQ parameters                                                    |
    |                                                                                |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   
    Run the command "/sbin/lsmod" and make sure the module "ipchains.o" is
    NOT installed. If it is installed, your machine (most likely Redhat-7.x
    based) is probably trying to load an IPCHAINS ruleset which is
    incompatible with IPTABLES.
   
    To disable this from happening in the future, run the command:
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |   chkconfig --level=2345 ipchains off                         |
    |                                                               |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   
    To remove the "ipchains" module without rebooting, run the command:
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |   /sbin/rmmod ipchains                                        |
    |                                                               |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    and the re-try to load the rc.firewall ruleset.
   
  * Problem #2:
   
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |    .                                                          |
    |    .                                                          |
    |    Creating a DROP chain..                                    |
    |    iptables v1.2.3: log-level `info' ambiguous                |
    |    .                                                          |
    |    .                                                          |
    |                                                               |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   
    Your version of IPTABLES it too old. You need to upgrade it with a newer
    version via an updated RPM, DEB, or via compiling up the source. You can
    get an updated version from your Linux distribution manufacturer or from
    the NetFilter WWW site. This is all covered in the Section 2.6 section.
   
  * Problem #3:
   
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |    No such file:                                              |
    |                                                               |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   
    Did you copy this rc.firewall file from a DOS machine? Load the
    rc.firewall file in a binary editor such as ViM (vim -b /etc/rc.d/
    rc.firewall) and make sure that every line is NOT finished with a ^M.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2. Testing internal MASQ client PC connectivity

  * Step Two: Testing internal MASQ client PC connectivity
   
    From an internal MASQed computer, try pinging its local IP address (i.e. 
    ping 192.168.0.10 ). This will verify that TCP/IP is correctly working on
    the local machine. Almost ALL modern operating systems have built-in
    support for the "ping" command. If this ping doesn't work, make sure that
    TCP/IP is correctly configured on the MASQed PC as described earlier in 
    Chapter 4 of this HOWTO. The output should look something like the
    following (hit Control-C to abort the ping):
   
    ------------------------------------                             
    masq-client# ping 192.168.0.10                                   
    PING 192.168.0.10 (192.168.0.10): 56 data bytes

    ------------------------------------                             
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.3. Testing internal MASQ client to MASQ server connectivity

  * Step Three: Testing internal MASQ client to MASQ server connectivity
   
    Next, from the same internal MASQed computer, try pinging the the IP
    address of the Linux MASQ server's INTERNAL interface (i.e. ping
    192.168.0.1 ). This will verify that TCP/IP is correctly working on both
    the local and Linux MASQ machine. Almost ALL modern operating systems
    have built-in support for the "ping" command. If this ping doesn't work,
    make sure that TCP/IP is correctly configured on the MASQed Server as
    described by the various Network HOWTOs (URLs can be found in the
    requirements section for your 2.4.x kernel in Section 2.6, 2.2.x kernel
    in Section 2.7, or 2.0.x kernel in Section 2.8). The output should look
    something like the following (hit Control-C to abort the ping):
   
    ------------------------------------                             
    masq-client# ping 192.168.0.1                                    
    PING 192.168.0.1 (192.168.0.1): 56 data bytes                    
    64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=0.8 ms        
    64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=255 time=0.4 ms        
    64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=255 time=0.4 ms        
    64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=255 time=0.5 ms        
    ^C                                                               
                                                                     
    --- 192.168.0.1 ping statistics ---                              
    4 packets transmitted, 4 packets received, 0% packet loss        
    round-trip min/avg/max = 0.4/0.5/0.8 ms                          
    ------------------------------------                             
   
    If the ping failed, check the network connection between the MASQ server
    and the PC. If it's a DIRECT Ethernet connection (no hub or switch), you
    MUST have a "Ethernet cross-over cable". These cables are common and can
    be found at any computer store. Without this cable, the NICs (network
    cards) will not give you a "LINK" light. If you are using a hub or
    switch, make sure the ports connected to the MASQ server and MASQed
    client machine have a LINK light. If they do and the pings STILL don't
    work or there is a lot of packet loss, try different ports on the hub/
    switch (it not all that uncommon to have hub/switch ports die). Finally,
    if things still don't work perfectly, try replacing each of the NICs in
    the machines. You would be surprised how many people I've helped have
    found that their NIC cards were going bad and caused them all kinds of
    grief.
   

 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.4. Testing internal MASQ server connectivity

  * Step Four: Testing internal MASQ server connectivity
   
    On the MASQ server, ping the internal IP address of the MASQ server's
    network interface card (i.e. ping 192.168.0.1). If this ping doesn't
    work, make sure that TCP/IP is correctly configured on the MASQed Server
    as described by the various Network HOWTOs (URLs can be found in the
    requirements section for your 2.4.x kernel in Section 2.6, 2.2.x kernel
    in Section 2.7, or 2.0.x kernel in Section 2.8). The output should look
    something like the following (hit Control-C to abort the ping):
   
    --------------------------------------                           
    masq-server# ping 192.168.0.1                                    
    PING 192.168.0.1 (192.168.0.1): 56 data bytes                    
    64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=0.8 ms

5.5. Testing internal MASQ server to MASQ client connectivity

  * Step Five: Testing internal MASQ server to MASQ client connectivity
   
    Next from MASQed server, try pinging the IP address of one of the
    internal MASQ client computers (i.e. ping 192.168.0.10 ). This will
    verify that TCP/IP is correctly working on both the local server machine
    and on the MASQ client machine. If this ping doesn't work, make sure that
    TCP/IP is correctly configured on the MASQed PC as described earlier in 
    Chapter 4 of this HOWTO. Also be sure that the cabling is correct
    (Ethernet: the NICs connecting the internal MASQ PC and the MASQ server
    have the "link" light lit up). If the ping does work, the output should
    look something like the following (hit Control-C to abort the ping):
   
    ------------------------------------                             
    masq-server# ping 192.168.0.10                                   
    PING 192.168.0.10 (192.168.0.10): 56 data bytes

    ------------------------------------                             
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.6. Testing External MASQ server Internet connectivity

  * Step Six: Testing external MASQ server to Internet connectivity
   
    From the MASQ server, ping the external IP address of the MASQ server's
    EXTERNAL network interface that is connected to the Internet. This
    address might be a Ethernet interface, a PPP interface, etc. connection
    to your ISP. If you don't know what this external IP address is, run the
    Linux command "/sbin/ifconfig" on the MASQ server itself to get the
    Internet address. The output should look something like the following (we
    are looking for the IP address of eth0):
   
    ------------------------------------                                    
    eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:08:C7:A4:CC:5B                 
              inet addr:12.13.14.15  Bcast:12.13.14.255  Mask:255.255.255.0 
              UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1            
              RX packets:6108459 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0      
              TX packets:5422798 errors:8 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:8    
              collisions:4675 txqueuelen:100                                
              Interrupt:11 Base address:0xfcf0                              
    ------------------------------------                                    
   
    As you can see from the above, the external IP address is "12.13.14.15"
    for this example. So, now that you have your IP address after running the
    "ipconfig" command, ping your external IP address. This will confirm that
    the MASQ server has full network connectivity. The output should look
    something like the following (hit Control-C to abort the ping):
   
    -------------------------------------                            
    masq-server# ping 12.13.14.15                                    
    PING 12.13.14.15 (12.13.14.15): 56 data bytes                    
    64 bytes from 12.13.14.15: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=0.8 ms        
    64 bytes from 12.13.14.15: icmp_seq=1 ttl=255 time=0.4 ms        
    64 bytes from 12.13.14.15: icmp_seq=2 ttl=255 time=0.4 ms        
    64 bytes from 12.13.14.15: icmp_seq=3 ttl=255 time=0.5 ms        
    ^C                                                               
                                                                     
    --- 12.13.14.15 ping statistics ---

    round-trip min/avg/max = 0.4/0.5/0.8 ms                          
    -------------------------------------                            
   
    If either of these tests doesn't work, you need to go back and double
    check your network cabling and verify that the two network interfaces on
    the MASQ server are seen in "dmesg". An example of this output would be
    the following towards the END of the "dmesg" command:

    -------------------------------------                                       
   
    Also be sure that the cabling is correct (Ethernet: the NICs connecting
    the external MASQ server to your ISP has the "link" light lit up).
    Finally, make sure that TCP/IP is correctly configured on the MASQed
    Server as described by the various Network HOWTOs (URLs can be found in
    the requirements section for your 2.4.x kernel in Section 2.6, 2.2.x
    kernel in Section 2.7, or 2.0.x kernel in Section 2.8).
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.7. Testing internal MASQ client to external MASQ server connectivity

 

  * Step Seven: Testing internal MASQ client to external MASQ server
    connectivity
   
    From an internal MASQed computer, ping the IP address of the MASQ
    server's EXTERNAL TCP/IP address obtained in Step FIVE above. This
    address could be from your Ethernet, PPP, etc. interface which is
    ultimately the address connected to your ISP. This ping test will prove
    that Linux masquerading (ICMP Masquerading specifically) and IP
    forwarding is working.
   
    If everthing thing is working correctly, the output should look something
    like the following (hit Control-C to abort the ping):
   
    -------------------------------------                            
    masq-client# ping 12.13.14.15                                    
    PING 12.13.14.15 (12.13.14.15): 56 data bytes

    round-trip min/avg/max = 0.4/0.5/0.8 ms                          
    -------------------------------------                            
   
    If this test doesn't work, first make sure that the "Default Gateway" on
    the MASQed PC is pointing to the IP address on the MASQ -SERVERs-
    INTERNAL NIC. Also double check that the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall script was
    run without any errors. Just as a test, try re-running the /etc/rc.d/
    rc.firewall script now to see if it runs OK. Also, though most kernels
    support it by default, make sure that you enabled "ICMP Masquerading" in
    the kernel comfiguration and "IP Forwarding" in your /etc/rc.d/
    rc.firewall script.
   
    If you still can't get things to work, take a look at the output from the
    following commands run on the Linux MASQ SERVER:
   
      + "ifconfig" : Make sure the interface for your Internet connection (be
        it ppp0, eth0, etc.) is UP and you have the correct IP address for
        the Internet connection. An example of this output is shown in STEP
        FIVE above.
       
      + "netstat -rn" : Make sure your default gateway (the column with an IP
        address in the Gateway column) is set. An example of this output
        might look like:
        -------------------------------------                                          
        masq-server# netstat -rn

        -------------------------------------                                          
        Notice the very LAST line that starts with 0.0.0.0? Notice that it
        also has an IP address in the "Gateway" field? You should specify an
        IP address for your specific setup in that field (this is typically
        done automatically when your Internet connection is enabled).
       
      + "cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward" : Make sure it says "1" so that
        Linux forwarding is enabled
       
      + Run the command "/sbin/ipchains -n -L" for 2.2.x users or "/sbin/
        ipfwadm -F -l" for 2.0.x users. Specifically, look for the FORWARDing
        section to make sure you have MASQ enabled. An example of an IPCHAINS
        output might look like for users using the Simple rc.firewall
        ruleset:
        ------------------------------------

5.8. Testing external MASQ ICMP forwarding

 

  * Step Eight: Testing external MASQ ICMP forwarding
   
    From an internal MASQed computer, ping a static TCP/IP address (NOT a
    machine by DNS name) out on the Internet (i.e. ping 152.2.210.81 (this
    technically the DNS name "metalab.unc.edu" which is home of MetaLabs'
    Linux Archive). If this works, it should look something like the result
    below and this ultimately shows that ICMP Masquerading is working
    properly. (hit Control-C to abort the ping):

    -------------------------------------                            
   
    If this didn't work, again check your Internet connection. Make sure that
    the MASQ server itself can ping this address. If this works from the MASQ
    server, make sure you are using the simple rc.firewall ruleset and that
    you have ICMP Masqurading compiled into the Linux kernel.
   
    Finally, make sure that the ruleset which enables IP MASQ is pointing to
    the correct EXTERNAL interface. PPPoE users should use the MASQ servers's
    logical PPP interface such as "ppp0" and /NOT/ the physical external
    interface like "eth0".

5.9. Testing MASQ functionality without DNS

 

  * Step Nine: Testing MASQ functionality without DNS
   
    Now try TELNETing to a remote IP address (i.e. telnet 152.2.210.81 ( this
    is technically the DNS name "metalab.unc.edu"). It might take a few
    seconds to get a login prompt since this is a VERY busy server. Did you
    get a login prompt like shown below? If so, it means that TCP
    Masquerading is running OK. If not, try TELNETing to some other hosts you
    think will support TELNET like 198.182.196.55 (www.linux.org). If this
    still doesn't work, make sure you are using the simple rc.firewall
    ruleset for this test. An example of this output might look like (hit
    Control-D to exit out of the TELNET):
    --------------------------------                                    
    masq-client# telnet 152.2.210.81                                    
    Trying 152.2.210.81...                                              
    Connected to 152.2.210.81.                                          
    Escape character is '^]'.                                           
                                                                        
                                                                        
    SunOS 5.7                                                           
                                                                        
                                                                        
    ******************** Welcome to MetaLab.unc.edu ******************* 
                                                                        
     To login to MetaLab as a user, connect to login.metalab.unc.edu.   
               This machine does not allow public telnet logins.        
                                                                        
    login: Connection closed by foreign host.                           
    --------------------------------                                    
   

 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.10. Testing MASQ functionality with DNS resolution

 

  * Step Ten: Testing MASQ functionality with DNS resolution
   
    Now try TELNETing to a remote machine by DNS name (i.e. "telnet
    metalab.unc.edu" (IP address 152.2.210.81). If this works, the output
    should look like something below. With this test, this shows that
    UDP-based DNS is working fine.
   
    --------------------------------                                    
    masq-client# telnet MetaLab.unc.edu                                 
    Trying 152.2.210.81...                                              
    Connected to 152.2.210.81.                                          
    Escape character is '^]'.                                           
                                                                        
                                                                        
    SunOS 5.7                                                           
                                                                        
                                                                        
    ******************** Welcome to MetaLab.unc.edu ******************* 
                                                                        
     To login to MetaLab as a user, connect to login.metalab.unc.edu.   
               This machine does not allow public telnet logins.        
                                                                        
    login: Connection closed by foreign host.                           
    --------------------------------                                    
   
    If this did not work, but Step EIGHT did work, make sure that you have
    one or more valid DNS servers configured on each of the MASQ CLIENT
    computer(s) as shown in Chapter 4. Please note that these DNS servers
    will typically be your ISP's DNS servers and NOT your local MASQ server.
    Some people might later choose to setup their OWN DNS servers but this is
    beyond the scope of this HOWTO.
   

 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.11. Testing more MASQ functionality with DNS

 

  * Step Eleven: Testing more MASQ functionality with DNS
   
    As a last test, try browsing some 'INTERNET' WWW sites on one of your 
    MASQ Client machines, and see if you can reach them. For example, access
    the Linux Documentation Project site at [http://www.tldp.org] http://
    www.tldp.org. If you are successful in bringing up that page, you can be
    fairly certain that everything is working FINE! If some WWW or FTP sites
    have problems, where other sites seem to work just fine, see the next
    step for more ideas.
   
    If you see The Linux Documentation Project homepage, then 
    CONGRATULATIONS! It's working! If the WWW site comes up correctly, then
    all other standard network tools such as PING, TELNET, SSH, and with
    their related IP MASQ modules loaded: FTP, Real Audio, IRC DCCs, Quake I/
    II/III, CuSeeme, VDOLive, etc. should work fine too! If FTP, IRC,
    RealAudio, Quake I/II/III, etc. aren't working or are performing poorly,
    verify that their associated Masquerading modules are loaded by running
    "lsmod" and also be sure you are loading the module with any non-default
    server ports. If you don't see your needed module, make sure your /etc/
    rc.d/rc.firewall script is loading them (i.e. remove the # character for
    a given IP MASQ module).
   

 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.12. Any remaining functional, performance, etc. issues...

 

  * Step Twelve: Any remaining functional, performance, etc. issues...
   
    If your system passes all of the above tests, but functionality tests
    like WWW browsing, FTP, and other types of traffic aren't reliable or are
    slow, I recommend that you read the FAQ section of this HOWTO..
    specifically the Section 7.15 FAQ entry. There might be other items in
    the FAQ section that will also help you as they have helped many other
    users in the past.
   

 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 6. Other IP Masquerade Issues and Software Support

6.1. Problems with IP Masquerade

Some TCP/IP application protocols will not currently work with Linux IP
Masquerading because they either assume things about port numbers or encode
TCP/IP addresses and/or port numbers in their data stream. These latter
protocols need specific proxies or IP MASQ modules built into the
masquerading code to make them work.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.2. Incoming services

By default, Linux IP Masquerading cannot handle incoming services at all but
there are a few ways that would allow this.

If you do not require high levels of security, then you can simply forward or
redirect IP ports. There are various ways to perform this, though the most
stable method is to use IPPORTFW. For more information, please see Section
6.7.

If you wish to have some level of authorization on incoming connections, then
you will need to either configure TCP-wrappers or Xinetd to allow only
specific IP addresses to pass. The TIS Firewall Toolkit is a good place to
look for tools and information.

More details on incoming security can be found in the [http://
www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/LINUX/index-linux.html#TrinityOS] TrinityOS
document and at IP Masquerade Resource.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.3. Supported Client Software and Other Setup Notes

"** The Linux Masquerade Application list has a lot of good information
regarding applications that work through Linux IP masquerading. This site was
recently taken over by Steve Grevemeyer, who implemented it with a full
database backend. It's a great resource! "

Generally, any application that uses standard TCP and UDP should work. If you
have any suggestion, hints, etc., please see the [http://ipmasq.webhop.net/]
IP Masquerade Resource for more details.

|#   "eth0" with the name of your EXTERNAL Internet connection (ppp0, ippp0,      |

|#               versions have been fixed) did NOT have the ability to run        |
|#               scripts after a lease-renew.  Because of this, you need to       |
|#               replace it with something like "dhcpcd" or "dhclient".           |
|#                                                                                |

<rc.firewall-2.4-stronger STOP>

To automatically start this stronger firewall ruleset at the proper time,
please see the end of the Section 3.4.2 section for full details. Please make
sure you make the correct "rc.firewall-2.4" to "rc.firewall-2.4-stronger"
substitutions!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.4.2. Stronger IP Firewall (IPCHAINS) rulesets

This section provides a more in-depth guide to using the 2.2.x firewall tool,
IPCHAINS. See above sections for IPFWADM rulesets.

This example is for a firewall/masquerade system behind a PPP link with a
static PPP address (dynamic PPP instructions are included but disabled). The
trusted interface is 192.168.0.1 and the PPP interface IP address has been
changed to protect the guilty :-). I have listed each incoming and outgoing
interface individually to catch IP spoofing as well as stuffed routing and/or
masquerading. A nything not explicitly allowed is FORBIDDEN (well.. rejected
actually). If your IP MASQ box breaks after implementing this rc.firewall
script, be sure that you edit it for your configuration and check your /var/
log/messages or /var/adm/messages SYSLOG file for any firewall errors.

For more comprehensive examples of a strong IP Masqueraded IPFWADM rulesets
for PPP, Cablemodem users, etc., please see [http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/
~dranch/LINUX/index-linux.html#TrinityOS] TrinityOS - Section 10 and [http://
www.greatcircle.com/] GreatCircle's Firewall WWW page

NOTE #1: --- UPDATE YOUR KERNEL --- Linux 2.2.x kernels less than version
2.2.20 contain several different security vulnerabilities (some were MASQ
specific). Kernels less than 2.2.20 have a few local vulnerabilities. Kernel
versions less than 2.2.16 have a TCP root exploit vulnerability and versions
less than 2.2.11 have a IPCHAINS fragmentation bug. Because of these issues,
users running a firewall with strong IPCHAINS rulesets are open to possible
instrusion. Please upgrade your kernel to a fixed version.

NOTE #2: If you get a dynamically assigned TCP/IP address from your ISP (PPP,
ADSL, Cablemodems, etc.), you CANNOT load this strong ruleset upon booting.
You will either need to reload this firewall ruleset EVERY TIME you get a new
IP address or make your /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset more intelligent. To do
this for PPP users, carefully read and un-comment out the proper lines in the
"Dynamic PPP IP fetch" section below. You can also find more details in the
[http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/LINUX/index-linux.html#TrinityOS]
TrinityOS - Section 10 doc for more details on Strong rulesets and Dynamic IP
addresses.

Please also be aware that there are several GUI Firewall creation tools
available as well. Please see Chapter 7for full details.

Lastly, if you are using a STATIC PPP IP address, change the "EXTIF=
"your.static.PPP.address"" line to reflect your address.

<rc.firewall-2.2-stronger STOP>

To automatically start this stronger firewall ruleset at the proper time,
please see the end of the Section 3.4.2 section for full details. Please make
sure you make the correct "rc.firewall-2.2" to "rc.firewall-2.2-stronger"
substitutions!!

With IPCHAINS, you can block traffic to a particular site using the "input",
"output", and/or "forward" rules. Remember that the set of rules are scanned
from top to bottom and "-A" tells IPCHIANS to "append" this new rule to the
existing set of rules. So with this in mind, any specific restrictions need
to come before any global rules. For example:

Using "input" rules:

Probably the fastest and most efficient method to block traffic, but this
method only stops the MASQed machines and NOT the firewall machine itself. Of
course, you might want to allow that combination.

Anyway, to block 204.50.10.13:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|In the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset:                                      |

|# reject and log local interface, local machines going to 204.50.10.13     |
|#                                                                          |

|                                                                           |
|# local interface, local machines, going anywhere is valid                 |
|#                                                                          |
|ipchains -A input -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d 0.0.0.0/0 -l -j ACCEPT              |
|                                                                           |
|                                                                           |
|... end of "input" rules ...                                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Using "output" rules:

This is the slower method to block traffic because the packets must go
through masquerading before they are dropped. Yet, this rule even stops the
firewall machine from accessing the forbidden site.

... start of "output" rules ... # reject and log outgoing to 204.50.10.13 #
ipchains -A output -s $ppp_ip/32 -d 204.50.10.13/32 -l -j REJECT # anything
else outgoing on remote interface is valid # ipchains -A output -s $ppp_ip/32
-d 0.0.0.0/0 -l -j ACCEPT ... end of "output" rules ...

Using "forward" rules:

Probably slower than "input" rules for blocking traffic, this only stops
masqueraded machines (e.g. internal machines). The firewall machine can still
reach forbidden site(s).

... start of "forward" rules ... # Reject and log from local net on PPP
interface to 204.50.10.13. # ipchains -A forward -i ppp0 -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d
204.50.10.13/32 -l -j REJECT # Masquerade from local net on local interface
to anywhere. # ipchains -A forward -i ppp0 -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d 0.0.0.0/0 -j
MASQ ... end of "forward" rules ...

No need for a special rule to allow machines on the 192.168.0.0/24 network to
go to 204.50.11.0. Why? It is already covered by the global MASQ rule.

NOTE: Unlike IPFWADM, IPCHIANS has only one way of coding the interfaces
name. IPCHAINS uses the "-i eth0" option where as IPFWADM had both "-W" for
the interface name and "-V" for the interface's IP address.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.4.3. Stronger IP Firewall (IPFWADM) Rulesets

This section provides a more in-depth guide on using the 2.0.x firewall tool,
IPFWADM. See below for IPCHAINS rulesets

This example is for a firewall/masquerade system behind a PPP link with a
static PPP address (dynamic PPP instructions are included but disabled). The
trusted interface is 192.168.0.1 and the PPP interface IP address has been
changed to protect the guilty :). I have listed each incoming and outgoing
interface individually to catch IP spoofing as well as stuffed routing and/or
masquerading. Anything not explicitly allowed is FORBIDDEN (well.. rejected,
actually). If your IP MASQ box breaks after implementing this rc.firewall
script, be sure that you edit it for your configuration and check your /var/
log/messages or /var/adm/messages SYSLOG file for any firewall errors.

For more comprehensive examples of a strong IP Masqueraded IPFWADM rulesets
for PPP, Cablemodem users, etc., please see [http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/
~dranch/LINUX/index-linux.html#TrinityOS] TrinityOS - Section 10 and [http://
www.greatcircle.com/] GreatCircle's Firewall WWW page

NOTE: If you get a dynamically assigned TCP/IP address from your ISP (PPP,
ADSL, Cablemodems, etc.), you CANNOT load this strong ruleset upon boot. You
will either need to reload this firewall ruleset EVERY TIME you get a new IP
address or make your /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset more intelligent. To do
this for PPP users, carefully read and un-comment out the proper lines in the
"Dynamic PPP IP fetch" section below. You can also find more details on
Strong rulesets and Dynamic IP addresses in the [http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu
/~dranch/LINUX/index-linux.html#TrinityOS] TrinityOS - Section 10 docs.

Please also be aware that there are several GUI Firewall creation tools
available as well. Please see Chapter 7for full details.

Lastly, if you are using a STATIC PPP IP address, change the "ppp_ip=
"your.static.PPP.address"" line to reflect your address.

<rc.firewall-2.0-stronger STOP>

To automatically start this stronger firewall ruleset at the proper time,
please see the end of the Section 3.4.3 section for full details. Please make
sure you make the correct "rc.firewall-2.0" to "rc.firewall-2.0-stronger"
substitutions!!

With IPFWADM, you can block traffic to a particular site using the -I, -O or
-F rules. Remember that the set of rules are scanned top to bottom and "-a"
tells IPFWADM to "append" this new rule to the existing set of rules. So with
this in mind, any specific restrictions need to come before global rules. For
example:

Using -I (input ) rules:

Probably the fastest and most efficient method to block traffic but it only
stops the MASQed machines, and NOT the the firewall machine itself. Of
course, you might want to allow that combination.

Anyway, to block 204.50.10.13:

In the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset: ... start of -I rules ... # reject and
log local interface, local machines going to 204.50.10.13 # /sbin/ipfwadm -I
-a reject -V 192.168.0.1 -S 192.168.0.0/24 -D 204.50.10.13/32 -o # local
interface, local machines, going anywhere is valid # /sbin/ipfwadm -I -a
accept -V 192.168.0.1 -S 192.168.0.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0/0 ... end of -I rules ...

Using -O (output) rules:

This is the slower method to block traffic because the packets go through
masquerading first before they are dropped. Yet, this rule even stops the
firewall machine from accessing the forbidden site.

... start of -O rules ... # reject and log outgoing to 204.50.10.13 # /sbin/
ipfwadm -O -a reject -V $ppp_ip -S $ppp_ip/32 -D 204.50.10.13/32 -o #
anything else outgoing on remote interface is valid # /sbin/ipfwadm -O -a
accept -V $ppp_ip -S $ppp_ip/32 -D 0.0.0.0/0 ... end of -O rules ...

Using -F (forward) rules:

Probably slower than -I (input) rules for blocking traffic, this still only
stops masqueraded machines (e.g. internal machines). The firewall machine can
still reach forbidden site(s).

... start of -F rules ... # Reject and log from local net on PPP interface to
204.50.10.13. # /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a reject -W ppp0 -S 192.168.0.0/24 -D
204.50.10.13/32 -o # Masquerade from local net on local interface to
anywhere. # /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a masquerade -W ppp0 -S 192.168.0.0/24 -D
0.0.0.0/0 ... end of -F rules ...

There is no need for a special rule to allow machines on the 192.168.0.0/24
network to go to 204.50.11.0. Why? It is already covered by the global MASQ
rule.

NOTE: There is more than one way of coding the interfaces in the above rules.
For example instead of "-V 192.168.255.1" you can code "-W eth0", instead of
"-V $ppp_ip" , you can use "-W ppp0". The "-V" method was phased out with the
imgration to IPCHAINS, but for IPFWADM users, its more of a personal choice
and documentation.

6.5. IP Masquerading multiple internal networks

Masquerading more than one internal network is fairly simple. You need to
first make sure that all of your networks are running correctly (both
internal and external). You then need to enable traffic to pass to both the
other internal interfaces and to be MASQed to the Internet.

Next, you need to enable Masquerading on the INTERNAL interfaces. This
example uses a total of THREE interfaces: eth0 is the EXTERNAL connection to
the Internet, eth1 is the 192.168.0.0 network, and eth2 is the 192.168.1.0
network. Both eth1 and eth2 will be MASQed out of interface eth0. In your
rc.firewall ruleset next to the existing MASQ enable line, add the following:

Please note that it is CORRECT to have "eth0" specified multiple times for
the exmples shown above. The reason for this is the Linux kernel needs to
know which interface is used for OUTGOING traffic. Since eth0 in the above
examples is the Internet connection, it is listed for each internal
interface.

6.6. IP Masquerade and Dial-on-Demand Connections

 

 1. If you would like to setup your network to automatically dial up the
    Internet, either the Diald demand dial-up or new versions of the PPPd
    packages will be of great utility. Both Diald and PPPd are very powerful
    in their configuration flexibility.
   
 2. To setup PPPd for Dial-on-Demand, pease check out the [http://
    www.samba.org/ppp/index.html] PPPd Homepage
   
 3. To setup Diald, please check out the [http://diald.sourceforge.net/]
    Diald Homepage or [http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/LINUX/
    index-linux.html#TrinityOS] TrinityOS - Section 23
   
 4. Once Dial on Demand and IP Masq have been setup properly, any MASQed
    client machines that initiate a web, telnet or ftp session will make the
    Linux box dynamically bring up its Internet link.
   
 5. There is a timeout that will occur with the first connection. This is
    inevitable if you are using analog modems. The time taken to establish
    the modem link and the PPP connections may cause your client program (WWW
    browser, etc.) to stop. This isn't common though. If this does happen,
    just retry that Internet traffic request (say a WWW page) again and it
    should come up fine. You can also try setting echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/
    ipv4/ip_dynaddr kernel option to help with this initial setup.
   

 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.7. IPPORTFW, IPMASQADM, IPAUTOFW, REDIR, UDPRED, and other Port Forwarding
tools

IPPORTFW, IPAUTOFW, REDIR, UDPRED, and other programs are generic TCP and/or
UDP port forwarding tools for Linux IP Masquerade (for < 2.4 kernels). These
tools are typically used with or as a replacement for specific IP MASQ
modules to get a specific network traffic through the MASQ server.

With port forwarders, you can redirect data connections from the Internet to
an internal, privately addressed machine behind your IP MASQ server. This
forwarding ability includes network protocols such as TELNET, WWW, SMTP, FTP
(with a special patch - see below), ICQ, and many others.

NOTE: If you are just looking to do simple port forwarding but you don't need
Masquerading support, you don't have any choice. You will STILL NEED to
enable IP Masquerading support in the kernel AND either run a IPTABLES,
IPCHAINS, or IPFWADM ruleset to be able to use Linux's port forwarding tools.

So why all the different choices? MARK (MFW), IPMASQADM (PORTFW or AUTOFW),
IPPORTFW, IPAUTOFW, REDIR, and UDPRED (all URLs are in Section 3.2.3) were
the various tools available to IP MASQ users to allow this type of
functionality. Later, as the Linux IP Masquerade feature matured, many of
these tools were eventually replaced by the PORTFW and MARK systems which are
more intelligent solutions.

In recent 2.2.x kernels, the IPMASQADM tool combined the IPAUTOFW and
IPPORTFW 2.0.x kernel tools into one binary. Both the IPMASQADM tool and
IPTABLES also supports a new mechanism called "MARK" or MFW. The MARK system
works where a specific IPTABLES or IPCHAINS ruleset would match a given
packet sequence. Once matched, the tool would "mark" these packets. Later,
the IPMASQADM tool or a specific IPTABLE "table" could be instructed to
change these packets as needed and forward them off to their desired
destination. Currently, this HOWTO doesn't cover the MARK solution but it
will in the near future.

Anyway, because of the availablity of the newer tools, it is *HIGHLY
DISCOURAGED* to use the old tools such as IPAUTOFW (even AUTOFW in IPMASQADM)
and REDIR because they don't properly notify the Linux kernel of their
presence and can ultimately CRASH your Linux server with extreme use.

NOTE #2: With enabling PORTFW functionality in ANY 2.2/2.0 Linux kernel (not
2.4.x), internal machines typically CANNOT use the same "external" PORTFWed
IP address to access a given internal" machine. To put it another way, PORTFW
was only intended to be used with "external" computers on the Internet. If
this is an issue for you, you can also implement the REDIR tool for 2.2.x and
2.0.x kernels to let internal machines get redirected to the internal servers
too. The 2.4.x kernels running IPTABLES solves this issue once and for all
and is covered in a FAQ entry in Section 7.19. If you would like a technical
explination on why this internal/external forwarding doesn't work, please
page down towards the bottom of the 2.2.x PORTFW section for a note from Juan
Jose Ciarlante.

NOTE #3: The forwarding of FTP server traffic to an internal MASQed FTP
server, known as PORTFW FTP, is now fully supported in the 2.4.x kernels as
well as in the 2.2.x kernels via a BETA version FTP kernel module (does NOT
come with the stock Linus kernels). It should also be noted that you can also
PORTFW FTP traffic using an external FTP proxy program (not covered in this
HOWTO). It should be noted that the Beta 2.2.x FTP kernel module code is
still experimental and some people get better results simply using ACTIVE FTP
sessions compared to PASSIVE connections. Interestingly enough, other people
have seen the exact opposite behavior. Please let us know what your results
are like. More about this is covered below in both the 2.2.x and 2.0.x
sections as the solutions require the use of different patches.

WARNING! Before jumping right into installing ANY of these tools, it needs to
be mentioned that network security can be an issue with ANY PORT FORWARD
tool. The reason for this is because these tools basically create a hole in
strong packet firewalls for the required TCP/UDP ports. Though this doesn't
pose any threat to your Linux machine, it might be an issue to the PORTFW'ed
internal machine(s). No worries though, this is what Steven Clarke (the
author of IPPORTFW) had to say about that:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   "Port Forwarding is only called within masquerading functions so it           |
|   fits inside the same IPFWADM/IPCHAINS rules. Masquerading is an extension to  |
|   IP forwarding. Therefore, ipportfw only sees a packet if it fits              |
|   both the input and masquerading ipfwadm rule sets."                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

What that means in English is that if you have a strong packet firewall
running, PORTFW doesn't directly bypass any of that security. You will still
be able to allow or deny specific IPs and/or domains to this new PORTFW'ed
resource if you so wish.

With this said, it's important to have a strong firewall ruleset. Please see 
Section 6.4.1, Section 6.4.2, and Section 6.4.3 for more details on getting
strong rulesets.

  * 2.4.x kernels users should be ready to go for PORTFW functionality. 2.2.x
    and 2.0.x kernel kernel users will need to re-compile the Linux kernel to
    support PORTFW. It should be noted that some Linux distribution kernels
    might have this already done for you.
   
  * Modern 2.2.x kernel users will already have the PORTFW kernel option
    available to them via the normal kernel "make" procedures.
   
  * 2.0.x users will need to apply a simple kernel option patch to have
    access to then enable this via the normal kernel "make" procedures.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.7.1. 2.4.x PORTFWD'ing: Using IPTABLE's PREROUTING option for 2.4.x kernels

Unlike ALL previous Linux kernels, the 2.4.x series now allows for full
PORTFW, PORTFW FTP, and PORTFW REDIR functionality within the "iptables" tool
itself.

NOTE: Once you enable a port forwarder on say port 80 (forward WWW traffic
through the MASQ server to an internal WWW server), that port will no longer
be used by the Linux IP Masquerade server itself. To be more specific, if you
have a WWW server already running on the MASQ server, enabling PORTFW will
now give all Internet users acces to the WWW pages from the -INTERNAL- WWW
server and not the pages on your IP MASQ server.

To enable port forwarding on a 2.4.x kernel:

  * Edit the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall-2.4 ruleset and place the lines shown
    below just ABOVE the "FWD: Allow all connections OUT and only existing
    and related ones IN" line (in the "Optional FORWARD section"). Please be
    sure to replace the word "$EXTIP" with your specific Internet IP address.
   
  * NOTE: Unlike the 2.2.x and 2.0.x kernels, PORTFWed traffic does *not*
    traverse the INPUT or OUTPUT rules. It only traverses the FORWARD rule.
   

  * NOTE: If you use get a DYNAMIC TCP/IP address from your ISP (PPP, ADSL,
    Cablemodems, etc.), you will NEED to make your /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall
    ruleset more intelligent. To do this, please see Section 6.4.2 from above
    or [http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/LINUX/index-linux.html#
    TrinityOS] TrinityOS - Section 10 for more details on strong rulesets and
    Dynamic IP addresses. I'll give you a hint though: /etc/ppp/ip-up for PPP
    users.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 

That's it! Just re-run your /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall-2.4 ruleset and test it
out!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running the rc.firewall-2.4-stronger ruleset? Good for you! To get PORTFW
running with this ruleset, it's very easy. The following example is for HTTP
(WWW) traffic to be PORTFWed to the IP address indicated by the $PORTFWIP
variable:

  * Take the ruleset lines shown above (for the generic rc.firewall ruleset)
    and place them just after the "#FORWARD Enable Forwarding and thus
    IPMASQ" comment lines. It should also be noted that you DO NOT have to
    enable the "HTTPD" rules under the "Optional 'INPUT' section" for
    2.4-based kernels. With 2.4 kernels, those lines are ONLY used if you
    want to allow HTTP traffic to terminate on the MASQ server's httpd
    process (Apache).
   

PORTFW FTP: If you have the "ip_conntrack_ftp" and "ip_nat_ftp" kernel
modules loaded into kernel space (as already done in the rc.firewall-2.4
script), the simple PREROUTING command like the one shown above changed for
for port "21" should do the trick. This is much easier than the configuration
for the old 2.2.x / 2.0.x kernels!

Please note, if you setup PORTFW to an internal FTP server that is running on
a NON-standard FTP port, say port 8021, you MUST tell the "ip_conntrack_ftp"
module about the new FTP port. The reason for this is that FTP is not a
NAT-friendly protocol. By telling the NAT module about this new non-standard
FTP port, the NAT module and do it's job again. To do this, edit your
rc.firewall file and change the loading of the FTP module to look something
like this:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|/sbin/insmod ip_conntrack_ftp ports=21,8021                                |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

PORTFW Redirection of Internal requests: 

In the past, if users PORTFWed port 80 on their EXTERNAL IP address to some
internal machine, only machines out on the Internet would properly reach this
internal WWW server. If you tried to contact this internal WWW server via the
MASQ server's EXTERNAL address, it would fail. Fortunately, there is a
workaround for 2.2.x and 2.0.x kernels using the REDIR tool. Even better, the
use of the REDIR tool is NOT required for the 2.4.x kernels. To support
redirection like this from an internal host, add a rule like the one shown
below ABOVE the "Catch all" FORWARDing rule in the rc.firewall file. The
following example will REDIRECT internal WWW traffic to the 192.168.0.2
internal machine (please change the IP address to reflect your
configuration):

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|$IPTABLES -t nat -A PREROUTING -d $EXTIP -p tcp --dport 80 \               |
| -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j DNAT --to 192.168.0.2         |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.7.2. 2.2.x PORTFWD'ing: Using IPMASQADM with 2.2.x kernels

First, make sure you have the newest 2.2.x kernel uncompressed into /usr/src/
kernel/linux. If you haven't already done this, please see Section 3.2.2
section for full details. Next, download the "ipmasqadm.c" program from 
Section 2.7 into the /usr/src/kernel directory.

Next, you'll need to compile the 2.2.x kernel as shown in Section 3.2.2
section. Be sure to say "YES" to the IPPORTFW option when you configure the
kernel. Once the kernel compile is complete and you have rebooted, return to
this section.

Now, compile and install the IPMASQADM tool:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|        cd /usr/src                                                        |
|        tar xzvf ipmasqadm-x.tgz                                           |
|        cd ipmasqadm-x                                                     |
|        make                                                               |
|        make install                                                       |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Now, for this example, we are going to allow ALL WWW Internet traffic (port
80) hitting your Internet TCP/IP address to be forwarded to the internal
Masqueraded machine at IP address 192.168.0.10.

PORTFW FTP: As mentioned above, there are two solutions for forwarding FTP
server traffic to an internal MASQed PC. The first solution *IS* a BETA level
IP_MASQ_FTP module for 2.2.x kernels to PORT Forward FTP connections to an
internal MASQed FTP server. The other method is using a FTP proxy program
(the URL is in Section 2.7. It should also be noted that the FTP kernel
module also supports the adding of additional PORTFW FTP ports on the fly
without the requirement of unloading and reloading the IP_MASQ_FTP module and
thus breaking any existing FTP transfers. You can find more about this new
code at the IPMASQ WWW site at [http://ipmasq.webhop.net] http://
ipmasq.webhop.net;. There are also examples and some additional information
about PORTFWed FTP connection below in the 2.0.x. kernel section.

NOTE: Once you enable a port forwarder on port 80, that port can no longer be
used by the Linux IP Masquerade server. To be more specific, if you have a
WWW server already running on the MASQ server, a port forward will now give
all Internet users the WWW pages from the -INTERNAL- WWW server and not the
pages on your IP MASQ server.

Anyway, to enable port forwarding for HTTPd:

  * Edit the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset and ENABLE the "Optional" "HTTP"
    sections in both the INPUT and OUTPUT subsections.
   
  * Add the following lines shown below JUST BELOW the "ipchains -P forward
    DENY" rule (in the "Optional FORWARD section"). Be sure to replace the
    "$EXTIP" variable's contents with your EXTERNAL Internet IP address on
    the IPMASQ server.
   

NOTE: If you use get a DYNAMIC TCP/IP address from your ISP (PPP, ADSL,
Cablemodems, etc.), you will NEED to make your /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset
more intelligent. To do this, please see Section 6.4.2 from above or [http://
www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/LINUX/index-linux.html#TrinityOS] TrinityOS -
Section 10 for more details on strong rulesets and Dynamic IP addresses. I'll
give you a hint though: /etc/ppp/ip-up for PPP users.

|#   This will forward ALL port 80 traffic from the external IP address     |

|/usr/sbin/ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L $EXTIP 80 -R $PORTFWIP 80          |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 

That's it! Just re-run your /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset and test it out!

If you get the error message "ipchains: setsockopt failed: Protocol not
available", you AREN'T running your new IPPORTFW enabled kernel. Make sure
that you moved the new kernel over, re-run LILO, and then reboot again. If
you are sure you are running your new kernel, run the command "ls /proc/net/
ip_masq" and make sure the "portfw" file exists. If it doesn't, you must have
made an error when configuring your kernel. Try again.

For those who want to understand why PORTFW cannot redirect traffic for both
external and internal interfaces (the REDIR situation), here is an email from
Juanjo that better explains it:

Actually not.                                                                  
                                                                               
I usually setup a ipmasqadm rule for outside, *AND* a port                     
redirector for inside. This works because ipmasqadm hooks before               
redir will get the eventual outside connection, _but_ leaves things            
ok if not (stated by APPROPIATE rules).                                        
                                                                               
The actual "conceptual" problem comes from the TRUE client (peer) IP           
goal (thanks to masq) being in the same net as target server.                  
                                                                               
The failing scenario for "local masq" is :                                     
   client: 192.168.2.100                                                       
   masq:   192.168.2.1                                                         
   serv:   192.168.2.10                                                        
                                                                               
1)client->server packet                                                        
 a) client:  192.168.2.100:1025  -> 192.168.2.1:80   [SYN]                     
 b) (masq):  192.168.2.100:1025  -> 192.168.2.10:80  [SYN]                     
            (and keep  192.168.2.1:61000 192.168.2.100:1025 related)           
 c) serv:    gets masqed packet (1b)                                           
                                                                               
2)server->client packet                                                        
 a) serv:    192.168.2.10:80     -> 192.168.2.100:1025  [SYN,ACK]              
 b) client:  192.168.2.100:1025  -> 192.168.2.10:80     [RST]                  
                                                                               
Now take a moment to compare (1a) with (2a).                                   
You see, the server replied DIRECTLY to client bypassing masq (not             
letting masq to UNDO the packet hacking) because it is in SAME net, so         
the client resets the connection.                                              
                                                                               
hope I helped.

6.7.3. 2.0.x PORTFWD'ing: Using IPPORTFW on 2.0.x kernels

First, make sure you have the newest 2.0.x kernel uncompressed into /usr/src/
kernel. If you haven't already done this, please see Section 3.2.3 for full
details. Next, download the "ipportfw.c" program and the "subs-patch-x.gz"
kernel patch from Section 3.2.3 into the /usr/src/ directory.

NOTE: Please replace the "x" in the "subs-patch-x.gz" file name with the most
current version available on the site.

Next, if you plan on port forwarding FTP traffic to an internal server, you
will have to apply an additional NEW IP_MASQ_FTP module patch found in 
Section 3.2.3. More details regarding this are later in this section. Please
note that this is NOT the same patch as for the 2.2.x kernels so some
functionality such as the dynamic FTP PORT functionality is not present.

Now, copy the IPPORTFW patch (subs-patch-x.gz) into the Linux directory
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|        cp /usr/src/subs-patch-1.37.gz /usr/src/linux                      |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Next, apply the kernel patch to create the IPPORTFW kernel option:
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|        cd /usr/src/linux                                                  |
|        zcat subs-patch-1.3x.gz | patch -p1                                |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Ok, time to compile the kernel as shown in Section 3.2.3. Be sure to say YES
to the IPPORTFW option now available when you configure the kernel. Once the
compile is complete and you have rebooted, return to this section.

Now with a newly compiled kernel, please compile and install the actual
"IPPORTFW" program
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|        cd /usr/src                                                        |
|        gcc ipportfw.c -o ipportfw                                         |
|        mv ipportfw /usr/local/sbin                                        |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Now, for this example, we are going to allow ALL WWW Internet traffic (port
80) hitting your Internet TCP/IP address to then be forwarded to the internal
Masqueraded machine at IP address 192.168.0.10.

NOTE: Once you enable a port forwarder on port 80, that port can no longer be
used by the Linux IP Masquerade server. To be more specific, if you have a
WWW server already running on the MASQ server and then you port forward port
80 to an internal MASQed computer, ALL internet users will see the WWW pages
pages from the -INTERNAL- WWW server and not the pages on your IP MASQ
server. This only performs a port forward to some other port, say 8080, to
your internal MASQ machine. Though this will work, all Internet users will
have to append :8080 to the URL to then contact the internal MASQed WWW
server.

Anyway, to enable port forwarding, edit the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset.
Add the follow lines but be sure to replace the word "$extip" with your
Internet IP address.

NOTE: If you use get a DYNAMIC TCP/IP address from your ISP (PPP, ADSL,
Cablemodems, etc.), you will NEED to make your /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset
more intelligent. To do this, please see Section 6.4.2from above or [http://
www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/LINUX/index-linux.html#TrinityOS] TrinityOS -
Section 10 for more details on strong rulesets and Dynamic IP addresses. I'll
give you a hint though: /etc/ppp/ip-up for PPP users.

/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|#echo "Enabling IPPORTFW Redirection on the external LAN.."                |
|#                                                                          |
|#   This will forward ALL port 80 traffic from the external IP address     |
|#   to port 80 on the 192.168.0.10 machine                                 |
|#                                                                          |
|/usr/local/sbin/ipportfw -C                                                |
|/usr/local/sbin/ipportfw -A -t$extip/80 -R 192.168.0.10/80                 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

That's it! Just re-run your /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset and test it out!

If you get the error message "ipfwadm: setsockopt failed: Protocol not
available", you AREN'T running your new kernel. Make sure that you moved the
new kernel over, re-run LILO, and then reboot again.

Port Forwarding FTP servers:

If you plan on port forwarding FTP to an internal machine, things get more
complicated. The reason for this is because the standard IP_MASQ_FTP kernel
module wasn't written for this though some users report that it works without
any problems. Personally, without the patch, I've heard that extended file
transfers in excess of 30 minutes will fail without the patch while other
users swear that it works flawlessly. Anyway, I recommend that you try the
following PORTFW instruction with the STOCK ip_masq_ftp module and see if it
works for you. If it doesn't, try using the modified ip_masq_ftp module.

For those who need the module, Fred Viles wrote a modified IP_MASQ_FTP module
to make things work. If you are curious what EXACTLY are the issues, download
the following archive since Fred documents it quite well. Also understand
that this patch is somewhat experimental and should be treated as such. It
should be noted that this patch is ONLY available for the 2.0.x kernels
though there is a different patch available for 2.2.x kernels.

So, to get the 2.0.x patch working, you need to:

 

  * FIRST, apply the IPPORTFW kernel patch as shown earlier in this section.
   
  * Download the "msqsrv-patch-36" from Fred Viles's FTP server in Section
    3.2.3and put it into /usr/src/linux.
   
  * Patch the kernel with this new code by running "cat msqsrv-patch-36 |
    patch -p1"
   
  * Next, replace the original "ip_masq_ftp.c" kernel module with the new one
   
    mv /usr/src/linux/net/ipv4/ip_masq_ftp.c /usr/src/linux/net/ipv4/
    ip_masq_ftp.c.orig
   
    mv /usr/src/linux/ip_masq_ftp.c /usr/src/linux/net/ipv4/ip_masq_ftp.c
   
  * Lastly, build and install the kernel with this new code in place.
   

 

Once this is complete, edit the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset and add the
following lines, but be sure to replace the word "$extip" with your Internet
IP address.

This example, like the one above, will allow ALL FTP Internet traffic (port
21) hitting your Internet TCP/IP address to then be forwarded to the internal
Masqueraded machine at IP address 192.168.0.10.

NOTE: Once you enable a port forwarder on port 21, that port can no longer be
used by the Linux IP Masquerade server. To be more specific, if you have an
FTP server already running on the MASQ server, a port forward will now give
all Internet users the FTP files from the -INTERNAL- FTP server and not the
files on your IP MASQ server.

6.8. CU-SeeMe and Linux IP-Masquerade

Linux IP Masquerade supports CuSeeme via the "ip_masq_cuseeme" kernel module.
This kernel modules should be loaded in the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall script.
Once the "ip_masq_cuseeme" module is installed, you should be able to both
initiate and receive CuSeeme connections to remote reflectors and/or users.

NOTE: It is recommended to use the IPPORTFW tool instead of the old IPAUTOFW
tool for running CuSeeme.

If you need more explicit information on configuring CuSeeme, see Michael
Owings's CuSeeMe page for a Mini-HOWTO or The IP Masquerade Resources for a
mirror of the Mini-HOWTO.

6.9. Mirabilis ICQ

ICQ, the instant messaging client now owned by AOL, has changed over the
years. All modern ICQ clients are NAT friendly and thus DON'T require any
special NAT modules, PORTFW tricks, etc.

IF, for some reason, you want to run an OLD ICQ client, you can read this
section. If not, just IGNORE all this info. I am leaving this in the HOWTO
demonstrate large a LARGE PORTFW example.

There are three methods of getting ICQ to work behind a Linux MASQ server.
These solutions include the use the ICQ Masq module (for 2.2.x and 2.0.x
kernels), using IPPORTFW for basic ICQ functionality, or setting up a SOCKS
proxy server.

MODULE: The ICQ module was written for the older generation of ICQ clients
for both the 2.2.x and 2.0.x kernels. This module allows for the simple setup
of multiple ICQ users behind a MASQ server. It also doesn't require any
special changes to the ICQ client(s). Recently, AOL changed the protocol and
ports used for ICQ. Because of this, many users might find that the
ip_masq_icq module will no longer help them. For users of the older ICQ
clients, the 2.2.x version of the module supports file transfer and read-time
chat. The 2.0.x kernel module doesn't support file transfers and there is no
module available for the 2.4.x kernels.

PORTFW: Your next option is to use port forwarding. With port forwarding,
basic ICQ chat will work but file transfers might not be very reliable.
Please see below for an example of how to configure ICQ PORTFW.

SOCKS: Finally, your last and possibly best option is to setup a SOCKS proxy
server on your Linux machine. This service can happily co-exist with the MASQ
service and ICQ should be fully functional regardless of what Linux kernel
version you are running. The use of a SOCKS server will require ALL ICQ
clients to be reconfigured to use it and the installation and configuration
of a SOCKS server has nothing to do with IP Masquerade. Because of this,
SOCKS is not covered in this HOWTO.

If you are interested in Andrew Deryabin's [mailto:djsf@usa.net] djsf@usa.net
ICQ IP Masq module for the 2.2.x and 2.0.x kernels, please see Section 2.7
for details.

To use port forwarding (PORFW)for ICQ, you will have to make some changes on
both Linux and ICQ clients but all ICQ messaging, URLs, chat, and some file
transfers should work.

  * First, you need to be running a Linux kernel with IPPPORTFW enabled.
    Please see Section 6.7for more details.
   
  * Next, you need to add the following lines to your /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall
    file. This example assumes that 10.1.2.3 is your external Internet IP
    address and your internal MASQed ICQ machine is 192.168.0.10:
   
  * The following example is for a 2.2.x kernel with IPCHAINS:
   
    I have included two examples here for the user: Either one would work
    fine:

    Example #2
    port=2000                                                             
    while [ $port -le 2020 ]                                              
      do                                                                  
        /usr/local/sbin/ipportfw -A t10.1.2.3/$port -R 192.168.0.10/$port 
        port=$((port+1))                                                  
    done                                                                  
                                                                          
   
  * Once your new rc.firewall is ready, reload the ruleset to make sure
    things are OK by simply typing in "/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall". If you get any
    errors, you either don't have IPPORTFW support in the kernel or you made
    a typo in the rc.firewall file.
   
  * Now, in ICQ's Preferences-->Connection, configure it to be "Behind a LAN"
    and "Behind a firewall or Proxy". Now, click on "Firewall Settings" and
    configure it to be "I don't use a SOCK5 proxy". Also note that it was
    previously recommended to change ICQ's "Firewall session timeouts" to
    "30" seconds BUT many users have found that ICQ becomes unreliable. It
    has been found that ICQ is more reliable with its stock timeout setting
    (don't enable that ICQ option) and simply change MASQ's timeout to 160
    seconds. You can see how to change this timeout in Section 3.4.3 and 
    Section 3.4.2 rulesets. Finally, click on Next and configure ICQ to "Use
    the following TCP listen ports.." from "2000" to "2020". Now click done.
   
    Now ICQ will tell you that you will have to restart ICQ for the changes
    to take effect. To be honest, I had to REBOOT the Windows9x machine in
    order for things to work right but some users might say otherwise. So..
    try it both ways.
   
  * A user once told me that by simply portforwarding port 4000 to his ICQ
    machine, it worked perfectly. He reported that EVERYTHING worked fine
    (even chat, file transfers, etc) WITHOUT re-configuring ICQ from its
    default settings. Your mileage might vary on this topic but I thought you
    might like to hear about this alternative configuration.

6.10. Gamers: The LooseUDP patch

The LooseUDP patch allows semi-NAT-friendly games that usually use UDP
connections to both WORK behind a Linux IP Masquerade server.

What the LooseUDP patch does is allow ALL UDP packets to be NATed through the
MASQ box without any checks or expiration. This liberal forwarding method is
considered insecure by many and is disabled in modern 2.2.x kernels. The
2.4.x kernels with it's IPTABLES stateful UDP inspection only allows incoming
UDP packets into the machine (and thus MASQ) if there was already an outbound
UDP packet to that same host in it's stateful table. If the MASQ host hasn't
sent a UDP packet to the remote host within ~30 seconds, the return UDP table
entry is deleted. Because of this, IPTABLES removes most of the need for the
LooseUDP patch as it does it in a more secure fashion.

Currently, LooseUDP is available as a patch for 2.0.36+ kernels and it is
already built into 2.2.3+ kernels though it is now DISABLED by DEFAULT in
2.2.16+ (please see the example rc.firewal ruleset comments for details).

To get LooseUDP running on a 2.0.x kernel, follow the following steps:

  * Have the newest 2.0.x kernel sources uncompressed in the /usr/src/linux
    directory
   
  * ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED for v2.0.x: Download and install the IPPORTFW patch
    from Section 3.2.3and as described in Section 6.7of the HOWTO.
   
  * Download the LooseUDP patch from Section 3.2.3
   
    Now, put the LooseUDP patch in the /usr/src/linux directory. Once this is
    done, type in:
   
    +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |For a compressed patch file:  zcat loose-udp-2.0.36.patch.gz | patch -p1|
    +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   
    +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |For a NON-compressed patch file:  cat loose-udp-2.0.36.patch | patch -p1|
    +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   
    Now, depending on the version of your "patch", You will then see the
    following text:
   
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |patching file `CREDITS'                                        |
    |patching file `Documentation/Configure.help'                   |
    |patching file `include/net/ip_masq.h'                          |
    |patching file `net/ipv4/Config.in'                             |
    |patching file `net/ipv4/ip_masq.c'                             |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   
  * If you see the text "Hunk FAILED" only ONCE and ONLY ONCE at the very
    beginning of the patching, don't be alarmed. You probably have an old
    patch file (this has been fixed) but it still works. If it fails
    completely, make sure you have applied the IPPORTFW kernel patch FIRST.
   
    Once the patch is installed, re-configure the kernel as shown in Section
    3.2.3 and be sure to say "Y" to the "IP: loose UDP port managing
    (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_IP_MASQ_LOOSE_UDP) [Y/n/?]" option.
   

 

To get LooseUDP running on a 2.2.x kernel, follow the following steps:

  * In the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall script, goto the BOTTOM of the file and find
    the LooseUDP section. Change the "0" in the line: echo "0" > /proc/sys/
    net/ipv4/ip_masq_udp_dloose to a "1" and re-run the rc.firewall ruleset.
    An example of this is given in both Section 3.4.2 example and Section
    6.4.3 example.
   

 

NOTE: The LooseUDP code is /not/ available (?required?) for the 2.4.x kernels

  * See the begining of this section for all the details. Basically, the old
    2.0.x / 2.2.x LooseUDP code was considered a security issue. Because of
    this, it was removed from the kernel. Fortunately, some games that used
    to require the LooseUDP code on the 2.2.x IPCHAINS system might work just
    final under the 2.4.x IPTABLES kernels. If the games don't work, I'm not
    aware of a solution for you. Sorry.
   

Once you are running the new LooseUDP enabled kernel, you should be good to
go for most NAT-friendly games. Some URLs have been given for patches to make
games like BattleZone and others NAT friendly. Please see Section 6.3.1 for
more details.

7.2. ( Requirements ) - What are the minimum hardware requirements and any
limitations for IP Masquerade? How well does it perform?

A 486/66 box with 16MB of RAM was more than sufficient to fill a 1.54Mb/s T1
100%! MASQ has also been known to run quite well on 386SX-16s with 8MB of
RAM. Yet, it should be noted that Linux IP Masquerade starts thrashing the
system with more than 500 MASQ entries.

The only application that I know which can temporarily break Linux IP
Masquerade, is GameSpy. Why? When it refreshes its lists, it creates 10,000s
of quick connections in a VERY short period of time. Until these sessions
timeout, the MASQ tables become "FULL". See Section 7.23 of the FAQ for more
details.

While we are at it:

There is a hard limit of 4096 concurrent connections each for TCP & UDP. This
limit can be changed by fiddling the values in /usr/src/linux/net/ipv4/
ip_masq.h - a maximum limit of 32000 should by OK. If you want to change the
limit - you need to change the PORT_MASQ_BEGIN & PORT_MASQ_END values to get
an appropriately sized range above 32K and below 64K.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.3. ( Errors ) - When I run the rc.firewall command, I get "command not
found" errors. Why?

How did you put the rc.firewall onto your machine? Did you cut&paste it into
a TELNET window, FTP it from a Windows/DOS machine, etc? Try this.. log into
your Linux box and run "vim -b /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall" and see if all your
lines end in a ^M. If they do, delete all the ^M and try again.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.4. ( Still wont work ) - I've checked all my configurations, I still can't
get IP Masquerade to work. What should I do?

 

  * Stay calm. Get yourself a cup of tea, coffee, soda, etc., and have a
    rest. Once your mind is clear, try the suggestions mentioned below.
    Setting up Linux IP Masquerading is NOT hard but there are several
    concepts that will be new to you.
   
  * Again, go through all the steps in Chapter 5. 99% of all first-time
    Masquerade users who have problems haven't looked here.
   
  * Check the IP Masquerade Mailing List Archives, most likely your questions
    or problems are a common one and can be found in a simple Archive search.
   
  * Check out the [http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/LINUX/
    index-linux.html#TrinityOS] TrinityOS document. It covers IP Masquerading
    for both the 2.0.x and 2.2.x kernels and MANY other topics including
    PPPd, DialD, DHCP, DNS, Sendmail, etc.
   
  * Make sure that you aren't running ROUTED or GATED. To verify, run "ps aux
    | grep -e routed -e gated"
   
  * Post your question to the IP Masquerade Mailing List (see next the FAQ
    section for details). Please only use this if you cannot find the answer
    from the IP Masquerading Archive. Be sure to include all the information
    requested in Chapter 5 in your email!!
   
  * Post your question to a related Linux NNTP newsgroup.
   
  * Send email to [mailto:ambrose@writeme.com] ambrose@writeme.com and
    [mailto:dranch@trinnet.net] dranch@trinnet.net. You have a better chance
    of getting a reply from the IP Masquerading Email list than either of us.
   
  * Check your configurations again :-)
   

 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.5. ( Email list ) - How do I join or view the IP Masquerade and/or IP
Masqurade Developers mailing lists and archives?

There are two ways to join the two Linux IP Masquerading mailing lists. The
first way is to send an email to [mailto:masq-request@indyramp.com]

7.6. ( NAT vs. Proxy ) - How does IP Masquerade differ from Proxy or NAT
services?

Proxy:  Proxy servers are available for: Win95, NT, Linux, Solaris, etc.              
                                                                                      
            Pro:    + (1) IP address ; cheap                                          
                    + Optional caching for better performance (WWW, etc.)             
                                                                                      
            Con:    - All applications behind the proxy server must both SUPPORT      
                      proxy services (SOCKS) and be CONFIGURED to use the Proxy       
                      server                                                          
                    - Screws up WWW counters and WWW statistics                       
                                                                                      
         A proxy server uses only (1) public IP address, like IP MASQ, and acts       
         as a translator to clients on the private LAN (WWW browser, etc.).           
         This proxy server receives requests like TELNET, FTP, WWW,                   
         etc. from the private network on one interface.  It would then in turn,      
         initiate these requests as if someone on the local box was making the        
         requests.   Once the remote Internet server sends back the requested         
         information, it would re-translate the TCP/IP addresses back to the          
         internal MASQ client and send traffic to the internal requesting host.       
         This is why it is called a PROXY server.                                     
                                                                                      
                Note:  ANY applications that you might want to use on the             
                        internal machines *MUST* have proxy server support            
                        like Netscape and some of the better TELNET and FTP           
                        clients.  Any clients that don't support proxy servers        
                        won't work.                                                   
                                                                                      
         Another nice thing about proxy servers is that some of them                  
         can also do caching (Squid for WWW).  So, imagine that you have 50           
         proxied hosts all loading Netscape at once.  If they were installed          
         with the default homepage URL, you would have 50 copies of the same          
         Netscape WWW page coming over the WAN link for each respective computer.     
         With a caching proxy server, only one copy would be downloaded by the        
         proxy server and then the proxied machines would get the WWW page from       
         the cache.  Not only does this save bandwidth on the Internet                
         connection, it will be MUCH MUCH faster for the internal proxied             
         machines.                                                                    
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
MASQ:    IP Masq is available on Linux and a few ISDN routers such                    
 or      as the Zytel Prestige128, Cisco 770, NetGear ISDN routers, etc.

                Con:    - Requires a Linux box or special ISDN router                 
                          (though other products might have this..  )                 
                        - Incoming traffic cannot access your internal LAN            
                          unless the internal LAN initiates the traffic or            
                          specific port forwarding software is installed.             
                          Many NAT servers CANNOT provide this functionality.         
                        - Special protocols need to be uniquely handled by            
                          firewall redirectors, etc.  Linux has full support          
                          for this (FTP, IRC, etc.) capabilty but many routers        
                          do NOT (NetGear DOES).                                      
                                                                                      
         Masq or 1:Many NAT is similar to a proxy server in the sense that the        
         server will perform IP address translation and fake out the remote server    
         (WWW for example) as if the MASQ server made the request instead of an       
         internal machine.                                                            
                                                                                      
         The major difference between a MASQ and PROXY server is that MASQ servers    
         don't need any configuration changes to all the client machines.  Just       
         configure them to use the linux box as their default gateway and everything  
         will work fine.  You WILL need to install special Linux modules for things   
         like RealAudio, FTP, etc. to work)!                                          
                                                                                      
         Also, many users operate IP MASQ for TELNET, FTP, etc. *AND* also setup a    
         caching proxy on the same Linux box for WWW traffic for the additional       
         performance.                                                                 
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
NAT:     NAT servers are available on Windows 95/NT, Linux, Solaris, and some         
         of the better ISDN routers (not Ascend)

         Network Address Translation is the name for a box that would have a pool of  
         valid IP addresses on the Internet interface which it can use.  Whenever the 
         Internal network wanted to go to the Internet, it associates an available    
         VALID IP address from the Internet interface to the original requesting      
         PRIVATE IP address.  After that, all traffic is re-written from the NAT      
         public IP address to the NAT private address.  Once the associated PUBLIC    
         NAT address becomes idle for some pre-determined amount of time, the         
         PUBLIC IP address is returned back into the public NAT pool.                 
                                                                                      
         The major problem with NAT is, once all of the free public IP addresses are  
         used, any additional private users requesting Internet service are out of    
         luck until a public NAT address becomes free.

NAT, please see:

old but still valid:

7.7. ( GUI ) - Are there any GUI firewall creation/management tools?

Yes! They vary in the type of user interface, complexity, etc. but they are
quite good though most are only for the IPFWADM tool so far. Here is a short
list of available tools in alphabetical order. If you know of any others or
have any thoughts on which ones are good/bad/ugly, please email David.

    works

    FWCONFIG, this new solution is fully WWW based and offers redundancy
    options, etc for both IPCHAINS and NetFilter.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.8. ( MASQ and Dynamic IPs ) - Does IP Masquerade work with dynamically
assigned IP addresses?

Yes, it works with either dynamic IP addressed assigned by your ISP via
either PPP or a DHCP/BOOTp server. As long as you have a valid Internet IP
address, it should work. Of course, static IP works too. Yet, if you plan on
implementing a strong IPFWADM/IPCHAINS ruleset and/or plan on using a Port
forwarder, your ruleset will have to be re-executed everytime your IP address
changes. Please see the top of [http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/LINUX/
index-linux.html#TrinityOS] TrinityOS - Section 10 for additional help with
strong firewall rulesets and Dynamic IP addresses.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.9. ( MASQ and various networks ) - Can I use a cable modem (both
bi-directional and with modem returns), DSL, satellite link, etc. to connect
to the Internet and use IP Masquerade?

Yes, as long as Linux supports that network interface, it should work. If you
receive a dynamic IP address, please see the URL under the "Does IP
Masquerade work with dynamically assigned IP" FAQ item above.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.10. ( Dial on Demand ) - Can I use Diald or the Dial-on-Demand feature of
PPPd with IP MASQ?

Definitely! IP Masquerading is totally transparent to Diald or PPP. The only
thing that might become an issue is if you use STRONG firewall rulesets with
dynamic IP addresses. See the FAQ item, "Does IP Masquerade work with
dynamically assigned IP addresses?" above for more details.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.11. ( Apps ) - What applications are supported with IP Masquerade?

It is very difficult to keep track of a list of "working applications".
However, most of the normal Internet applications are supported, such as WWW
browsing (Netscape, MSIE, etc.), FTP (such as WS_FTP), TELNET, SSH,
RealAudio, POP3 (incoming email - Pine, Eudora, Outlook), SMTP (outgoing
email), etc. A somewhat more complete list of MASQ-compatible clients can be
found in Section 6.3 in this HOWTO.

Applications involving more complicated protocols or special connection
methods such as video conferencing software need special helper tools.

For more details, please see the [http://www.tsmservices.com/masq/] Linux IP
masquerading Applications page.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.12. ( Distro Setup ) - How can I get IP Masquerade running on Redhat,
Debian, Slackware, etc.?

No matter which Linux distribution you have, the procedures for setting up IP
Masquerade mentioned in this HOWTO should apply. Some distributions may have
GUI or special configuration files that make the setup easier. We tried our
best to write this HOWTO as general as possible.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.13. ( Timeouts ) - Connections seem to break if I don't use them often. Why
is that?

IP Masq, by default, sets its timers for TCP session, TCP FIN, and UDP
traffic to 15 minutes. It is recommend to use the following settings (as
already shown in this HOWTO's /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset) for most users:

Linux 2.4.x with IPTABLES

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

|#                                                                          |

|#                                                                          |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.14. ( Odd Behavior ) - When my Internet connection first comes up, nothing
works. If I try again, everything then works fine. Why is this?

The reason is because you have a dynamic IP address and when your Internet
connection first comes up, IP Masquerade doesn't know its IP address. There
is a solution to this. In your /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset, add the
following:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|# Dynamic IP users:                                                                |
|#                                                                                  |

7.15. ( MTU ) - IP MASQ seems to be working fine but some sites don't work.
This usually happens with WWW and some FTP sites.

Depending on what Linux kernel version you are running on the MASQ server,
some will people disagree on the real problem. The two following arguments
have valid points, are inter-related, and users from each camp continue to
debate this to this day.

  * With modern 2.4.x Linux systems, most users point their finger at the
    adminstrators of these remote broken sites (typically SSL-encrypted WWW
    sites, etc.) or your MASQ server's upstream router run by your ISP. The
    main though it that these machines are either filtering or not properly
    responding to SOME or ALL FORMS of ICMP packets (specifically ICMP Code 3
    Type 4 - Fragmentation Needed) messages due to a fray of misplaced
    security paranoia.
   
    What does that all mean? Basically, say your machine is connected to the
    Internet with a MTU of 1492 bytes (Maximum Transmission Unit -- the
    maximum packet size your computer can transmit) which is common for PPPoE
    users. At the same time, the remote WWW/FTP site is connected to the
    Internet at a MTU of 1500 bytes. The way that TCP/IP works is that when a
    TCP connection is being negotiated for your HTTP / FTP connection, the
    remote side will try to verify that a 1500 byte packet can reach your
    computer via the initial TCP "SYN" packet.
   
    Since the packet is too big for your connection, your upstream router
    (run by your ISP) will send a ICMP 3:4 (fragmentation needed) packet back
    to the remote WWW / FTP server. Within this packet is a recommended
    smaller MTU size to retry with. The problem is that either your local
    upstream router, some router between you and the remote server, or the
    remote HTTP / FTP server is either misconfigured or has a firewall in
    front of it that is BLOCKing these ICMP packets.
   
  * The final UNCOMMON possibility is a debatable 2.0 / 2.2 kernel bug in the
    IPMASQ code. Some users point their finger to the fact that IPMASQ might
    have problems with ICMP packets that have the DF or "Don't Fragment" bit
    set. Basically, when a MASQ box connects to the Internet with an MTU of
    anything less than 1500, some packets will have the DF field set. Though
    changing the MTU of the MASQ server's Internet link to 1500 seemingly
    fixes the problem, the possible bug is still there. What is believed to
    be happening in these older kernels is that the MASQ code is not properly
    re-writing the return IP addresses of the ICMP 3 Sub 4 code packets back
    to the originating MASQed computer. Because of this, these critical
    packets get dropped.
   

No worries though. A there are several perfectly good ways to fix this nasty
MTU problem:

  * Enable PMTU clamping in PPPoE
   
    This solution is mostly for modern 2.4.x and 2.2.x kernel users connected
    to the Internet via a PPPoE DSL or Cablemodem connections. This solution
    allows for changes to be done ONLY on the MASQ server itself and not on
    all of the internal MASQ clients.
   
  * Enable PMTU clamping via IPTABLES
   
    This solution is only modern 2.4.x kernel users connected via ANY type of
    Internet connection. This solution allows for changes to be done ONLY on
    the MASQ server itself and not on all of the internal MASQ clients.
   
  * Change your MASQ server's Internet Link MTU
   
    This solution will work for any Linux kernel version but is is NOT a
    solution if you have a PPPoE connection for DSL/Cablemodem users.
   
    It should be noted that some users will balk at this solution because it
    can hurt some latency specific programs like TELNET and Internet games
    but the impact is only slight. On the other hand, most HTTP and FTP
    traffic will SPEED UP!
   
  * Change the MTU of all internal MASQed machines
   
    This solution requires the most work as you have to make minor changes to
    ALL of the internal IPMASQed machines. Basically, you would be changing
    the MTU on all of the internal machines to match the MTU of your MASQ
    server's Internet connection. Fortunately, this solution is usually
    bulletproof where as some of the other solutions mentioned in this
    section might rarely not work.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.15.1. Enabling PMTU Clamping for PPPoE and some PPP Users:

For those users who use PPPoE clients for (DSL / Cablemodem) or PPP (Dialup),
you're Internet connection is NOT "eth0" (for example) but usually "ppp0". In
addition to this, your Internet link's MTU or Maximum Transmission Unit
(largest packet you can transmit over the Internet) isn't 1500 bytes but
1492. The 1492 byte MTU comes from the link size of Ethernet (1518 bytes) -
Ethernet MAC overhead (18) = 1500. Then you subtract the PPPoE header (8
bytes) == MTU of 1492. This overhead isn't a big deal but sometimes ISPs or
remote Internet sites do stupid things to break PPPoE or non-1500 byte MTU
connected machines.

You can find more info about this topic on the web. Specifically, here is
good presentaion on the topic: mss-talk presentation (PDF). Here is the
entire Write up and other good info

To enable clamping in both the RP or PPPd PPPoE clients, add the following
line to your /etc/ppp/pppoe.conf file:
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  # - If you have a computer acting as a gateway for a LAN, choose "1412".  |
|  #   The setting of 1412 is safe for either setup, but uses slightly more  |
|  #   CPU power.                                                            |
|  #                                                                         |
|  CLAMPMSS=1412                                                             |
|                                                                            |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.15.2. Clamping the MSS via IPTABLES:

As mentioned above for PPPoE users, some ISPs and WWW sites filter critical
ICMP packets like MTU Path Discovery. Because of this, many users might find
mosr Internet sites work but others hang or work poorly. Fortunately, recent
IPTABLES have added PMTU Clamping support which should help you. If your
using IPTABLES and think you're hitting this issue, try adding the following
line to the end of your rc.firewall-2.4 ruleset. It should be noted that
there is no PMTU clamping support in IPCHAINS.
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| iptables -I FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu   |
|                                                                                    |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

If this line causes an error when you re-run the rc.firewall-2.4* firewall
rulesets, you might need to upgrade your version of IPTABLES which includes
the "TCPMSS" IPTABLES module.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.15.3. Changing the External MTU of the MASQ server:

This solution usually only applies to DIALUP users since PPPoE users cannot
INCREASE their MTU because of PPPoE's header overhead.

To use this solution, first see what your current MTU for your Internet link
is. To do so, run "/bin/ifconfig" on the MASQ server. Look at the lines that
corresponds to your Internet connection and look for the MTU (for example,
ppp0). This NEEDs to be set to 1500. Usually, Ethernet links will default to
1500 for Ethernet but serial / DIALUP modem PPP links might default to 576.

  * To change the MTU on a standard Ethernet link to your bridged or routed
    DSL, Cablemodem, etc. connection, you need to edit the correct network
    startup scripts for your Linux distribution. Please see the [http://
    www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/LINUX/index-linux.html#TrinityOS] TrinityOS
    - Section 16 document for network optimizations.
   
  * To change the MTU issue on a PPP (not PPPoE) Internet link, edit your "/
    etc/ppp/options" file and towards the top, add the following text on two
    seperate lines, add:
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |   mtu 1500                                                    |
    |   mru 1500                                                    |
    |                                                               |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   
    Save these new changes and then restart PPP. Like shown above, verify
    that your PPP link has the correct MTU and MTU.
   
    CUA Users: Lastly, though this isn't a common problem, some Linux 2.0.x
    kernel users have found a MTU solution to the following problem. With PPP
    users, verify what port is your PPPd code connecting to. Is it a /dev/cua
    * port or a /dev/ttyS* port? It NEEDS to be a /dev/ttyS* port as the /dev
    /cua* device ststem has been deprecated and it breaks some things in very
    odd ways.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.15.4. Changing the MTU of various operating systems:

If you reconfigure ALL of your MASQed PCs to use the SAME MTU as your
external Internet link's MTU (for example, 1492 for PPPoE users), everything
should work fine and this method is sometimes the MOST EFFECTIVE way of
fixing things. This is including ALL of the solutions mentioned above. But
doing things this way can be a lot of work if there are lots of internal
MASQed machines or be even impossible to do if you don't have administrative
access to all the internal MASQed machines.

Follow these simple steps for your respective operating system:

The follow examples utilize an MTU of 1492 for typical PPPoE connections for
some DSL and Cablemodem users. It is recommended to use the HIGHEST values
possible for all connections that are 128Kb/s and faster. It should be noted
that some PPPoE ISPs might require an MTU setting of 1460 (not 1492) for
proper connectivity due to additional overhead in the ISP's internal network.

The only real reason to use smaller MTUs than 1492 or 1460 is to lower your
Internet link's latency but at the cost of throughput. Please see [http://
www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/PPP/ppp-performance.html#mtu] http://
www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/PPP/ppp-performance.html#mtu for more details
on this topic.

7.15.4.1. Changing the MTU on Linux:

 
------------------------------------------                                     
1. The setting of MTU can vary from Linux distribution to distribution.        
                                                                               
   For Redhat: You need to edit the various "ifconfig" statements in           
               the /sbin/ifup script                                           
                                                                               
   For Slackware: You need to edit the various "ifconfig" statements in        
                  the /etc/rc.d/rc1.inet                                       
                                                                               
2. Here is one good, any-distribution-will-work example, edit the              
   /etc/rc.d/rc.local file and put the following at the END of the file:       
                                                                               
        echo "Changing the MTU of ETH0"                                        
        /sbin/ifconfig eth0 mtu 1492                                           
                                                                               
     Replace "eth0" with the interface name that is the machine's upstream     
     connection which is connected to the Internet.                            
                                                                               
3. For advanced options like "TCP Receive Windows" and such, detailed examples 
   on how to edit the respective networking scripts for your specific Linux    
   distro, etc., please see Chapter 16 of

7.15.4.4. Changing the MTU on MS Windows 98:

 
------------------------------------------                                      
1. Making ANY changes to the Registry is inheritantly risky but                 
   with a backup copy, you should be safe.  Proceed at your OWN RISK.           
                                                                                
2. Goto Start-->Run-->RegEdit                                                   
                                                                                
3. You should make a backup copy of your Registry before doing anything.  To    
   do this, copy the "user.dat" and "system.dat" files from the \WINDOWS        
   directory and put them into a safe place.  It should be noted that the       
   previously mentioned method of using "Regedit: Registry-->Export Registry    
   File-->Save a copy of your registry" would only perform Registry MERGES      
   and NOT do a replacement.                                                    
                                                                                
4. Search though each of the Registry trees that end in "n" (e.g. 0007)         
   and have a Registry entry called "IPAddress" which has the IP address        
   of your NIC.  Under that key, add the following:

5. You can also change the "TCP Receive Window" which sometimes                 
   increases network performance SUBSTANTIALLY.  If you notice your             
   throughput has DECREASED, put these items BACK to their original             
   settings and reboot.

7.16. ( FTP ) - MASQed FTP clients don't work.

Check to see that the "ip_masq_ftp" module is loaded. To do this, log into
the MASQ server and run the command "/sbin/lsmod". If you don't see the
"ip_masq_ftp" module loaded, make sure that you followed the BASIC /etc/rc.d/
rc.firewall recommendations found in Section 3.4. If you are implementing
your own ruleset, make sure you include most of the examples from the HOWTO
or you will have many susequent problems.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.17. ( Performance ) - IP Masquerading seems slow

There might be a few reasons for this:

  * You might be unrealistic about how much available bandwidth is on your
    modem line. Lets do the math for a typical 56k modem connection:
   
     1. 56k modems = 56,000 bits per second.
       
     2. You really DON'T have a 56k modem but a 52k modem per US FCC
        limitations.
       
     3. You'll almost NEVER get 52k, the best connection I used to get was
         48k
       
     4. 48,000 bits per second is 4,800 BYTES per second (8 bits to a byte +
        2 bits for the START and STOP RS-232 serial bits)
       
     5. With an MTU of 1500, you will get (3.2) packets in one second. Since
        this will involve fragmentation, you need to round DOWN to (3)
        packets per second.
       
     6. Again with MTU of 1500, thats 3.2 x 40 bytes of TCP/IP overhead (8%)
       
     7. So the BEST throughput you could hope for is 4.68KB/s w/o
        compression. Compression, be it v.42bis hardware compression, MNP5,
        or MS/Stac compression can yeild impressive numbers on highly
        compressable stuff like TEXT files, but acutally slow things down
        when transfering pre-compressed files like ZIPs, MP3s, etc.
       
   

Ethernet attached setups (DSL, Cablemodem, LANs, etc)

  * Make sure you don't have both your INTERNAL and EXTERNAL networks running
    on the same network card with the "IP Alias" feature. If you ARE doing
    this, it can be made to work but it will be excessively slow due to high
    levels of collisions, IRQ usage, etc. It is highly recommended that you
    install another network card for the internal and external networks to
    have their own interface.
   
  * Make sure you have the right Ethernet settings for both SPEED and DUPLEX.
   
  * Some 10Mb/s Ethernet cards and most 100Mb/s cards support FULL Duplex
    connections. Direct connections from an Ethernet card to, say, a DSL
    modem (without any hubs in between) *CAN* be set to FULL DUPLEX but only
    if the DSL modem supports it. You should also be sure that you have
    Ethernet cables with all eight wires used and that they are in good
    condition.
   
    Internal networks that use HUBs -cannot- use Full Duplex. You need either
    a 10 or 100Mb.s Ethernet SWITCH to be able to do this.
   
    Both auto 10/100Mb/s SPEED negotiation and Full/Half DUPLEX negotiation
    on Ethernet cards can wreck havoc on networks. I recommend to hard code
    both the NIC speed and duplex into the NIC(s) if possible. This is
    directly possible via Linux NIC kernel modules but isn't directly
    possible in monolithic kernels. You will need to either use MII utililies
    from Section 8.1 or hardcode the kernel source.
   

Optimize your MTU and set the TCP Sliding window to at least 8192

  * Though this is COMPLETELY out of the scope of this document, this helps
    QUITE A BIT with ANY network link you have, be it an internal or external
    PPP, Ethernet, TokenRing, etc. link. For more details, this topic is
    briefly touched in an above section in Section 7.15. For even more
    details, check out the Network Optimization section of [http://
    www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/LINUX/index-linux.html#TrinityOS] TrinityOS
    - Section 16.
   

Serial based modem users with PPP

  * If you have an external modem, make sure you have a good serial cable.
    Also, many PCs have cheesy ribbon cables connecting the serial port from
    the motherboard or I/O card to the serial port connection. If you have
    one of these, make sure it is in good condition. Personally, I have
    ferrite coils (those grey-black metal like rings) around ALL of my ribbon
    cables.
   
  * Make sure your MTU is set to 1500 as described in the FAQ section of this
    HOWTO above
   
  * Make sure that your serial port is a 16550A or better UART. Run "dmesg |
    more" to verify
   
  * Setup IRQ-Tune for your serial ports.
   
    On most PC hardware, the use of Craig Estey's [http://cae.best.vwh.net/
    irqtune/] IRQTUNE tool and significantly increase serial port performance
    including SLIP and PPP connections.
   
  * Make sure that your serial port for your PPP connection is running at
    115200 (or faster if both your modem and serial port can handle it..
    a.k.a ISDN terminal adapters)
   
      + 2.0.x kernels: The 2.0.x kernels are kind of an odd ball because you
        can't directly tell the kernel to clock the serial ports at 115200.
        So, in one of your startup scripts like the /etc/rc.d/rc.local or /
        etc/rc.d/rc.serial file, execute the following commands for a modem
        on COM2:
       
      + setserial /dev/ttyS1 spd_vhi
       
      + In your PPPd script, edit the actual pppd execution line to include
        the speed "38400" per the pppd man page.
       
      + 2.2.x kernels: Unlike the 2.0.x kernels, both the 2.1.x and 2.2.x
        kernels don't have this "spd_vhi" issue.
       
        So, in your PPPd script, edit the actual pppd execution line to
        include the speed "115200" per the pppd man page.
       
   

All interface types:

7.18. ( PORTFW ) - IP Masquerading with PORTFWing seems to break when my line
is idle for long periods

If you have a DSL or Cablemodem, this behavior is unfortunately quite common.
Basically your ISP is putting your connection into a very low priority queue
to better service non-idle connections. The problem is that some enduser's
connections will actually be taken OFFLINE until some traffic from the user's
DSL/Cablemodem connection awakens the ISP's hardware.

  * Some DSL installations can take an idle connection OFFLINE and only be
    checked for activity once every 30 seconds or so.
   
  * Some Cablemodem setups can set an idle connection into a low priority
    queue and only be checked for activity every minute or so.
   

What do I recommend to do? Ping your default gateway every 30 seconds. To do
this, edit the /etc/rc.d/rc.local file and add the following to the bottom of
the file:

         ping -i 30 100.200.212.121 > /dev/null &                            

Replace the 100.200.212.121 with your default router (upstream router).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.19. ( PORTFW - Locally ) - I can't reach my PORTFWed server from the
INTERNAL lan

This is a common problem which is explained in in Section 6.7 under "Note #
2".

Basically, say your domain, acme.com, has an external IP address is 1.2.3.4
and you are PORTFWing all WWW traffic to an internal machine, say,
192.168.1.20. Then as an /internal/ user, you are trying to contact to http:/
/www.acme.com and expect things to work. Well, that isn't correct. Basically,
http://www.acme.com is being resolved to the IP of http://1.2.3.4. What you
really should doing is contacting http://192.168.1.20.

See the difference?

The proper solution to this is to setup a SPLIT DNS server. Internal users
would be configured to use the /internal/ DNS server which would reply with
the 192.168.1.20 address when asked for www.acme.com. All external users will
get a reply from the /external/ server resolving to the the 1.2.3.4 IP
address. From there, IPTABLES/IPCHAINS/IPFWADM would then PORTFW the traffic
to the 192.168.1.20 server like normal.

Another alternative if you only have a few internal machines is to setup a
"hosts" file entry on all internal machines. That entry would basically look
like:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|www.acme.com    192.168.1.20                                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Got it? If you are interested in doing the more scalable DNS approach,
TrinityOS completely covers split and chrooted DNS servers. [http://

Now, if the split DNS server or hosts file idea doesn't interest you, you can
add the following line to your firewall ruleset. Please note that this
section currently doesn't cover the use of REDIR. If you need help with
REDIR, send me an email.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The problem with this approach is that every packet will be going from the
MASQed web client, to the MASQ server, to the MASQed WWW server, and back
again. This is very wasteful on both network bandwidth and server CPU!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.20. ( Logs ) - Now that I have IP Masquerading up, I'm getting all sorts of
weird notices and errors in the SYSLOG log files. How do I read the IPTABLES/
IPCHAINS/IPFWADM firewall errors?

There is probably a few common things that you are going to see:

  * MASQ: Failed TCP Checksum error: You might see this error when a packet
    coming from the Internet gets corrupt in the data section of the packet
    but the rest of it "seems" ok. When the Linux box receives this packet,
    it will calculate the CRC of the packet and determine that its corrupt.
    On most machines running OSes like Microsoft Windows, they just silently
    drop the packets but Linux IP MASQ reports it. If you get a LOT of them
    over your PPP link, first follow the FAQ entry above for "(Performance) -
    Masq seems is slow".
   
    If the (Performance) FAQ tips don't help and you run PPP over dialup or
    PPPoE, you might try adding the line "-vj" (disabled VanJacobson header
    compression) to your /etc/ppp/options file and restart the PPPd
    connection.
   
  * Firewall hits: Because you are on the Internet with a decent firewall,
    you will be surprised with the number of users trying to penetrate your
    Linux box! So what do all these firewall logs mean?
   
    More so, if they are filling your logs, see the next FAQ entry on
    thoughts how to reduce all these log entries.
   
  * The following details are from the [http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/
    LINUX/index-linux.html#TrinityOS] TrinityOS - Section 10 documentation I
    also wrote:
   
        With the use of various firewall rulesets, a given ruleset can either             
        DENY (silently drop) or REJECT traffic (sends back a ICMP error).  If             
        firewall logging is enabled, the errors will show up in the SYSLOG                
        "messages" file found at:                                                         
                                                                                          
            Redhat:         /var/log

        If you take a look at one of these firewall logs, you would see something         
        like:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.21. ( Log Reduction ) - My logs are filling up with packet hits due to the
new "stronger" rulesets. How can I fix this?

So your realizing that a good firewall is catching a LOT of bad Internet
traffic. That's a good thing but it's also filling up your logs to the point
that you won't read them; that's bad. What to do?

What you need to figure out is what traffic you DON"T want to log, explicitly
match those packets in the firewall, and NOT log the packets when you drop
them.

For example, the TrinityOS firewall ruleset in section 10.7 (this would be a
"strongest" ruleset in IPMASQ speak) gives some ideas: [http://
www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/LINUX/TrinityOS/cHTML/TrinityOS-c-10.html]
TrinityOS - Section 10.7

Things I recommend to filter:

  * All RFC1918 address space (TCP/IP address ranges: 10.x.y.z/8,
    172.16-31.y.z/12, and 192.168.y.x/16). You should /never/ receive these
    packets from an Internet connection. If you do, they are most likely
    spoofed packets
   
  * Windows File and Print Sharing (Samba or CIFS): ports 137, 138, 139, and
    445. Windows machines like to talk a lot though most computers don't care
    what they're saying.
   
  * Class-D Multicast addresses (if you don't use Multicast): 224.0.0.0/4
   
  * Class-E and F "future" addresses: 240.0.0.0/5 and 248.0.0.0/5
   

To a much lesser extent, you might want to filter other packets. I recommend
that you verify that you are receiving these specific packet types before you
filter them out.

  * RIP (the routing protocol): port 520
   
  * Some specific forms of ICMP packets - NOT all of them (that will break
    your machine and IPMASQ in general)
   

Finally, you'll probably find that some individual TCP/IP address out on the
Internet always seem to attack your IP. So, in addition to filtering various
PORTS like above, you might want to also filter by specific SOURCE IP address
too. After all, it is *YOUR* firewall.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.22. ( MASQ Security ) - Can I configure IP MASQ to allow Internet users to
directly contact internal MASQed servers?

Yes! With IPPORTFW, you can allow ALL or only a select few Internet hosts to
contact ANY of your internal MASQed computers. This topic is completely
covered in Section 6.7 in this HOWTO.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.23. ( Free Ports ) - I'm getting "kernel: ip_masq_new(proto=UDP): no free
ports." in my SYSLOG files. Whats up?

One of your internal MASQed machines are creating an abnormally high number
of packets destined for the Internet. As the IP Masq server builds the MASQ
table and forwards these packets out over the Internet, the table is quickly
filling. Once the table is filled, it will give you this error.

The only application that I have known which temporarily creates this
situation is a gaming program called "GameSpy". Why? Gamespy builds a server
list and then pings all of the servers in the list (1000s of game servers).
By creating all these pings, it creates 1,000s of quick connections in a VERY
short period of time. Until these sessions timeout via the IP MASQ timeouts,
the MASQ tables become "FULL".

So what can you do about it? Realistically, don't use programs that do things
like this. If you do get this error in your logs, find it and stop using it.
If you really like GameSpy, just don't refresh the server too often.
Regardless, once you stop running this MASQ'ed program, this MASQ error will
go away as these connections will eventually timeout in the MASQ tables.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.24. ( SETSOCKOPT ) - I'm getting "ipfwadm: setsockopt failed: Protocol not
available" when I try to use IPPORTFW!

If you get the error message "ipfwadm: setsockopt failed: Protocol not
available", you AREN'T running your new kernel. Make sure that you moved the
new kernel over, re-run LILO, and then reboot again.

Please see the end of Section 6.7 for full details.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.25. ( SAMBA ) - Microsoft File and Print Sharing and Microsoft Domain
clients don't work through IP Masq!

To properly support Microsoft's SMB protocol, an IP Masq module would need to
be written but there are three viable work-arounds. For more details, please
see [http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;172227] this
Microsoft KnowledgeBase article.

The first way to work around this problem is to configure IPPORTFW from 
Section 6.7 and portfw TCP ports 137, 138, and 139 to the internal Windows
machine's IP address. Though this solution works, it would only work for ONE
internal machine.

The second solution is to install and configure [http://www.samba.org] Samba
on the Linux MASQ server. With Samba running, you can then map your internal
Windows File and Print shares onto the Samba server. Then, you can mount
these newly mounted SMB shares to all of your external clients. Configuring
Samba is fully covered in a HOWTO found in a Linux Documentation Project and
in the TrinityOS document as well.

The third solution is to configure a VPN (virtual private network) between
the two Windows machines or between the two networks. This can either be done
via the PPTP or IPSEC VPN solutions. There is a Section 7.34 patch for Linux
and also a full IPSEC implementation available for both 2.0.x and 2.2.x
kernels. This solution would probably be the most reliable and secure method
of all three solutions.

All of these solutions are NOT covered by this HOWTO. I recommend that you
look at the TrinityOS documentation for IPSEC help and John Hardin's PPTP
page for more information.

Also PLEASE understand that Microsoft's SMB protocol is VERY insecure.
Because of this, running either Microsoft File and Print sharing or Windows
Domain login traffic over the Internet without any encryption is a VERY BAD
idea.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.26. ( IDENT ) - IRC won't work properly for MASQed IRC users. Why?

The main possible reason is because most common Linux distribution's IDENT or
"Identity" servers can't deal with IP Masqueraded links. No worries though,
there are IDENTs out there that will work.

Installing this software is beyond the scope of this HOWTO but each tool has
its own documentation. Here are some of the URLs:

  * [http://freshmeat.net/projects/oidentd/?topic_id=150] Oident is a
    favorite IDENT server for MASQ users.
   
  * [http://freshmeat.net/projects/midentd/?topic_id=24] Mident is another
    popular IDENT server.
   
  * [http://http://home.indyramp.net/lists/masq/insecurity.net/sidentd.gz]
    Sident
   
  * [ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/network/daemons/] Other Idents
   

 

Please note that some Internet IRC servers still won't allow multiple
connections from the same host even if they get Ident info and the users are
different though. Complain to the remote sys admin. :-)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.27. ( IRC DCC ) - mIRC doesn't work with DCC Sends

This is a configuration problem on your copy of mIRC. To fix this, first
disconnect mIRC from the IRC server. Now in mIRC, go to File --> Setup and
click on the "IRC servers tab". Make sure that it is set to port 6667. If you
require other ports, see below. Next, goto File --> Setup --> Local Info and
clear the fields for Local Host and IP Addresses. Now select the checkboxes
for "LOCAL HOST" and "IP address" (IP address may be checked but disabled).
Next under "Lookup Method", configure it for "normal". It will NOT work if
"server" is selected. That's it. Try to the IRC server again.

If you require IRC server ports other than 6667, (for example, 6969) you need
to edit the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall startup file where you load the IRC MASQ
modules. Edit this file and the line for "modprobe ip_masq_irc" and add to
this line "ports=6667,6969". You can add additional ports as long as they are
separated with commas.

Finally, close down any IRC clients on any MASQed machines and re-load the
IRC MASQ module:

/sbin/rmmod ip_masq_irc /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.28. ( IP Aliasing ) - Can IP Masquerade work with only ONE Ethernet network
card?

Yes and no. With the "IP Alias" kernel feature, users can setup multiple
aliased interfaces such as eth0:1, eth0:2, etc but its is NOT recommended to
use aliased interfaces for IP Masquerading. Why? Providing a secure firewall
becomes very difficult with a single NIC card. In addition to this, you will
experience an abnormal amount of errors on this link since incoming packets
will almost simultaneously be sent out at the same time. Because of all this
and NIC cards now costs less than $10, I highly recommend to just get a NIC
card for each MASQed network segment.

Users should also understand that IP Masquerading will only work with a
physical interface such as eth0, eth1, etc. MASQing out an aliased interface
such as "eth0:1, eth1:1, etc" will NOT work. In other words, the following
WILL NOT WORK reliably:

  * It is rumored that you can simply use the destination IP address (the IP
    address associated with the ALIASed interface like eth0:1, etc.) IN PLACE
    of specifing the interface (eth0:1). This solution is not untested --
    please email dranch@trinnet.net if you have any positive or negative
    results
   
  * /sbin/ipchains -A forward -i eth0:1 -s 192.168.0.0/24 -j MASQ"
   
  * /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a m -W eth0:1 -S 192.168.0.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0/0
   

 

If you are still interested in using aliased interfaces, you need to enable
the "IP Alias" feature in the kernel. You will then need to re-compile and
reboot. Once running the new kernel, you need to configure Linux to use the
new interface (i.e. eth0:1, etc.). After that, you can treat it as a normal
Ethernet interface with some restrictions like the one above.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.29. ( Multiple-LANs ) - I have two MASQed LANs but they cannot communicate
with each other!

Please see Section 6.5 for full details.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.30. ( SHAPING ) - I want to be able to limit the speed of specific types of
traffic

I receive lots of emails from people asking something like the following:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|How can I control the internet bandwidth among the LAN PCs behind the IPMASQ    |
|server? Some times any local pc is downloading and it it will take the majority |
|of the bandwidth and thus the other PCs get little bandwidth.                   |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This topic really doesn't have anything to do with IPMASQ and everthing to do
with Linux's built-in traffic shaping and rate-limiting abilities. You will
find information about this on the LDP such as the [http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO
/ADSL-Bandwidth-Management-HOWTO/index.html] ADSL Bandwidth HOWTO, the 
Advanced Rouring HOWTO, and the Bandwidth Limiting HOWTO. Please understand
this is an advanced topic and any question you may have will be better served
from people from those forums.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.31. ( ACCOUNTING ) - I need to do accounting on who is using the network

Though this doesn't have much to do with IPMASQ, here are a few ideas. If you
know of a better solution, please email the author of this HOWTO so it can be
added to the HOWTO.

 

  * Idea #1: You could run the command:
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |IPCHAINS: "ipchains -L -M"                                     |
    |                                                               |
    |IPTABLES: "cat /proc/net/ip_conntrack"                         |
    |                                                               |

    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
    once a second and log all of those entries. You could then write a
    program to merge this information into one large file. Again, this will
    only provide you with the remote IP address and nothing about the content
    viewed or downloaded.
   
  * Idea #2: Log every packet: You can match any specific traffic flows but
    this method will create VERY LARGE log files. Unfortunately, these log
    files aren't very readable and it doesn't tell you what was transfered
    (FTP files, etc.). Fortunately, setting up this form of accounting is
    easy.
   
  * Idea #3: Say you want to log all traffic going out onto the internet. You
    can setup a firewall rule to accept port 80 traffic with with the SYN bit
    set and log it. Now mind you, this will create smaller log files than the
    idea above but you will only know the destination IP address and NOT the
    WWW pages viewed.
   
  * Idea #4: Transparent Proxy: This method really doesn't use IPMASQ since
    it requires the installation and setup of the Squid HTTP/FTP proxy
    server. The benefit of this method is that internal users won't notice
    anything different in terms of connectivity but now the SysAdmin gets a
    LOT more information (files downloaded, etc). But, there are pros/cons to
    setting this up:
   
    Pro:
   
      + + full logging of all transferred files and issues FTP commands
       
      + + you can enable caching on the proxy server. With caching, you can
        save bandwidth since once a file is downloaded, any identical file
        requests will be served via the cache and not redownloaded via the
        Internet connection.
       
   
    Con:
   
      + - Setting up a transparent proxy is complicated as it requires kernel
        changes, setting up Squid, etc.
       
      + - Could be overkill for a small installation.

7.32. ( MULTIPLE IPs - DMZ segments) - I have several EXTERNAL IP addresses
that I want to PORTFW to several internal machines. How do I do this?

You DON'T do this with MASQ.

MASQ is a 1:Many NAT setup which is the incorrect tool to perform what you
are looking for. You are looking for is either Many:Many NAT solution or a
Briding setup.

NOTE: For users out there who are thinking about enabling multiple IP
addresses on one internal NIC using "IP Alias" and then just PORTFWeding ALL
of those ports (0-65535), and and finally use IPROUTE2 to maintain the proper
source/destination IP pairs. This has been done SUCCESSFULLY on 2.0.x kernels
and less successfully on 2.2.x kernels. Regardless of success, that isn't the
proper way to do it, it's a total HACK, and it is not a supported MASQ
configuration. Please, give IPTABLES on the 2.4.x kernels a serious look or
to a much lesser extent, Section 7.30 IPROUTE2 look for 2.2.x kernels.

Anyway, for forwarding external IP address to internal hosts, you basically
have three possibilites:

  * +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |1. Route the external IPs                                                    |
    |                                                                             |
    |   (This does NOT involve IPMASQ at all but requires special WAN addressing  |
    |    and routing setup from your ISP):                                        |
    |                                                                             |
    |    Internet -- Some public WAN -- Linux -- DMZ segment                      |
    |                   IP address      Server     PUBLIC IPs                     |
    |                                     |                                       |
    |                                     +------ Internal net                    |
    |                                              private IPs                    |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   
  * +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |2. 1:1 NAT                                                                 |
    |                                                                           |
    |   (Most easily done via IPTABLES or with IPCHAINS and IPROUTE2 but still  |
    |    some protocols cannot deal with NAT)                                   |
    |                                                                           |
    |    Internet -- Linux -- DMZ segment                                       |

    |                            private IPs                                    |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   
  * +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |3. Bridging:                                                                    |
    |                                                                                |
    |   This is how most commercial firewalls do it as it's very slick.  Basically,  |
    |   all public IPs transparently flow through the Linux server to the DMZ but    |
    |   via firewall inspection.                                                     |
    |                                                                                |

    |                  |                                                             |
    |                  +------ Internal net                                          |
    |                           private IPs                                          |

Though this howto doesn't cover items #1 and #2 yet, email me and I can give
you a hand. For item #3, this isn't IPMASQ anymore and thus I can't help you.
Fortunately, there are a few HOWTOs out there on the topic:

  * [http://bridge.sourceforge.net/] http://bridge.sourceforge.net/
   
  * [http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Ethernet-Bridge-netfilter-HOWTO.html] http://
    www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Ethernet-Bridge-netfilter-HOWTO.html
   

NOTE: If you have a bridged DSL or Cablemodem connection (not PPPoE), things
are a little more difficult because your setup isn't routed. No worries
though, check out the Bridge+Firewall Mini HOWTO and the [http://www.tldp.org
/HOWTO/mini/Bridge+Firewall+DSL.html] Bridge+Firewall+DSL Mini HOWTO. These
HOWTOs will teach you how to get your Linux box to support multiple IP
addresses on a single interface!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.33. ( Netstat ) - I'm trying to use the NETSTAT command to show my
Masqueraded connections but its not working

There might be a problem with the "netstat" program in 2.0.x-based Linux
distros. After a Linux reboot, running "netstat -M" works fine but after a
MASQed computer runs some successful ICMP traffic like ping, traceroute,
etc., you might see something like:

masq_info.c: Internal Error `ip_masquerade unknown type'.

The workaround for this is to use the "/sbin/ipfwadm -M -l" command. You will
also notice that once the listed ICMP masquerade entries timeout, "netstat"
works again.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.34. ( VPNs ) - I would like to get Microsoft PPTP (GRE tunnels) and/or
IPSEC (Linux SWAN) tunnels running through IP MASQ

This IS possible for specific modes. Specifically, all of the kernel versions
(2.4.x, 2.2.x, and 2.0.x) support patches to allow for both ONE or MULTIPLE
PPTP users behind a IPMASQ server to connect to the -same- PPTP server. The
2.4.x kernels currently have a PPTP module now in the newest versions of the
IPTABLES program and there is another version available on the IPMASQ WWW
site. Please check out John Hardin's [http://www.impsec.org/linux/masquerade/
ip_masq_vpn.html] PPTP Masq page for details.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.35. ( Games ) - I want to get the XYZ network game to work through IP MASQ
but it won't work. Help!

First, check Steve Grevemeyer's MASQ Applications page. If your solution
isn't listed there, try patching your Linux kernel with Glenn Lamb's http://
ipmasq.webhop.net/files20/loose-udp-2.0.36.patch.gz LooseUDP patch which is
covered in Section 6.10 above. Also check out Dan Kegel's [http://
www.alumni.caltech.edu/~dank/peer-nat.html] NAT Page for more information.

If you are technically inclined, use the program "tcpdump" and sniff your
network. Try to find out what protocols and port numbers your XYZ game is
using. With this information in hand, subscribe to the [mailto://
masq-subscribe@tiffany.indyramp.com] IP Masq email list and email your
results for help.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.36. ( Stops working ) - IP MASQ works fine for a while but then it stops
working. A reboot seems to fix this. Why?

I bet you are using IPAUTOFW and/or you have it compiled into the kernel
huh?? This is a known problem with IPAUTOFW. It is recommend to NOT even
configure IPAUTOFW into the Linux kernel and use IPPORTFW option instead.
This is covered with more details in Section 6.7.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.37. ( SMTP Relay ) - Internal MASQed computers cannot send SMTP or POP-3
mail!

Though this isn't a Masquerading issue but many users do this so it should be
mentioned.

SMTP: The issue is that you are probably using your Linux box as an SMTP
relay server and get the following error:

 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|"error from mail server: we do not relay"                                  |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Newer versions of Sendmail and other Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) disable
relaying by default (this is a good thing). So do the following to fix this:

 

  * Sendmail: Enable specific relaying for your internal MASQed machines by
    editing the /etc/sendmail.cw file and add the hostname and domain name of
    your internal MASQed machine. You should also check to see that the /etc/
    hosts file has the IP address and Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
    configured in it. Once this is done, you need to restart Sendmail for it
    to re-read its configuration files. This is covered in [http://
    www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/LINUX/index-linux.html#TrinityOS] TrinityOS
    - Section 25 
   

 

POP-3: Some users configure their internal MASQ'ed computer's POP-3 clients
to connect to some external SMTP server. While this is fine, many SMTP
servers out there will try to IDENT your connection on port 113. Most likely
your problem stems around your default Masquerade policy being set to DENY.
This is BAD. Set it to REJECT and re-run your rc.firewall ruleset.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.38. ( Source Routing ) - I need different internal MASQed networks to exit
on different external IP addresses

Say you have the following setup: You have multiple internal networks and
also multiple external IP addresses and/or networks. What you want to do is
have LAN #1 to only use External IP #1 but you wan LAN #2 to use External IP
#2.

Internal LAN ----------> official IP

LAN #1 External IP #1 192.168.1.x --> 123.123.123.11

LAN #2 External IP #2 192.168.2.x --> 123.123.123.12

Basically, what we have described here is routing NOT only on the destination
address (typical IP routing) but also routing based upon the SOURCE address
as well. This is typically called "policy-based routing" or "source routing".
This functionality is NOT available in 2.0.x kernels, it *IS* available for
2.2.x kernels via the IPROUTE2 package, and it is built into the new 2.4.x
kernels using IPTABLES.

First, you have to understand that both IPFWADM and IPCHAINS get involved *
AFTER* the routing system has decided where to send a given packet. This
statement really ought to be stamped in big red letters on all IPFWADM/
IPCHAINS/IPMASQ documentation. The reason for this is that users MUST first
have their routing setup correct, then start adding IPFWADM/IPCHAINS and/or
Masq features.

Anyways, for the example case shown above, you will need to persuade the
routing system to direct packets from 192.168.1.x via 123.123.1233.11 and
packets from 192.168.2.x via 123.123.123.12. That is the hardest part and
adding Masq on top of correct routing is easy.

To do this fancy routing, you will use IPROUTE2. Because this functionality
has NOTHING to do with IPMASQ, this HOWTO does not cover this topic in great
detail. Please see Section 2.7 for complete URLs and documentation for this
topic.

The "iprule" and "iproute" commands are the same as "ip rule" and "ip route"
commands (I prefer the former since it is easier to search for.) All the
commands below are completely untested, if they do not work, please let David
Ranch know about it but please contact the IPROUTE2 email list for help. This
function has NOTHING to do with IP Masquerading.

2.4.x. kernels:

The following would be integrated into the END of your rc.firewall-2.4
ruleset
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| EXTIF="eth0"                                                              |

| INTNET2="192.168.2.0/24"                                                  |

2.2.x. kernels:

The first few commands only need to be done once at boot, say in /etc/rc.d/
rc.local file.

|                                                                             |
|# Table 101 forces all assigned packets out via 123.123.123.11               |
|  /sbin/iproute add table 101 via 123.123.123.11                             |

|At this stage, you should find that packets from 192.168.1.x to the          |
|outside world are being routed via 123.123.123.11, packets from              |
|192.168.2.x are routed via 123.123.123.12.                                   |
|                                                                             |
|It is IMPORTANT that these IPROUTE2 rules be run /BEFORE/ the rc.firewall    |
|ruleset is run.                                                              |
|                                                                             |
|If everything hangs together, the masq code will see packets being           |
|routed out on 123.123.123.11 and 123.123.123.12 and will use those addresses |
|as the masq source address.                                                  |

7.39. ( IPCHAINS rulesets on 2.4.x kernels ) - What the ipchains.o module can
do on 2.4.x kernels

Some people would like to continue using their legacy IPCHAINS rulesets on
2.4.x-based kernelw. Unfortunately, unless you are only doing packet
firewalling and not trying to do any NATing (MASQ), PORTFW, or other advanced
features, you're in trouble.

  * If you ARE only doing IPCHAINS filtering, all you need to do is unload
    all IPTABLES modules shown from the "/sbin/lsmod" command. After that,
    load the IPCHAINS module by running "/sbin/modprobe ipchains". After
    that, load your IPCHAINS ruleset as normal.
   
      + Please note that if you compiled IPTABLES support statically into the
        kernel, you CANNOT load the "ipchains" module (it shouldn't be even
        present) as it will conflict with the IPTABLES kernel code. Your ONLY
        option in this case is to recompile your kernel but make the IPTABLES
        and IPCHAINS options as modules.
       
   

So why can't you run IPCHAINS MASQ/PORTFW functionality with a 2.4.x kernel?
Once the IPCHAINS module is loaded, you CANNOT use any IPTABLES commands or
modules since the code conflicts. In addition to this, you cannot use any
legacy 2.2.x IPCHAINS masq modules on a 2.4.x kernel as the kernels are so
radically different. Plus, this really shouldn't be an issue as all of this
functionality is available via native IPTABLES modules now. Finally, you
cannot use the IPMASQADM tool with a 2.4.x kernel as the program both won't
compile and ultimately the PORTFW kernel handlers aren't present anymore
(it's now done natively by the IPTABLES code). So, considering all of these
facts:

  * You cannot run any form of PORTFW on this 2.4.x machine
   
  * Protocols that require special handling like FTP, IRC, CuSeeme,
    RealAudio, etc. will no longer work
   

Basically, the ipchains kernel module included with the 2.4.x kernels is
intended for basic packet firewall compatibility and NOT any NAT(MASQ)
functionality.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.40. ( IPTABLES vs. IPCHAINS vs. IPFWADM ) - Why do the 2.4.x, 2.2.x, and
2.0.x kernels use different firewall systems?

IPTABLES supports the following features that IPCHAINS and IPFWADM doesn't:

 

  * Stateful IPv4 protocol and application tracking
   
  * Stateful IPv6 protocol tracking
   
  * True 1:1 and 1:Many NAT
   
  * Built-in PORTFW functionality
   
  * See the Section 2.6 section for more details
   

 

IPCHAINS supports the following features that IPFWADM doesn't:

 

  * "Quality of Service" (QoS support)
   
  * A TREE style chains system vs. LINEAR system like IPFWADM (Eg. this
    allows something like "if it is ppp0, jump to this chain (which contains
    its own difference set of rules)"
   
  * IPCHAINS is more flexible with configuration. For example, it has the
    "replace" command (in addition to "insert" and "add"). You can also
    negate rules (e.g. "discard any outbound packets that don't come from my
    registered IP" so that you aren't the source of spoofed attacks).
   
  * IPCHAINS can filter any IP protocol explicitly, not just TCP, UDP, ICMP
   

 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.41. ( Upgrades ) - I've just upgraded to the x.y.z kernel, why isn't IP
Masquerade working?

There are several things you should check assuming your Linux IP Masq box
already has proper connections to the Internet and your LAN:

 

  * Make sure you have the necessary features and modules are compiled and
    loaded. See earlier sections for details.
   
  * Check /usr/src/linux/Documentation/Changes and make sure you have the
    minimal requirement for the network tools installed.
   
  * Make sure you followed all of the tests in Chapter 5 of the HOWTO.
   
  * Make sure you are using the proper firewall tool for you kernel be it
    IPTABLES, IPCHAINS, or IPFWADM.
   
  * If you are doing PORTFW functionality, make sure you use the correct tool
    for your kernel version. IPTABLES has everything built-in, IPCHAINS
    requires the use of IPMASQADM, and IPFWADM reaquires the use of IPPORTFW
    or IPAUTOFW. This is completely covered in Section 6.7.
   
  * Go through all setup and configuration again! Usually, it's just a typo
    or a simple mistake you are overlooking.
   

 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.42. ( EQL ) - I need help with EQL connections and IP Masq

EQL has nothing to do with IP Masq though they are commonly teamed up on
Linux boxes. Because of this, I recommend checking out the NEW version of
[http://home.indyramp.com/masq/eql/eql.html] Robert Novak's EQL HOWTO for all
your EQL needs.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.43. ( Wussing out ) - I can't get IP Masquerade to work! What options do I
have for Windows Platforms?

Looking to give up a free, reliable, high performance solution that works on
minimal hardware and pay a fortune for something that needs more hardware, is
lower performance and did I say less reliable? (IMHO. And yes, I have real
life experience with these ;-)

Okay, it's your call. If you want a Windows NAT and/or proxy solution, here
is a decent listing. I don't prefer any one of these tools over another,
especially since I haven't used them before.

  * Firesock (from the makers of Trumpet Winsock)
   
      + Does Proxy
       
      + [http://www.trumpet.com.au] http://www.trumpet.com.au
       
   
  * Iproute
   
      + DOS program designed to run on 286+ class computers
       
      + requires another box like Linux MASQ
       
      + (UNAVAILABLE) www.mischler.com/iproute/
       
   
  * Microsoft Proxy
   
      + Requires Windows NT Server
       
      + Quite expensive
       
      + [http://www.microsoft.com] http://www.microsoft.com
       
   
  * NAT32
   
      + Windows 95/98/NT compatible
       
      + [http://www.nat32.com] http://www.nat32.com
       
      + Roughly $25 for Win9x and $47 for Win9x and WinNT
       
   
  * SyGate
   
      + [http://www.sygate.com] http://www.sygate.com
       
     
  * Wingate
   
      + Does proxy
       
      + Costs roughly $30 for 2-3 IPs
       
      + [http://www.wingate.com] http://www.wingate.com
       
     
  * Winroute
   
      + Does NAT
       
      + [http://www.kerio.com/kerio.html] WinRoute
       
     

Lastly, do a web search on "MS Proxy Server", "Wingate", "WinProxy", or goto
[http://www.download.com] www.download.com. And definitely DON'T tell anyone
that we sent you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.44. ( Developers ) - I want to help with IP Masquerade development. What
can I do?

Join the Linux IP Masquerading DEVELOPERS list and ask the developers there
what you can do to help. For more details on joining the list, check out 
Section 7.5 FAQ section.

Please DON'T ask NON-IP-Masquerade development related questions there!!!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.45. ( More INFO ) - Where can I find more information on IP Masquerade?

You can find more information on IP Masquerade at the [http://
ipmasq.webhop.net/] Linux IP Masquerade Resource that Ambrose Au maintains.

You can also find more information at [http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/
LINUX/index-linux.html] Dranch's Linux page where the TrinityOS and other
Linux documents are kept.

You may also find more information at [http://home.indyramp.net/mailman/
listinfo/masq] The Semi-Original Linux IP Masquerading Web Site maintained by
Indyramp Consulting, who also provides the IP Masq mailing list.

Lastly, you can look for specific questions in the IP MASQ and IP MASQ DEV
email archives or ask a specific question on these lists. Check out Section
7.5 FAQ item for more details.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.46. ( Translators ) - I want to translate this HOWTO to another language,
what should I do?

Make sure the language you want to translate to is not already covered by
someone else. But, most of the translated HOWTOs are now OLD and need to be
updated. A list of available HOWTO translations are available at the [http://
ipmasq.webhop.net/] Linux IP Masquerade Resource.

If a copy of a current IP MASQ HOWTO isn't in your proposed language, please
download the newest copy of the IP-MASQ HOWTO SGML code from the Linux IP
Masquerade Resource. From there, begin your work while maintaining good SGML
coding. For more help on SGML, check out [http://www.sgmltools.org]
www.sgmltools.org
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.47. ( Updates ) - This HOWTO seems out of date, are you still maintaining
it? Can you include more information on ...? Are there any plans for making
this better?

Yes, this HOWTO is still being maintained. In the past, Ambrose was guilty of
being too busy working on two jobs and didn't have much time to work on this,
my apologies. As of v1.50, David Ranch revamped the document and got it
current again.

If you think of a topic that could be included in the HOWTO, please send
email [mailto:dranch@trinnet.net] dranch@trinnet.net. It will be even better
if you can provide that information. We will then include the information
into the HOWTO once it is both found appropriate and tested. Many thanks for
your contributions!

We have a lot of new ideas and plans for improving the HOWTO, such as case
studies that will cover different network setup involving IP Masquerade, more
on security via strong IPFWADM/IPCHAINS firewall rulesets, IPCHAINS usage,
more FAQ entries, etc. If you think you can help, please do! Thanks.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.48. ( Thanks ) - I got IP Masquerade working, it's great! I want to thank
you guys, what can I do?

 

  * Can you translate the newer version of the HOWTO to another language?
   
  * Thank the developers and appreciate the time and effort they spent on
    this.
   
  * Join the IP Masquerade email list and support new MASQ users
   
  * Send an email to us and let us know how happy you are
   
  * Introduce other users to Linux and help them when they have problems.

    Forward to the IPMASQ email list; Updated the dates in the copyright
    notice;
   
  * 05/24/03: Updated the "Current Status" to add the remark that some

    NAT modules are no longer required
   
  * 05/24/03: Updated the 2.4 Requirements section: deleted a duplicate line
    (true 1:1 NAT); cleaned some addition things up; Added CuSeeme to the 2.4

  * 05/24/03: Updated the Compiling Linux 2.2.x / 2.0.x section: Deleted the
    recommendations to load the rc.firewall ruleset via rc.local. This should
    come later in the HOWTO and offer other methods for different Linux
    distributions
   
  * 05/24/03: Updated the ICQ Application section to say that these steps are
    /not/ required for modern ICQ clients. I've left this section in the
    HOWTO to demonstrate a large PORTFW example
   
  * 05/24/03: Made some of the FAQ entries more kernel version generic and
    also deleted the 2.0.x "upgrades-cont.html" FAQ entry as it was basically
    a duplicate
   
  * 05/24/03: Updated the LooseUDP game section to explain how it works,
    explain how much of this was properly solved under the stateful IPTABLES
    systtem, and also say that it is NOT available for the 2.4.x kernels. If
    IPTABLES's stateful UDP tracking doesn't work for, you're probably out of
    luck.
   
  * 05/24/03: Mentioned in the FAQ section that MASQ timers are NOT
    adjustable under IPTABLES
   
  * 05/24/03: Vastly expanded the packet firewall log FAQ entry and finally
    added a IPTABLES packet log description section. I also aligned the
    IPCHAINS example to match the IPFWADM entry
   
  * 04/11/03: Fixed a incorrect echo statement saying the IPTABLES policy was
    being set to REJECT and not DROP.
   

Changes from 01/31/03 to 04/08/03

  * 04/08/03: Added additional formatting and the "ip_masquerade" /proc entry
    into Section 3.2. This helps users determine if their kernel is
    MASQ-ready.
   
  * 03/08/03: Added the EXTIP variable to the 2.4.x PORTFW example as several
    people were trying to use this with the BASIC ruleset and I had assumed
    they were using the STRONGER ruleset. Thanks to Greg Lukins for bringing
    this to my attention.
   
  * 03/08/03: Added Distros to the MASQ compatibility list: Mandrake, Gentoo
   
  * 02/08/03: Forgot to update the VERSION number for the
    rc.firewall-2.4-stronger rulese. Added some additional formatting
   
  * 02/01/03: Added additional checking in the kernel compiling section to
    understand if your kernel supports IPMASQ via modules or by being
    statically compiled in.
   

Changes from 01/12/03 to 01/31/03

  * 01/31/03: Doh. I should have read my own comments. I've reversed the
    2.4.x. policy settings from REJECT back to DROP. REJECT, for some lame
    reason, is not a legal policy. The recommended REJECT action is still
    carried out via the "drop-and-log-it" user chain.
   
  * 01/30/03: Updated the Multiple-IPs FAQ entry to better describe how users
    that want to put external IPs behind a Linux router. Added additional
    URLs and cleaned up the text a bit too.
   
  * 01/30/03: Updated the 2.4.x requirement section to reflect more of the
    pros of IPTABLES as well as updated the update status of some old legacy
    2.2.x modules
   
  * 01/30/03: Added an additional FAQ entry that clearly explains what the
    ipchains.o module can and CANNOT do on 2.4.x. kernels
   
  * 01/28/03: Extensively updated the 2.4.x kernel compilation section to
    reflect a 2.4.20 kernel with IPTABLES 1.2.7a. The section also reflects
    the new methods to compile IPTABLES, apply Patch-O-Matic patches, and
    also included lots of example output too.
   
  * 01/28/03: Updated the kernel compiling section to be a little more clear
    on how different Linux distros can have different kernels (modules vs.
    monolithic)
   
  * 01/17/03: Fixed a major issue where the rc.firewall-2.2-stronger ruleset
    was referencing missing executable variables. This was taken from the
    2.4-stronger ruleset but I guess I forgot to finish it off. Fixed. Thanks
    to Samuel Kim for catching this!
   
  * 01/17/03: Fixed an issue where the rc.firewall-2.2-stronger's commented
    HTTP section was missing the "-p tcp" option. Thanks to Samuel Kim for
    catching this!
   
  * 01/16/03: Updated the URL for DJSF's ICQ module
   
  * 01/16/03: Changed the default policy and drop chain from DENY to REJECT
    on both IPTABLES rulesets and on the advanced IPFWADM rulset. Thanks to
    Jonathan Hutchins for bringing this to my attention.
   
  * 01/16/03: Fixed a typo in the commented out HTTPd OUTPUT section of the
    rc.firewall-2.2-s ruleset
   
  * 01/13/03: Updated the IPMASQ www site URL from ipmasq.cjb.net to
    ipmasq.webhop.net. CJB started to change their policies so we switched.
   
  * 01/13/03: Added to the 2.4.x Requirements section that IPTABLES v1.2.7a
    is out and recommended.
   
  * 01/13/03: Added an additional test item to the "Test Section - Section 5"
    for versions of IPTABLES that are too old. I also cleaned up this section
    to read easier.
   
  * 01/13/03: Updated the rc.firewall-2.4-stronger ruleset to include
    commented rules to allow in HTTP traffic to a local HTTP server. Also
    added a rule comment in the FORWARD section to help users know where to
    put PORTFW commands.
   
  * 01/13/03: Updated the rc.firewall-2.2-stronger ruleset to include
    commented rules to allow in HTTP traffic to a local HTTP server. Also
    added a rule comment in the FORWARD section to help users know where to
    put PORTFW commands.
   
  * 01/13/03: Clarified the PORTFW section to help users better understand
    where the PORTFW commands should go in the rc.firewall rulesets. I also
    cleaned up this section to read a little better.
   

Changes from 12/13/02 to 01/12/03

  * 01/03/03: Added Redhat 7.3 and 8.0 to the compatibility chart.

    eye.
   
  * 12/22/02: Updated the 2.2.x H.323 kernel patch URL. Thanks to Maxime
    Plante for pointing this out.
   
  * 12/22/02: Updated the 2.4.x kernel compiling section to let users know
    that most modern kernels don't need IPTABLES Patch-o-matic patches to be
    applied except to fix bugs or add additional functionality.
   

Changes from 10/20/02 to 12/13/02

  * 11/27/02: Fixed the init.d scripts to point the header to the correct
    config file. This must be due to newer versions of "chkconfig" doing
    better checking. Please note that this might still be a problem for the
    rc.firewall-2.?-stronger rulesets. Thanks to Joris Van Puyenbroeck for
    the heads up.
   
  * 11/25/02: Updated all the firewall comments to reflect that PPPoE users
    need to user the "ppp0" logical interface as their external interface
    instead of the physical interface such as "eth0". Thanks to Meng Cheah
    for the nudge.
   
  * 11/13/02: Updated the URL for the Donald Becker based NIC drivers. Thanks
    to Bruce Gorgon for the heads up.
   
  * 11/01/02: Added a new FAQ section that covers redirection of local
    INTERNAL traffic to internal PORTFWed servers
   
  * 11/01/02: Updated the PORTFW section to be a little more clear.
   

Changes from 04/19/02 to 10/20/02

  * 09/29/02: Fixed a stray incorrect IP address pointing to metalab.unc.edu
   
  * 08/29/02: Fixed a typo in the firewall-2.2 startup script which was
    starting the 2.4 firewall and not the 2.2. version. Thanks to Jean-Marc
    Vanel for catching this.
   
  * 08/25/02: Updated the rc.firewall-2.2-stronger and rc.firewall-2.2
    scripts to use shell environment variables.
   
  * 07/09/02: Updated the FTP PORTFW section to be more readible
   
  * 07/06/02: Replaced all the filewatcher.org URLs with netfilter.org URLs
   
  * 06/12/02: Changed some of the formatting to try and help newbies better
    understand that the "\" character is used as a continuation of the
    previous line.
   
  * 06/12/02: Updated the IP address of metalab.unc.edu in Section 5. Thanks
    to Pete Trachy for bringing this to my attention but please note that
    even major sites like Metalab change their IPs, subnets, or even ISPs
    from time to time.
   
  * 06/02/02: Updated the rc.firewall-2.4 ruleset to include a commented
    option for NATing IRC DCCs, added the use of more environment vars, and
    added additional formatting.
   
  * 05/18/02: Added some extra # lines the commented section of the the
    rc.firewall-2.4-stronger ruleset to better serve Cut and Paste users.
   
  * 05/04/02: - Updated the various PPTP MASQ links to point to a valid URL.
    Also updated the HOWTO to reflect that PPTP is now supported on the 2.4.x
    kernels.
   
  * 05/03/02: - Updated the 2.4.x kernel requirements section to point out
    that IPCHAINS compatibility under 2.4.x kernels isn't very good. If you
    want to use IPMASQ under a 2.4.x kernel, you should use IPTABLES rules
    only.
   

Changes from 01/05/02 to 04/19/02 - v2.00.041902 pubsished to the LDP

  * 04/01/02: - Updated the rc.firewall-2.4-stronger ruleset to denote and

  * 01/05/02: - Added required changes to the loading of the ip_conntrack_ftp
    module if people PORTFW to non-standard FTP ports.
   
  * 01/05/02: - Added an example in the 2.4.x PORTFW section on how to
    REDIRECT internal traffic back to an INTERNAL server. This is the same as

    Thanks to Bruno Negrao for this one.
   
  * 12/02/01: - Fixed some minor version typos in the 2.4.x rc.firewall
    ruleset; Added a missing $PORTFWIF variable for the 2.4.x PORTFW example.
    Thanks to Neil Bunn for the errata.
   
  * 11/25/01: - Expanded on the ipchains module conflict error messages in

Changes from 08/26/01 to 11/18/01 - 111801 published to the LDP

  * 11/12/01: - updated various comments to reflect new versions:linux
    2.4.14, iptables 1.2.4, and linux 2.2.20.

  * 11/10/01: - Added the directly downloadable versions of the 2.4,
    2.4-stronger, 2.2, 2.2-stronger, 2.0, and and 2.0.x-stronger rulesets to
    the WWW.
   
  * 11/10/01: - Updated the 2.4.x PORTW example to add the missing FORWARD
    option.
   
  * 11/10/01: - Updated the DSL-HOWTO link in the HOWTO
   
  * 10/27/01: - Updated the network diagram in section 2.5 to be a little
    more verbose.

    2.4.x, 2.2.x, and 2.0.x kernel compiling recommendations.
   
  * 09/16/01: - Cleaned up and updated the PORTFW section to also include
    PREROUTING examples for 2.4.x kernels.
   
  * 09/13/01: - Updated the IPTABLES simple rc.firewall ruleset to 0.62. This
    fixed a typo on the MASQ enable line that used eth0 instead of $EXTIF.
    Thanks to Hafi for reporting this.
   
  * 09/07/01: - It seems that most people who are getting IPCHAINS and
    IPTABLES conflicts are running Redhat 7.1. I have updated section 5 on
    how to fix this. Thanks to Jason Wenzel for helping me with this.
   
  * 09/07/01: - Noted that IPTABLES v1.2.3 is current version. All versions
    less than v1.2.3 have an FTP module bug that can bypass strong firewall
    rulesets. Please upgrade your copy of IPTABLES now.
   
  * 09/07/01: - Created version numbers for the simple rc.firewall rulesets
    (IPTABLES - v0.61) (IPCHAINS - v1.01) (IPFWADM - v2.01). and cleaned up
    some of the comments in each section.
   
  * 09/07/01: - Added rules to the simple rc.firewall rulesets to flush the
    various tables. In addition to this, I have added the use of environment
    variables and more echo statements in the rulesets to make things easier
    to edit and monitor. Thanks to Ian Bishop for the good idea.
   
  * 09/07/01: - Added the use of EXTIF and INTIF interface variables in each
    of the rc.firewall and partial firewall rulesets for better clarity
    (similar to how TrinityOS has been doing for a while now). Thanks to Sean
    McKeon for the nudge.
   
  * 09/07/01: - Fixed a typo in the UNIX client configuration section where
    the network broadcast was 192.168.0.25 instead of .255.
   

 

Changes from 2.01 to 2.05 - 08/26/01

  * 08/19/01: - Added an additional testing step in Section5 to make sure the
    rc.firewall file loads ok. Thanks to Steven Levis for the good idea.
   
  * 08/15/01: - Change the reference for the /etc/hosts file from RFC952 to
    RFC1035. Thanks to Michael F. Maggard for the correction.
   

 

Changes from 1.96 to 2.01 - 08/12/01

  * 08/12/01: - Updated the basic IPTABLES ruleset to 0.60 which fixed a
    major issue where all MASQed packets were being dropped. Ultimately, I
    forgot to add a rule to ACCEPT correct packets through the forwarding
    chain.
   
  * - Added an additional rule to log all bogus FORWARD packets
   
  * - Load the FTP nat modules now by default
   
  * - Changed the load order of some of the kernel modules to not create
    bogus error messages
   
  * - Added an IPTABLES section on how to MASQ specific hosts vs. an entire
    subnet
   
  * - Added more MASQ-client compatible operating systems
   

  * 07/19/01: - The advanced IPCHAINS example for forwarding between multiple
    interfaces was missing the critital "-j ACCEPT" to actually let the
    packets flow. Thanks to Shingo Yamaguchi for catching this.
   

Changes from 1.96 to 2.00 - 06/10/01

  * 06/21/01: Updated Section 5 (Testing Section) to add an additional test
    to help users troubleshoot their MASQ setup. There are now a total of
    -11- tests. 06/16/01: Updated the intro History section at the beginning
    of the HOWTO. 06/14/01: Added mirror Netfilter and IPCHAINs mirror URLs
    06/13/01: Updated the H.323 URL
   
  * 06/10/01: Double DOH! The simple rc.firewall script for the 2.4 kernels
    had two major errors in it. The new version is far more informative and
    even works! I am continuing to go through the HOWTO and cleaning things
    up but I'm not done quite yet.
   
  * 06/02/01: Updated the lists of known compatible MASQ'ed operating systems
    (Windows M3, Linux 2.3, 2.4, etc) Made more references to DHCP and DNS in
    the various different MASQ client configuration guides.
   
  *  04/12/01: Thanks to the Joshua X and the other people at Command Prompt,
    Inc. for the port of the HOWTO from LinuxDoc to DocBook. Add email list
    URL to line 126
   

Changes from 1.90 to 1.95 - 11/11/00

  * A BIG thanks to the Joshua X and the other people at Command Prompt, Inc.
    for the port of the HOWTO from LinuxDoc to DocBook.
   
  * Added a quick upfront notice in the intro that running a SINGLE NIC in
    MASQ mutliple ethernet segments is NOT recommended and linked to the
    relivant FAQ entry. Thanks to Daniel Chudnov for helping the HOWTO be
    more clear.
   
  * Added a pointer in the Intro section to the FAQ section for users looking
    for how MASQ is different from NAT and Proxy services.
   
  * Reordered the Kernel requirements sections to be 2.2.x, 2.4.x, 2.0.x
   
  * Expanded the kernel testing in Section 3 to see if a given kernel already
    supports MASQ or not.
   
  * Reversed the order of the displayed simple MASQ ruleset examples (2.2.x
    and 2.0.x)
   
  * Cleaned up some formatting issues in the 2.0.x and 2.2.x rc.firewall
    files
   
  * Noted in the 2.2.x rc.firewall that the defrag option is gone in some
    distro's proc (Debian, TurboLinux, etc)
   
  * Added a NOTE #3 to the rc.firewall scripts to include instructions for
    Pump. Thanks to Ross Johnson for this one.
   
  * Cleaned up the simple MASQ ruleset examples for both the 2.2.x and 2.2.x
    kernels
   
  * Updated the simple and stronger IPCHAINS and IPFWADM rulesets to include
    the external interface names (IPCHAINS is -i; IPFWADM is -W) to avoid
    some internal traffic MASQing issues.
   
  * Vastly expanded the Section 5 (testing) with even more testing steps with
    added complete examples of what the output of the testing commands should
    look like.
   
  * Moved the H.323 application documentation from NOT supported to
    Supported. :-)
   
  * Reordered the Multiple LAN section examples (2.2.x then 2.0.x)
   
  * Made some additional clarifications to the Multiple LAN examples
   
  * Fixed a critical typo with multiple NIC MASQing where the network
    examples had the specified networks reversed. Thanks to Matt Goheen for
    catching this.
   
  * Added a little intro to MFW in the PORTFW section.
   
  * Reveresed the 2.0.x and 2.2.x sections for PORTFW
   
  * Updated the news regarding PORTFWing FTP traffic for 2.2.x kernels
      NOTE:  At this time, there *IS* a BETA level IP_MASQ_FTP module               
             for PORT Forwarding FTP connections 2.2.x kernels which also supports  
             adding additional PORTFW FTP ports on the fly without the requirement  
             of unloading and reloading the IP_MASQ_FTP module and thus breaking    
             any existing FTP transfers.                                            
                                                                                    
   
  * Added a top level note about PORTFWed FTP support
   
  * Added a noted to the 2.0.x PORTFW'ed FTP example why users DON'T need to
    PORTFW port 20.
   
  * Updated the PORTFW section to also mention that users can use FTP proxy
    applications like the one from SuSe to support PORTFWed FTP-like
    functionality. Thanks to Stephen Graham for this one.
   
  * Updated the example for how to enable PORTFWed FTP to also include
    required configurations on how the ip_masq_ftp module is loaded for users
    who use multiple PORTs to contact multiple internal FTP servers. Thanks
    to Bob Britton for reminding me about this one.
   
  * Added a FAQ entry for users who have embedded ^Ms in their rc.firewall
    file
   
  * Expanded the FAQ entry talking about how MASQ is different from NAT and
    Proxy to include some informative URLs.
   
  * Updated the explanation of the MASQ MTU issue and described the two main
    explanations for the issue.
   
  * Clarified that the RFC, PPPoE should only require an MTU of 1492 though
    some ISPs require a setting of 1460. Because of this, I have updated the
    example to show an MTU of 1492.
   
  * Broke out the Windows 9x sections into Win95 and Win98 as they use
    different settings (DWORD vs. STRING). I also updated the sections to be
    clearer and the Registry backup methods have been updated.
   
  * Fixed a typo where the NT 4.0 Registry entries were backwards (Tcpip/
    Parameters vs. Parameters/Tcpip).
   
  * Fixed an issue where the WinNT entry should have been a DWORD and not a
    STRING.

  * Moved the IPROUTE2 URLs to the 2.2.x Kernel requirements section and also
    added a few more URLs as well.
   
  * Corrected the "intnet" varible in the stronger IPCHAINS ruleset to
    reflect the 192.168.0.0 network to be consistent with the rest of the
    example. Thanks to Ross Johnson for this one.
   
  * Added a new FAQ section for users asking about forwarding problems
    between multiple internal MASQed LANs.
   
  * Added a new FAQ section about users wanting to PORTFW all ports from
    multiple external IP addresses to internal ones. I also touched on users
    who were trying to PORTFW all ports on multiple IP ALIASed interfaces and
    also noted the Bridge+Firewall HOWTO for DSL and Cablemodem users who
    have multiple IPs in a non-routed environment.
   
  * Added Mandrake 7.1, Mandrake 7.2, and Slackware 7.1 to the supported list
   
  * Added Redhat 7.0 to the MASQ supported distros. Thanks to Eugene
    Goldstein for this one.

Changes from 1.85 to 1.90 - 07/03/00

  * Updated the URL for TrinityOS to reflect its newest layout
   
  * Caught a typo in the IPCHAINS rulesets where I was setting
    "ip_ip_always_defrag" instead of "ip_always_defrag"
   
  * The URL to Taro Fukunaga was invaild since it was using "mail:" instead
    of "mailto:"
   
  * Added some clarification to the "Masqing multiple internal interfaces"
    where some users didn't understand why eth0 was referenced multiple
    times.
   
  * Fixed another "space after the EXTIP variable" bug in the stronger
    IPCHAINS section. I guess I missed one.
   
  * In Test #7 of Section 5, I referred users to go back to step #4. That
    should have been step #6.
   
  * Updated the kernel versions that came with SuSe 5.2 and 6.0
   
  * Fixed a typo (or vs. of) in Section 7.2
   
  * Added Item #9 to the Testing MASQ section to refer users who are still
    haing MASQ problems to read the MTU entry in the FAQ
   
  * Improved the itemization in Section 5
   
  * Updated the IPCHAINS syntax to show the MASQ/FORWARD table. Before, it
    was valid to run "ipchains -F -L" but now only "ipchains -M -L" works.
   
  * Updated the LooseUDP documentation to reflect the new LooseUDP behavior
    in 2.2.16+ kernels. Before, it was always enabled, now, it defaults to
    OFF due to a possible MASQed UDP port scanning vulnerability. I updated
    the BASIC and SEMI-STRONG IPCHAINS rulesets to reflect this option.
   
  * Updated the recommended 2.2.x kernel to be 2.2.16+ since there is a TCP
    root exploit vulnerability on all lesser versions.
   
  * Added Redhat 6.2 to the MASQ supported list
   
  * Updated the link for Sonny Parlin's FWCONFIG to point to fBuilder.
   
  * Updated the various examples of IP addresses from 111.222.333.444 to be
    111.222.121.212 and within a valid IP address range
   
  * Updated the URL for the BETA H.323 MASQ module
   
  * Finally updated the MTU FAQ section to help out PPPoE DSL and Cablemodem
    users. Basically, Section 7.15 now reflects the fact that users can also
    change the MTU settings of all of their INTERNAL machines to solve the
    dreaded MASQ MTU issue.
   
  * Added a clarification to the PORTFW section that PORTFWed connections
    which work for EXTERNAL clients but will not work for INTERNAL clients.
    If you also need INTERNAL portfw, you will need to also implement the
    REDIR tool as well. I also noted that this issue is fixed in the 2.4.x
    kernels with Netfilter.
   
  * I also added a technical explanation from Juanjo to the end of the PORTFW
    section to why this senario doesn't work properly.
   
  * Updated all of the IPCHAINS URLs to point to Paul Rusty's new site at
    http://www.netfilter.org/ipchains/
   
  * Updated Paul Rustys email address
   
  * Added a new FAQ section for users whose connections remain idle for a
    long period of time and PORTFWed connections no longer work.
   
  * Updated all the URLs to the LDP that pointed to metalab.unc.edu to the
    new site of linuxdoc.org
   
  * Updated the Netfilter URLs to point to renamed HOWTOs, etc.
   
  * I also updated the status of the 2.4.x support to note that I *will* add
    full Netfilter support to this HOWTO and if the time comes, then split
    that support off into a different HOWTO.
   
  * Updated the 2.4.x Requirements section to reflect how NetFilter has
    changed compared to IPFWADM and IPCHAINS and gave a PROs/CONs list of new
    features and changes to old behaviors.
   
  * Added a TCP/IP math example to the "My MASQ connection is slow" FAQ entry
    to better explain what a user should expect performance wise.
   
  * Updated the HOWTO to reflect that newer versions of the "pump" DHCP
    client now can run scripts upon bringup, lease renew, etc.
   
  * Updated the PORTFWing of FTP to reflect that several users say they can
    successfully forward FTP traffic to internal machines without the need of
    a special ip_masq_ftp module. I have made the HOWTO reflect that users
    should try it without the modified module first and then move to the
    patch if required.
   

 

Changes from 1.82 to 1.85 - 05/29/00

  * Ambrose Au's name has been taken off the title page as David Ranch has
    been the primary maintainer for the HOWTO for over a year. Ambrose will
    still be involved with the WWW site though.
   
  * Deleted a stray SPACE in section 6.4
   
  * Re-ordered the compatible MASQ'ed OS section and added instructions for
    setting up a AS/400 system running on OS/400. Thanks to jaco@libero.it
    for the notes.
   
  * Added an additional PORFW-FTP patch URL for FTP access if HTTP access
    fails.
   
  * Updated the kernel versions for Redhat 5.1 & 6.1 in the FAQ
   
  * Added FloppyFW to the list of MASQ-enabled Linux distros
   
  * Fixed an issue in the Stronger IPFWADM rule set where there were spaces
    between "ppp_ip" and the "=".
   
  * In the kernel compiling section for 2.2.x kernels, I removed the
    reference to enable "CONFIG_IP_ALWAYS_DEFRAG". This option was removed
    from the compiling section and enabled by default with MASQ enabled in
    2.2.12.
   
  * Because of the above change in the kernel behavior, I added the enabling
    of ip_always_defrag to all the rc.firewall examples.
   
  * Updated the status of support for H.323. There are now ALPHA versions of
    modules to support H.323 on both 2.0.x and 2.2.x kernels.
   
  * Added Debian v2.2 to the supported MASQ distributions list
   
  * Fixed a long standing issue where the section that covered explict
    filtering of IP addresses for IPCHAINS had old IPFWADM syntax. I've also
    cleaned this section up a little and made it understandable.
   
  * Doh! Added Juan Ciarlante's URL to the important MASQ resources section.
    Man.. you guys need to make me more honest than this!!
   
  * Updated the HOWTO to reflect kernels 2.0.38 and 2.2.15
   
  * Reversed the order shown to compile kernels to show 2.2.x kernels first
    as 2.0.x is getting pretty old.
   
  * Updated the 2.2.x kernel compiling section to reflect the changed options
    for the latter 2.2.x kernels.
   
  * Added a a possible solution for users that fail to get past MASQ test #5.
   

 

Changes from 1.81 to 1.82 - 01/22/00

  * Reorganized and updated the "Masq is slow" FAQ section to include fixing
    Ethernet speed and duplex issues.
   
  * Added a link to Donald Becker's MII utilities for Ethernet NIC cards
   
  * Added a missing ")" for the 2.2.x section (previously fixed it only for
    the 2.0.x version) to the ICQ portfw script and changed the evaluation
    from -lt to -le
   
  * Added Caldera eServer v2.3 to the MASQ supported list
   
  * Added Mandrake 6.0, 6.1, 7.0 to the MASQ supported list
   
  * Added Slackware v7.0 to the MASQ supported list
   
  * Added Redhat 6.1 to the MASQ supported list
   
  * Added TurboLinux 4.0 Lite to the MASQ supported list
   
  * Added SuSe 6.3 to the MASQ supported list
   
  * Updated the recommended stable 2.2.x kernel to be anything newer than
    2.2.11
   
  * In section 3.3, the HOWTO forgot how to tell the user how to load the /
    etc/rc.d/rc.firewall upon each reboot. This has now been covered for
    Redhat (and Redhat-based distros) and Slackware.
   
  * Added clarification in the Windows WFWG v3.x and NT setup sections why
    users should NOT configure the DHCP, WINS, and Forwarding options.
   
  * Added a FAQ section on how to fix FTP problems with MASQed machines.
   
  * Fixed a typo in the Stronger firewall rulesets. The "extip" variabl
    cannot have the SPACE between the variable name and the "=" sign. Thanks
    to johnh@mdscomp.com for the sharp eye.
   
  * Updated the compatibly section: Mandrake 7.0 is based on 2.2.14 and
    TurboLinux v6.0 runs 2.2.12
   

 

Changes from 1.80 to 1.81 - 01/09/00

  * Updated the ICQ section to reflect that the new ICQ Masq module supports
    file transfer and real-time chat. The 2.0.x module still has those
    limitations.
   
  * Updated Steven E. Grevemeyer's email address. He is the maintainer of the
    IP Masq Applications page.
   
  * Fixed a few lines that were missing the work AREN'T for the "setsockopt"
    errors.
   
  * Updated a error the strong IPCHAINS ruleset where it was using the
    variable name "ppp_ip" instead of "extip".

  * Updated the Quake Module syntax to NOT use the "ports=" verbage
   

 

Changes from 1.79 to 1.80 - 12/26/99

  * Fixed a space typo when setting the "ppp_ip" address.
   
  * Fixed a typo in the simple IPCHAINS ruleset. "deny" to "DENY"
   
  * Updated the URLs for Bjorn's "modutils" for Linux
   
  * Added verbage about NetFilter and IPTables and gave URLs until it is
    added to this HOWTO or a different HOWTO.
   
  * Updated the simple /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall examples to notify users about
    the old Quake module bug.
   
  * Updated the STRONG IPFWADM /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall to clarify users about
    dynamic IP addresses (PPP & DHCP), newer DHCPCD syntax, and the old Quake
    module bug.
   
  * Updated the STRONG IPCHAINS /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall to ADD a missing
    section on dynamic IP addresses (PPP & DHCP) and the old Quake module
    bug.
   
  * Added a note in the "Applications that DO NOT work" section that there IS
    a beta module for Microsoft NetMeeting (H.323 based) v2.x on 2.0.x
    kernels. There is NO versions available for Netmeeting 3.x and/or 2.2.x
    kernels as of yet.
   

 

Changes from 1.78 to 1.79 - 10/21/99

    IPCHAINS fragmentation bug.
   
  * Updated all of the URLs pointing at Lee Nevo's old IP Masq Applications
    page to Seg's new page.
   

 

Changes from 1.76 to 1.77 - 7/26/99

  * Fixed a typo in the Port fowarding section that used "ipmasqadm ipportfw
    -C" instead of "ipmasqadm portfw -f"
   

 

Changes from 1.75 to 1.76 - 7/19/99

  * Updated the "ipfwadm: setsockopt failed: Protocol not available" message
    in the FAQ to be clearer instead of making the user hunt for the answer
    in the Forwarders section.
   
  * Fixed incorrect syntax in section 6.7 for IPMASQADM and "portfw"
   

 

Changes from 1.72 to 1.75 - 6/19/99

  * Fixed the quake module port setup order for the weak IPFWADM & IPCHAINS
    ruleset and the strong IPFWADM ruleset as well.

  * Updated the 2.2.x kernel step with a few clarifications on the
    Experiemental tag
   
  * Added Glen Lamb's name to the credits for the LooseUDP patch
   
  * Added a clarification on installing the LooseUDP patch that it should use
    "cat" for non-compressed patches.
   
  * Fixed a typo in the IPAUTO FAQ section
   
  * I had the DHCP client port numbers reversed for the IPFWADM and IPCHAINS
    rulesets. The order I had was if your Linux server was a DHCP SERVER.
   
  * Added explict /sbin path to all weak and strong ruleset examples.
   
  * Made some clarifications in the strong IPFWADM section regarding Dynamic
    IP addresses for PPP and DHCP users. I also noted that the strong
    rulesets should be re-run when PPP comes up or when a DHCP lease is
    renewed.
   
  * Added references in the 2.2.x requirements, updated the ICQ FAQ section,
    and added Andrew Deryabin to the credits section for his ICQ MASQ module.

    (Samba) through a MASQ server. I also added an URL to a Microsoft
    Knowledge based document for more details.
   
  * Added clarifications to the FAQ section that NO Debian distribution
    supports IP masq out of the box.
   
  * Updated the supported MASQ distributions in the FAQ section.

    an aliased interface.
   
  * Wow.. never caught this before but the "ppp-ip" variable in the strong
    ruleset section is an invalid variable name! It has been renamed to
    "ppp_ip"
   
  * In both the IPFWADM and IPCHAINS simple ruleset setup areas, I had a
    commented out section on enabling DHCP traffic. Problem is, it was below
    the final reject line! Doh! I moved both up a section.
   
  * In the simple IPCHAINS setup, the #d out line for DHCP users, I was using
    the IPFWADM "-W" command instead of IPCHAINS's "-i" parameter.
   
  * Added a little blurb to the Forwarders section the resolution to the
    famous "ipfwadm: setsockopt failed: Protocol not available" error. This
    also includes a little /proc test to let users confirm if IPPORTFW is
    enabled in the kernel. I also added this error to a FAQ section for
    simple searching.
   
  * Added a Strong IPCHAINS ruleset to the HOWTO
   
  * Added a FAQ section explaining the "kernel: ip_masq_new(proto=UDP): no

    rc.firewall rulesets.
   
  * Fixed the IPMASQADM forwards for ICQ
   
  * 1.72 - 4/14/99 - Dranch: Added a large list of Windows NAT/Proxy
    alternatives with rough pricing and URLs to the FAQ.
   
  * 1.71 - 4/13/99 - Dranch: Added IPCHAINS setups for multiple internal
    MASQed networks. Changed the ICQ setup to use ICQ's default 60 second
    timeout and changed IPFWADM/IPCHAINS timeout to 160 seconds. Updated the
    MASQ and MASQ-DEV email list and archive subscription instructions.
   
  * 1.70 - 3/30/99 - Dranch: Added two new FAQ sections that cover SMTP/POP-3
    timeout problems and how to masquerade multiple internal networks out
    onto different external IP addresses with IPROUTE2.
   
  * 1.65 - 3/29/99 - Dranch: Typo fixes, clarifications of required 2.2.x
    kernel options, added dynamic PPP IP address support to the strong
    firewall section, additional quake II module ports, noted that the
    LooseUDP patch is built into later 2.2.x kernels and its from Glenn Lamb
    and not Dan Kegel, added more game info in the compatibility section.
   
  * 1.62 - Dranch: Make the final first-draft changes to the doc and now
    announce it in the MASQ email list.
   
  * 1.61 - Dranch: Made editorial changes, cleaned things up and fixed some

    CuSeeme Mini-HOWTO since it is rarely used.
   
  * 1.55 - Dranch: Complete overhaul, feature and FAQ addition, and editing
    sweep of the v1.50 HOWTO. Completed the 2.2.x kernel and IPCHAINS
    configurations. Did a conversion from IPAUTOFW to IPPORTFW for the
    examples that applied. Added many URLs to various other documentation and
    utility sites. There are so many changes.. I hope everyone likes it.
    Final publishing of this new rev of the HOWTO to the LDP project won't
    happen until the doc is looked over and approved by the IP MASQ email
    list (then v2.00).
   
  * 1.50 - Ambrose: A serious update to the HOWTO and the initial addition of
    the 2.2.0 and IPCHAINS configurations.
   
  * 1.20 - Ambrose: One of the more recent HOWTO versions that solely dealt
    with < 2.0.x kernels and IPFWADM.
   
    
  IPMasquerading+Napster mini-HOWTO
  John E. Danner
  v1.6, 11 April 2000

  This mini-HOWTO present a way to allow users behind an IPMasq'd system
  to use Napster.

  For information about Napster, please see their website at Napster
  Homepage <http://www.napster.com/>

  1.  DISCLAIMER

  In order to allow Napster to work correctly, you will need to put a
  hole in the IP Masq'd system. This inherently presents potential
  security problems. Unfortunately I cannot accept responsibility for
  this hack. So if you do this, and you get burned because of it...not
  my fault. Great...now lets get into it...

  2.  INTRODUCTION

  After setting up a network for my roommates and I, the problem arose
  that were not able to use Napster because of the IPMasquerading I was
  doing. So I put some time into and came up with this solution to the
  problem. I hope it works for you like it did for me...but I can't
  promise anything.

  3.  BEFORE YOU BEGIN

  I have tested this solution with the following variables:


  1. Napster v2.0 Beta 5a (for Windows), visit Napster Homepage
     <http://www.napster.com/> to ensure you have the newest version.

  2. One external IP to the internet.

  3. Currently 6 systems behind the IPMasq'd machine, 4 using Napster.

  4. Using Linux kernel version 2.2.12-20 (RedHat v6.1 Distribution)

  5. IPMASQADM utility version 0.42, get it Here
     <http://juanjox.kernelnotes.org/>

  4.  PROCEDURE

  First off, ensure that you have the version (or newer) as listed above
  in the previous section. Also be sure they are installed correctly.


  1. Install Napster on the Windows client PC's

  2. After installation and Napster user setup, this version of Napster
     will begin "Finding Acceptable Local Data Port", after a short time
     an error will occur.  Note: If you have already installed napster
     v2.0 beta 5a, under the file menu select 'Properties.'

  3. At this point select the second option "I am not behind a firewall
     or I configured my firewall - Use TCP port:"

  4. Enter a unique number. Each computer that will be running Napster
     will need to use a different port. It may be easier to use the last
     number of the IP address. For example: if the computer's IP is
     192.168.1.2, then 6702 would be easiest to remember.  Note: make
     sure you don't pick ports for services that are running (i.e. 21,
     110, etc...see /etc/services for a listing)

  5. Repeats steps 1 - 4 for all systems that will be using Napster.

  6. Now login to your IPMasq'd system and modify a startup file of your
     choice (I choose to use /etc/rc.d/rc.local)

     The following lines pass the connection to the Napster clients running on the hosts behind your IPMasq'd system.
     (add them to the startup file - you'll need to one command for each host using Napster)

     /usr/sbin/ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 6702 -R 192.168.1.2 6702
     /usr/sbin/ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 6703 -R 192.168.1.3 6703
     /usr/sbin/ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 6704 -R 192.168.1.4 6704
     /usr/sbin/ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 6705 -R 192.168.1.5 6705

     Note: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX is the IP address of the Linux IPMasqing system (the Internet IP).


  Note: If you are having problems with IPMASQADM or IPMasquerading in
  general see the IPMASQ-HOWTO. This document is provided to help people
  who have their systems configured. The IPMASQ-HOWTO will get into a
  deeper discussion of port forwarding and IPMasq'd in general.


  5.  DYNAMIC IP AREA (Dial-up or DHCP)

  See this and the Procedure section if your IP address changes
  everytime you connect to the internet.

  Thanks to Peter Illmayer for the following submission to me: (This
  will work out best for those of you with dynamic IP's...)

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  IN debian, I created a forward file in /etc/ppp/ip-up.d and put in

  #!/bin/sh
  ppp_ip="`/sbin/ifconfig ppp0 | grep 'inet addr' | awk '{print $2}' | sed -e
  /usr/sbin/ipmasqadm portfw -f
  /usr/sbin/ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L ${ppp_ip} 6702 -R 192.168.0.2 6702

  This is in a 2.2.x kernel with ipmasqadm installed with the appropriate
  kernel modules compiled in.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------


  Charles J. Fisher pointed out that a similar script can be used if you
  are using DHCP, insert the following lines in a script that runs after
  you get your IP address.

  net_ip="`ifconfig eth0 | awk '/inet/ {sub(/addr:/,"",$2); print $2}'`"
  /usr/sbin/ipmasqadm portfw -f
  /usr/sbin/ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L ${net_ip} 6702 -R 192.168.1.2 6702


  Of course the more machines using Napster behind your IPMasq'd machine
  the more port forwards you need to do.

  6.  FINISHED PRODUCT

  This system will allow Napster to operate properly behind an IPMasq'd
  system.  Hopefully it works for you as well as it does for me! Please
  direct comments/suggestions/flames to   jed204@psu.edu

  7.  HOWTO MAINTENANCE

  This is the initial version of this document. Very rough. If the
  interest is out there and things changes, so will this document. If
  anyone else has a solution they think is better...please, all means,
  let me know and we can discuss what the best solution possible is.

This document explains how to use the term program to pierce a firewall from
the inside, even without root privileges.

Term is an old program that almost no one uses anymore, because the 7-bit
serial lines it is meant to cross are nowhere to be found anymore, and full
IP ppp access is dirt cheap.

2. Introduction

The term program is usually used to provide host-to-host services over a
modem or serial line. However, sometimes it is useful to establish a term
connection between two machines that communicate via telnet. The most
interesting example is connecting two hosts which are separated by ethernet
firewalls or SOCKS servers. Such firewalls provide facilities for
establishing a telnet connection through the firewall, typically by using the
SOCKS protocol, to allow inside machines to get connections out, and
requiring outside users to telnet first to a gateway machine which requires a
one-time password. These firewalls make it impossible to, for instance, have
X clients on an inside machine communicate with an X server on an outside
machine. But, by setting up a term connection, these restrictions can all be
bypassed quite conveniently, at the user level.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. The Basic Procedure

Setting up a term connection over a telnet substrate is a two-phase process.
First your usual telnet client is used to set up a telnet connection and log
in. Next, the telnet client is paused and control of the established telnet
connection is given to term.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Detailed Directions

First, from a machine inside the firewall, telnet to a target machine outside
the firewall and log in.

Unless you are under linux and will be using the proc filesystem (see below)
make sure your shell is an sh style shell. Ie if your default shell is a csh
variant, invoke telnet by:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|setenv SHELL /bin/sh; telnet machine.outside                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

After logging in, on the remote (outside) machine invoke the command:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|term -r -n off telnet                                                      |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Now break back to the telnet prompt on the local (inside) machine, using ^]
or whatever, and use the telnet shell escape command ! to invoke term:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|telnet> ! term -n on telnet >&3 <&3                                        |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

That's it!

If you have a variant telnet, you might have to use some other file
descriptor than 3; easy to check using strace. But three seems to work on all
bsd descendent telnet clients I've tried, under both SunOS 4.x and the usual
linux distributions.

Some telnet clients do not have the ! shell escape command. Eg the telnet
client distributed with Slackware 3.0 is one such client. The sources that
the Slackware telnet client is supposedly built from

ftp://ftp.cdrom.com:/pub/linux/slackware-3.0/source/n/tcpip/
NetKit-B-0.05.tar.gz

A simple solution is therefore to obtain these sources and recompile them.
This unfortunately is a task I have had no luck with. Plus, if you are
running from inside a SOCKS firewall, you will need a SOCKSified telnet
client anyway. To that end, I was able to compile a SOCKSified telnet client
from:

ftp://ftp.nec.com/pub/security/socks.cstc/socks.cstc.4.2.tar.gz

or, if you're outside the USA,

ftp://ftp.nec.com/pub/security/socks.cstc/export.socks.cstc.4.2.tar.gz

Alternatively, under linux kernels up to 1.2.13, you can pause the telnet
with ^]^z, figure out its pid, and invoke:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|term -n on -v /proc/&,t;telnetpid>/fd/3 telnet                             |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This doesn't work with kernels after 1.3.x, which closed some mysterious
security hole by preventing access to these fd's by processes other than the
owner process and its children.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Multiple Term Sockets

It is a good idea to give the term socket an explicit name. This is the
telnet; argument in the invocations of term above. Unless you have the
TERMSERVER environment variable set to telnet as appropriate, you invoke term
clients with the -t switch, e.g., trsh -t telnet.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. The <??/.term/termrc.telnet Init File

I have checked line clarity using linecheck over this medium. I expected it
to be completely transparent, but it is not. However, the only bad character
seems to be 255. The ??/.term/termrc.telnet I use (the .telnet is the name of
the term connection, see above) contains:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|baudrate off                                                               |
|escape 255                                                                 |
|ignore 255                                                                 |
|timeout 600                                                                |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Perhaps it could be improved by diddling, I am getting a throughput of only
about 30k cps over a long-haul connection through a slow firewall. Ftp can
move about 100k cps over the same route. A realistic baudrate might avoid
some timeouts.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Direction

Obviously, if you are starting from outside the firewall and zitching in
using a SecureID card or something, you will want to reverse the roles of the
remote vs local servers given above. (If you don't understand what this
means, perhaps you are not familiar enough with term to use the trick
described in this file responsibly.)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Security

This is not much more of a vulnerability than the current possibility of
having a telnet connection hijacked on an unsecured outside machine. The
primary additional risk comes from people being able to use the term socket
you set up without you even being aware of it. So be careful out there.
(Personally, I do this with an outside machine I know to be pretty secure,
namely a linux laptop I maintain myself that does not accept any incoming
connections.)

Another possibility is to add

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|socket off                                                                 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

to the remote ??/.term/termrc.telnet file, or

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|add "-u off"                                                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

to the invocation of term. This prevents the socket from being hijacked from
the remote end, with only a minor loss of functionality.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Telnet Mode

Be sure the remote telnetd is not in some nasty seven-bit mode. Or if it is,
you have to tell term about it when you invoke term, by adding the -a switch
at both ends. (I sometimes use >^] telnet> set outbin or set bin, or invoke
telnet with a -8 switch to put the connection into eight-bit mode.)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. Bugs and Term Wish List

The linecheck program has some problems checking telnet connections
sometimes. This is sometimes because it doesn't check the return code of the
read() call it makes. For network connections, this call to read() can return
-1 with an EINTR (interrupted) or EAGAIN (try again) error code. Obviously
this should be checked for.

There are a number of features that could ease the use of term over telnet.
These primarily relate to an assumption that influenced the design of term,
namely that the connection is low bandwidth, low latency, and somewhat noisy.

A telnet connection is in general high bandwidth, high latency, and error
free. This means that the connection could be better utilized if (a) the
maximum window size was raised, well above the limit imposed by term's
N_PACKETS/2=16, (b) there was an option to turn off sending and checking
packet checksums, and (c) larger packets were permitted when appropriate.

Also, to enhance security, it would be nice to have a term option to log all
connections through the socket it monitors to a log file, or to stderr, or
both. This would allow one to see if one's term connection is being subverted
by nasty hackers on the outside insecure machine.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

11. Tricks That Do Not Seem to Work

Some telnet clients and servers agree to encrypt their communications, to
prevent eavesdropping on the connection. Unfortunately, the hack used above
(using the network connection that the telnet client has set up while the
telnet client is idle) won't work in that case. Instead, one really must go
through the telnet client itself, so it can do its encryption. It seems like
that requires a simple hack to the telnet client itself, to add a command
that runs a process with its stdin and stdout are connected to the live
telnet connection. This would also be useful for various bots, so perhaps
someone has already hacked it up.

A vaguely related trick is to SOCKSify one's Term library. Details, including
patches to SOCKS, are available from Steven Danz danz@wv.mentorg.com.
