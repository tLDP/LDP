Internet is not described as a network of any single kind. It can be construed 
as a large set of heterogenous networks that support a certain set of protocols 
(TCP/IP) and provide certain common services. A good way to learn about the 
Internet is to use the Internet!

term Intranet refers to the application of Internet technologies
inside an organisation mainly for the purpose of distributing and
making available information inside the company. Internet and Intranet
