  8.5.  IP aliasing

  This feature of the Linux kernel provides the possibility of setting
  multiple network addresses on the same low-level network device driver
  (e.g two IP addresses in one Ethernet card). It is typically used for
  services that act differently based on the address they listen on
  (e.g. "multihosting" or "virtual domains" or "virtual hosting
  services".

This is a cookbook recipe on how to set up and run IP aliasing on a Linux box
and how to set up the machine to receive e-mail on the aliased IP addresses.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. My Setup

  * IP Alias is standard in kernels 2.0.x and 2.2.x, and available as a
    compile-time option in 2.4.x (IP Alias has been deprecated in 2.4.x and
    replaced by a more powerful firewalling mechanism.)
   
  * IP Alias compiled as a loadable module. You would have indicated in the
    "make config" command to make your kernel, that you want the IP Masq to
    be compiled as a (M)odule. Check the Modules HOW-TO (if that exists) or
    check the info in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/modules.txt.
   
  * I have to support 2 additional IPs over and above the IP already
    allocated to me.
   
  * A D-Link DE620 pocket adapter (not important, works with any Linux
    supported network adapter).
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Commands

 1. Load the IP Alias module (you can skip this step if you compiled the
    module into the kernel):
    /sbin/insmod /lib/modules/`uname -r`/ipv4/ip_alias.o             
   
 2. Setup the loopback, eth0, and all the IP addresses beginning with the
    main IP address for the eth0 interface:
    /sbin/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1                                      
    /sbin/ifconfig eth0 up                                           
    /sbin/ifconfig eth0 172.16.3.1                                   
    /sbin/ifconfig eth0:0 172.16.3.10                                
    /sbin/ifconfig eth0:1 172.16.3.100                               
   
    172.16.3.1 is the main IP address, while .10 and .100 are the aliases.
    The magic is the eth0:x where x=0,1,2,...n for the different IP
    addresses. The main IP address does not need to be aliased.
   
 3. Setup the routes. First route the loopback, then the net, and finally,
    the various IP addresses starting with the default (originally allocated)
    one:
    /sbin/route add -net 127.0.0.0                                   
    /sbin/route add -net 172.16.3.0 dev eth0                         
    /sbin/route add -host 172.16.3.1 dev eth0                        
    /sbin/route add -host 172.16.3.10 dev eth0:0                     
    /sbin/route add -host 172.16.3.100 dev eth0:1                    
    /sbin/route add default gw 172.16.3.200                          
   
    That's it.
   

In the example IP address above, I am using the Private IP addresses (RFC
1918) for illustrative purposes. Substitute them with your own official or
private IP addresses.

The example shows only 3 IP addresses. The max is defined to be 256 in /usr/
include/linux/net_alias.h. 256 IP addresses on ONE card is a lot :-)!

Here's what my /sbin/ifconfig looks like:

                    TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0                     

And /proc/net/aliases:

eth0:1           2      172.16.3.100                                         

And /proc/net/alias_types:
type    name            n_attach

Of course, the stuff in /proc/net was created by the ifconfig command and not
by hand!

3. Troubleshooting: Questions and Answers

3.1. Question: How can I keep the settings through a reboot?

Answer: Whether you are using BSD-style or SysV-style (Redhat?? for example) 
init, you can always include it in /etc/rc.d/rc.local. Here's what I have on
my SysV init system (Redhat?? 3.0.3 and 4.0):

My /etc/rc.d/rc.local: (edited to show the relevant portions)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2. Question: How do I set up the IP aliased machine to receive e-mail on
the various aliased IP addresses (on a machine using sendmail)?

Answer: Create (if it doesn't already exist) a file called, /etc/
mynames.cw,for example. The file does not have to be this exact name nor in
the /etc directory.

In that file, place the official domain names of the aliased IP addresses. If
these aliased IP addresses do not have a domain name, then you can place the
IP address itself.

The /etc/mynames.cw might look like this:
# /etc/mynames.cw - include all aliases for your machine here; # is a comment 
domain.one.net                                                                
domain.two.com                                                                
domain.three.org                                                              
4.5.6.7                                                                       

In your sendmail.cf file, where it defines a file class macro Fw, add the
following:
                                                                             
##################                                                           
#   local info   #                                                           
##################                                                           
                                                                             
                                                                             
# file containing names of hosts for which we receive email                  
Fw/etc/mynames.cw                                                            
                                                                             

That should do it. Test out the new setting by invoking sendmail in test
mode. The following is an example:
ganymede$ /usr/lib/sendmail -bt
