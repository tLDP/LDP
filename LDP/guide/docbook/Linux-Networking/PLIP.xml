<title>PLIP</title>

<para>
PLIP (Parallel Line IP), is like SLIP, in that it is used for
providing a point to point network connection between two machines,
except that it is designed to use the parallel printer ports on your
machine instead of the serial ports (a cabling diagram in included in
the cabling diagram section later in this document). Because it is
possible to transfer more than one bit at a time with a parallel port,
it is possible to attain higher speeds with the plip interface than
with a standard serial device. In addition, even the simplest of
parallel ports, printer ports, can be used in lieu of you having to
purchase comparatively expensive 16550AFN UART's for your serial
ports. PLIP uses a lot of CPU compared to a serial link and is most
certainly not a good option if you can obtain some cheap ethernet
cards, but it will work when nothing else is available and will work
quite well. You should expect a data transfer rate of about 20
kilobytes per second when a link is running well.

7.2.  PLIP for Linux-2.0

<para>
PLIP device names are `plip0', `plip1 and plip2.
</para>

<para>
<screen>
  Kernel Compile Options:

             Network device support  --->
                 <*> PLIP (parallel port) support
</screen>
</para>

<para>
The PLIP device drivers competes with the parallel device driver for
the parallel port hardware. If you wish to use both drivers then you
should compile them both as modules to ensure that you are able to
select which port you want to use for PLIP and which ports you want
for the printer driver. Refer to the ``Modules mini-HOWTO'' for more
information on kernel module configuration.
</para>

<para>
Please note that some laptops use chipsets that will not work with
PLIP because they do not allow some combinations of signals that PLIP
relies on, that printers don't use.
</para>

<para>
The Linux plip interface is compatible with the Crynwyr Packet Driver
PLIP and this will mean that you can connect your Linux machine to a
DOS machine running any other sort of tcp/ip software via plip.
</para>

<para>
In the 2.0.* series kernel the plip devices are mapped to i/o port and
IRQ as follows:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
        device  i/o     IRQ
        ------  -----   ---
        plip0   0x3bc   5
        plip1   0x378   7
        plip2   0x278   2
</screen>
</para>

<para>
If your parallel ports don't match any of the above combinations then
you can change the IRQ of a port using the ifconfig command using the
`irq' parameter (be sure to enable IRQ's on your printer ports in your
ROM BIOS if it supports this option). As an alternative, you can
specify ``io='' annd ``irq='' options on the insmod command line, if
you use modules. For example:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
        root# insmod plip.o io=0x288 irq=5
</screen>
</para>

<para>
PLIP operation is controlled by two timeouts, whose default values are
probably ok in most cases. You will probably need to increase them if
you have an especially slow computer, in which case the timers to
increase are actually on the other computer.  A program called
plipconfig exists that allows you to change these timer settings
without recompiling your kernel. It is supplied with many Linux
distributions.
</para>

<para>
To configure a plip interface, you will need to invoke the following
commands (or add them to your initialization scripts):
</para>

<para>
<screen>
        root# /sbin/ifconfig plip1 localplip pointopoint remoteplip
        root# /sbin/route add remoteplip plip1
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Here, the port being used is the one at I/O address 0x378; localplip
amd remoteplip are the names or IP addresses used over the PLIP cable.
I personally keep them in my /etc/hosts database:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
        # plip entries
        192.168.3.1   localplip
        192.168.3.2   remoteplip
</screen>
</para>

<para>
The pointopoint parameter has the same meaning as for SLIP, in that it
specifies the address of the machine at the other end of the link.
</para>

<para>
In almost all respects you can treat a plip interface as though it
were a SLIP interface, except that neither dip nor slattach need be,
nor can be, used.
</para>

<para>
Further information on PLIP may be obtained from the ``PLIP mini-
HOWTO''.

7.3.  PLIP for Linux-2.2

<para>
During development of the 2.1 kernel versions, support for the
parallel port was changed to a better setup.
</para>

<para>
<screen>
  Kernel Compile Options:

             General setup  --->
                 [*] Parallel port support
             Network device support  --->
                 <*> PLIP (parallel port) support
</screen>
</para>

<para>
The new code for PLIP behaves like the old one (use the same ifconfig
and route commands as in the previous section, but initialization of
the device is different due to the advanced parallel port support.
</para>

<para>
The ``first'' PLIP device is always called ``plip0'', where first is
the first device detected by the system, similarly to what happens for
Ethernet devices. The actual parallel port being used is one of the
available ports, as shown in /proc/parport. For example, if you have
only one parallel port, you'll only have a directory called
/proc/parport/0.
</para>

<para>
If your kernel didn't detect the IRQ number used by your port,
``insmod plip'' will fail; in this case just write the right number to
/proc/parport/0/irq and reinvoke insmod.
</para>

<para>
Complete information about parallel port management is available in
the file Documentation/parport.txt, part of your kernel sources.
</para>

·  PLIP information can be found in The Network Administrator Guide
   <http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/LDP/nag/nag.html>

PLIP allows the cheap connection of two machines.
It uses a parallel port and a special cable, achieving speeds of
10kBps to 20kBps.
