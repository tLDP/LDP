Trivial File Transfer Protocol TFTP is a bare-bones protocol used by
devices that boot from the network. It is runs on top of UDP, so it
doesn&apos;t require a real TCP/IP stack. Misunderstanding: Many people
describe TFTP as simply a trivial version of FTP without authentication.
This misses the point. The purpose of TFTP is not to reduce the complexity
of file transfer, but to reduce the complexity of the underlying TCP/IP
stack so that it can fit inside boot ROMs. Key point: TFTP is almost
always used with BOOTP. BOOTP first configures the device, then TFTP
transfers the boot image named by BOOTP which is then used to boot the
device. Key point: Many systems come with unnecessary TFTP servers. Many
TFTP servers have bugs, like the backtracking problem or buffer overflows.
As a consequence, many systems can be exploited with TFTP even though
virtually nobody really uses it. Key point: A TFTP file transfer client
is built into many operating systems (UNIX, Windows, etc.). These clients
are often used to download rootkits when being broken into. Therefore,
removing the TFTP client should be part of your hardening procedure.
For further details on the TFTP protocol please see RFC's 1350, 1782,
1783, 1784, and 1785.

Most likely, you'll interface with the TFTP protocol using the TFTP command
line client, 'tftp', which allows users to transfer files to and from a
remote machine. The remote host may be specified on the command line, in
which case tftp uses host as the default host for future transfers.

Setting up TFTP is almost as easy as DHCP.
First install from the rpm package:
<screen>
# rpm -ihv tftp-server-*.rpm                                                 
</screen>
</para>                                                                            

<para>
Create a directory for the files:
<screen>
# mkdir /tftpboot                                                            
# chown nobody:nobody /tftpboot                                              
</screen>
</para>

<para>
The directory /tftpboot is owned by user nobody, because this is the default
user id set up by tftpd to access the files. Edit the file /etc/xinetd.d/tftp
to look like the following:
</para>
	
<para>
<screen>
service tftp                                                                 
{                                                                            
        socket_type     = dgram                                              
        protocol        = udp                                                
        wait            = yes                                                
        user            = root                                               
        server          = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd                                 
        server_args     = -c -s /tftpboot                                    
        disable         = no                                                 
        per_source      = 11                                                 
        cps             = 100 2                                              
}                                                                            
</screen>
</para>

<para>
The changes from the default file are the parameter disable = no (to enable
the service) and the server argument -c. This argument allows for the
creation of files, which is necessary if you want to save boot or disk
images. You may want to make TFTP read only in normal operation.
</para>

<para>
Then reload xinetd:
<screen>
/etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd reload
</screen>
</para>

<para>
You can use the tftp command, available from the tftp (client) rpm package,
to test the server. At the tftp prompt, you can issue the commands put and 
get.
