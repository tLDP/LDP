 10.3.  Redundant networking

  IP Address Takeover (IPAT). When a network adapter card fails, its IP
  address should be taken by a working network card in the same node or
  in another node. MAC Address Takeover: when an IP takeover occurs, it
  should be made sure that all the nodes in the network update their ARP
  caches (the mapping between IP and MAC addresses).
