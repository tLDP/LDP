<para>
X.25 is a circuit based protocol developed in the 1970s for packet switching
by the C.C.I.T.T. (a standards body recognized by Telecommunications
companies in most parts of the world), allowing customers to share access to
a PDN (Public Data Network). These networks, such as Sprintnet and Tymnet,
were the most practical way to connect large companies at the time,
and are still used by some companies. PDNs are networks that have local
dial-up access points in cities throughout the country and use dedicated lines
to network between these cities. Companies would dial up in two locations to
connect their computers.

<para>
Computers, routers, or other devices that access a PDN using the X.25
protocols are called data terminal equipment, or DTEs. DTEs without built-in
support for X.25 is a protocol with a relatively high overhead, since it
provides error control and accounting for users of the network.

The X.25 protocol supports speeds up to 64 Kbps. This makes it impractical for
many networks, but it is an inexpensive alternative for low-bandwidth
applications. X,25 is a protocol with a relatively high overhead, since it
provides error control and accouting for users of the network.

An implementation of X.25 and LAPB are being worked on and recent
2.1.* kernels include the work in progress. Jonathon Naylor
jsn@cs.nott.ac.uk is leading the development and a
mailing list has been established to discuss Linux X.25 related
matters.  To subscribe send a message to: majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu
with the text "subscribe linux-x25" in the body of the message.
Early versions of the configuration tools may be obtained from
Jonathon's ftp site at ftp.cs.nott.ac.uk.
