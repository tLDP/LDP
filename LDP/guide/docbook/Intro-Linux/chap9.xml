<sect1 id="sect_09_01"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>Although Linux is one of the safest operating systems in existence, and even if it is designed to keep on going, data can get lost.  Data loss is most often the consequence of user errors, but occasionally a system fault, such as a power failure, is the cause, so it's always a good idea to keep an extra copy of sensitive and/or important data.</para>
<sect2 id="sect_09_01_01"><title>Preparing your data</title>
<sect3 id="sect_09_01_01_01"><title>Archiving with tar</title>
<para>In most cases, we will first collect all the data to back up in a single archive file, which we will compress later on.  The process of archiving involves concatenating all listed files and taking out unnecessary blanks.  In Linux, this is commonly done with the <command>tar</command> command.  <command>tar</command> was originally designed to archive data on tapes, but it can also make archives, known as <emphasis>tarballs</emphasis>.</para>
<para><command>tar</command> has many options, the most important ones are cited below:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><option>-v</option>: verbose</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><option>-t</option>: test, shows content of a tarball</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><option>-x</option>: extract archive</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><option>-c</option>: create archive</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><option>-f</option> <filename>archivedevice</filename>: use <filename>archivedevice</filename> as source/destination for the tarball, the device defaults to the first tape device (usually <filename>/dev/st0</filename> or something similar)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><option>-j</option>: filter through <command>bzip2</command>, see <xref linkend="sect_09_01_01_02" /></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>It is common to leave out the dash-prefix with <command>tar</command> options, as you can see from the examples below.</para>
<note><title>Use GNU tar for compatibility</title>
<para>The archives made with a proprietary <command>tar</command> version on one system, may be incompatible with <command>tar</command> on another proprietary system.  This may cause much headaches, such as if the archive needs to be recovered on a system that doesn't exist anymore.  Use the GNU <command>tar</command> version on all systems to prevent your system admin from bursting into tears.  Linux always uses GNU tar.  When working on other UNIX machines, enter <command>tar <option>--help</option></command> to find out which version you are using.  Contact your system admin if you don't see the word GNU somewhere.</para></note>
<para>In the example below, an archive is created and unpacked.</para>

<prompt>gaby:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls *.jpg</command>
me+tux.jpg  nimf.jpg
</screen>
<para>This example also illustrates the difference between a tarred directory and a bunch of tarred files.  It is advisable to only compress directories, so files don't get spread all over when unpacking the tarball (which may be on another system, where you may not know which files where already there and which are the ones from the archive).</para>
<para>When a tape drive is connected to your machine and configured by your system administrator, the file names ending in <filename>.tar</filename> are replaced with the tape device name, for example:</para>
<para><command>tar <option>cvf</option> <filename>/dev/tape</filename> <filename>mail/</filename></command></para>
<para>The directory <filename>mail</filename> and all the files it contains are compressed into a file that is written on the tape immediately.  A content listing is displayed because we used the verbose option.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_09_01_01_02"><title>Incremental backups with tar</title>
<para>The <command>tar</command> tool supports the creation of incremental backups, using the <option>-N</option> option.  With this option, you can specify a date, and <command>tar</command> will check modification time of all specified files against this date.  If files are changed more recent than date, they will be included in the backup.  The example below uses the timestamp on a previous archive as the date value.  First, the initial archive is created and the timestamp on the initial backup file is shown.  Then a new file is created, upon which we take a new backup, containing only this new file:</para>

<prompt>jimmy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>tar xvf incremental1-javaproggies.tar</command>

</screen>
<para>Standard errors are redirected to <filename>/dev/null</filename>.  If you don't do this, <command>tar</command> will print a message for each unchanged file, telling you it won't be dumped.</para> 
<para>This way of working has the disadvantage that it looks at timestamps on files.  Say that you download an archive into the directory containing your backups, and the archive contains files that have been created two years ago.  When checking the timestamps of those files against the timestamp on the initial archive, the new files will actually seem old to <command>tar</command>, and will not be included in an incremental backup made using the <option>-N</option> option.</para>
<para>A better choice would be the <option>-g</option> option, which will create a list of files to backup.  When making incremental backups, files are checked against this list.  This is how it works:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>jimmy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>tar cvpf work-20030121.tar -g snapshot-20030121 work/</command>
work/
work/file1
work/file2
work/file3

<prompt>jimmy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>file snapshot-20030121</command>
snapshot-20030121: ASCII text
</screen>
<para>The next day, user <emphasis>jimmy</emphasis> works on <filename>file3</filename> a bit more, and creates <filename>file4</filename>.  At the end of the day, he makes a new backup:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>jimmy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>tar cvpf work-20030122.tar -g snapshot-20030121 work/</command>
work/
work/file3
work/file4
</screen>
<para>These are some very simple examples, but you could also use this kind of command in a cronjob (see <xref linkend="sect_04_04_04" />), which specifies for instance a snapshot file for the weekly backup and one for the daily backup.  Snapshot files should be replaced when taking full backups, in that case.</para>
<para>More information can be found in the <command>tar</command> documentation.</para>
<tip><title>The real stuff</title>
<para>As you could probably notice, <command>tar</command> is OK when we are talking about a simple directory, a set of files that belongs together.  There are tools that are easier to manage, however, when you want to archive entire partitions or disks or larger projects.  We just explain about <command>tar</command> here because it is a very popular tool for distributing archives.  It will happen quite often that you need to install a software that comes in a so-called <quote>compressed tar ball</quote>.  See <xref linkend="sect_09_03" /> for an easier way to perform regular backups.</para>

<sect3 id="sect_09_01_01_03"><title>Compressing and unpacking with <command>gzip</command> or <command>bzip2</command></title>
<para>
Data, including tarballs, can be compressed using zip tools.  The <command>gzip</command> command will add the suffix .gz to the file name and remove the original file.
</para>

<para>Uncompress gzipped files with the <option>-d</option> option.</para>
<para><command>bzip2</command> works in a similar way, but uses an improved compression algorithm, thus creating smaller files.  See the <command>bzip2</command> info pages for more.</para>

<para>Linux software packages are often distributed in a gzipped tarball.  The sensible thing to do after unpacking that kind of archives is find the <filename>README</filename> and read it.  It will generally contain guidelines to installing the package.</para>

<sect3 id="sect_09_01_01_04"><title>Java archives</title>
<para>The GNU project provides us with the <command>jar</command> tool for creating Java archives.  It is a Java application that combines multiple files into a single JAR archive file.  While also being a general purpose archiving and compression tool, based on ZIP and the ZLIB compression format, <command>jar</command> was mainly designed to facilitate the packing of Java code, applets and/or applications in a single file.  When combined in a single archive, the components of a Java application, can be downloaded much faster.</para>
<para>Unlike <command>tar</command>, <command>jar</command> compresses by default, independent from other tools - because it is basically the Java version of <command>zip</command>.  In addition, it allows individual entries in an archive to be signed by the author, so that origins can be authenticated.</para>
<para>The syntax is almost identical as for the <command>tar</command> command, we refer to <command>info <parameter>jar</parameter></command> for specific differences.</para>
<note><title>tar, jar and symbolic links</title>
<para>One noteworthy feature not really mentioned in the standard documentation is that <command>jar</command> will follow symbolic links.  Data to which these links are pointing will be included in the archive.  The default in <command>tar</command> is to only backup the symbolic link, but this behavior can be changed using the <option>-h</option> to <command>tar</command>.</para>

<para>On most Linux systems, users have access to the floppy disk device.  The name of the device may vary depending on the size and number of floppy drives, contact your system admin if you are unsure.  On sensibly administered systems, there will likely be a link <filename>/dev/floppy</filename> pointing to the right device, probably <filename>/dev/fd0</filename> (the auto-detecting floppy device) or <filename>/dev/fd0H1440</filename> (set for 1,44MB floppies).</para>

<sect2 id="sect_09_02_03"><title>Backups on/from jazz drives, USB devices and such</title>
<para>These devices are usually mounted into the file system.  After the mount procedure, they are accessed as normal directories, so you can use the standard commands for manipulating files.</para>
<para>In the example below, images are copied from a USB camera to the hard disk:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>robin:~&gt;</prompt> <command>mount <filename>/mnt/camera</filename></command>

<prompt>robin:~&gt;</prompt> <command>mount | grep <parameter>camera</parameter></command>
/dev/sda1 on /mnt/camera type vfat (rw,nosuid,nodev)
</screen>
<para>If the camera is the only USB storage device that you ever connect to your system, this is safe.  But keep in mind that USB devices are assigned entries in <filename>/dev</filename> as they are connected to the system.  Thus, if you first connect a USB stick to your system, it will be on the <filename>/dev/sda</filename> entry, and if you connect your camera after that, it will be assigned to <filename>/dev/sdb</filename> - provided that you do not have any SCSI disks, which are also on <filename>/dev/sd*</filename>.  On newer systems, since kernel 2.6, a hotplug system called HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) ensures that users don't have to deal with this burden.  If you want to check where your device is, type <command>dmesg</command> after inserting it.</para>
<para>You can now copy the files:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>robin:~&gt;</prompt> <command>cp -R /mnt/camera/* images/</command>

<prompt>robin:~&gt;</prompt> <command>umount /mnt/camera</command>
</screen>
<para>Likewise, a jazz drive may be mounted on <filename>/mnt/jazz</filename>.</para>
<para>Appropriate lines should be added in <filename>/etc/modules.conf</filename> and <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> to make this work.  Refer to specific hardware HOWTOs for more information.</para> 
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_09_02_04"><title>Backing up data using a tape device</title>
<para>This is done using <command>tar</command> (see above).  The <command>mt</command> tool is used for controlling the magnetic tape device, like <filename>/dev/st0</filename>.  Entire books have been written about tape backup, therefore, refer to our reading-list in <xref linkend="app2" /> for more information.  Keep in mind that databases might need other backup procedures because of their architecture.</para>
<para>The appropriate backup commands are usually put in one of the <emphasis>cron</emphasis> directories in order to have them executed on a regular basis.

<sect1 id="sect_09_03"><title>Using rsync</title>
<sect2 id="sect_09_03_01"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>The <command>rsync</command> program is a fast and flexible tool for remote backup.  It is common on UNIX and UNIX-like systems, easy to configure and use in scripts.  While the <emphasis>r</emphasis> in <command>rsync</command> stands for <quote>remote</quote>, you do not need to take this all too literally.  Your <quote>remote</quote> device might just as well be a USB storage device or another partition on your hard disk, you do not need to have two separated machines.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_09_03_02"><title>An example: rsync to a USB storage device</title>
<para>As discussed in <xref linkend="sect_03_01_02_03" />, we will first have to mount the device.  This is done as <emphasis>root</emphasis>:</para>
