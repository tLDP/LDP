<sect1 id="sect_11_01"><title>Audio Basics</title>
<sect2 id="sect_11_01_01"><title>Installation</title>
<para>Most likely, your system is already installed with audio drivers and the configuration was done at installation time.  Likewise, should you ever need to replace your audio hardware, most systems provide tools that allow easy setup and configuration of the device.  Most currently available 
 plug-and-play sound cards should be recognized automatically.  If you can hear the samples that are played during configuration, just click <guibutton>OK</guibutton> 
and everything will be set up for you.</para>
<para>If your card is not detected automatically, you may be presented with a li
st of sound cards and/or of sound card properties from which to choose.  After t
hat, you will have to provide the correct I/O port, IRQ and DMA settings.  Infor
mation about these settings can be found in your sound card documentation.  If y
ou are on a dual boot system with MS Windows, this information can be found in t
he Windows Control Panel as well.</para>
<note><title>If automatic sound card detection fails</title>
<para>
If your soundcard is not supported by default, you will need to apply other tech
niques.  These are described in the <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Sound-HOWTO/index.html">Linux Sound HOWTO</ulink>.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_11_01_02"><title>Drivers and Architecture</title>
<para>There are generally two types of sound architecture: the older Open Sound System or OSS, which works with every UNIX-like system, and the newer Advanced Linux Sound Architecture or ALSA, that has better support for Linux, as the name indicates.  ALSA also has more features and allows for faster driver development.  We will focus here on the ALSA system.</para>

<para>Today, almost all mainstream audio chipsets are supported.  Only some high-end professional solutions and some cards developed by manufacturers refusing to document their chipset specifications are unsupported.  An overview of supported devices can be found on the ALSA site at <xref linked="http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/index.php?vendor=All#matrix" />.</para>
<para>Configuring systems installed with ALSA is done using the <command>alsaconf</command> tool.  Additionally, distributions usually provide their own tools for configuring the sound card; these tools might even integrate the old and the new way of handling sound devices.</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="sect_11_02"><title>Sound and video playing</title>
<sect2 id="sect_11_02_01"><title>CD playing and copying</title>
<para>The <emphasis>cdp</emphasis> package comes with most distributions and pro
vides <command>cdp</command> or <command>cdplay</command>, a text-based CD playe
r.  Desktop managers usually include a graphical tool, such as the <command>gnom
e-cd</command> player in Gnome, that can be started from a menu.</para>
<para>Be sure to understand the difference between an audio CD and a data CD.  Y
ou do not have to mount an audio CD into the file system in order to listen to i
t.  This is because the data on such a CD are not Linux file system data; they a
re accessed and sent to the audio output channel directly, using a CD player pro
gram.  If your CD is a data CD containing <filename>.mp3</filename> files, you w
ill first need to mount it into the file system, and then use one of the program
s that we discuss below in order to play the music.  How to mount CDs into the f
ile system is explained in <xref linkend="sect_07_06_05" />.</para>
<para>The <command>cdparanoia</command> tool from the package with the same name
 reads audio directly as data from the CD, without analog conversions, and write
 s data to a file or pipe in different formats, of which <filename>.wav</filename> is probably the most popular.  Various tools for conversion to other formats, formats,  
 such as <filename>.mp3</filename>, come with most distributions or are downloadable as separate packages.  The GNU project provides several CD playing, ripping and encoding tools, database managers; see the <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/directory/audio/">Free Software Directory, Audio section</ulink> for detailed information.</para>
 <para>Audio-CD creation is eased, among many others, with the <command>kaudiocreator</command> tool from the KDE suite.  It comes with clear information from the KDE Help Center and is included on systems that have the <application>kdemultimedia</application> package installed.</para>

 <para>CD burning is covered in general in <xref linkend="sect_09_02_02" />.</para>
 </sect2>
 <sect2 id="sect_11_02_02"><title>Playing music files</title>
 <sect3 id="sect_11_02_02_01"><title>mp3 files</title>
 <para>The popular <filename>.mp3</filename> format is widely supported on Linux 
 machines.  Most distributions include multiple programs that can play these file
 s.  Among many other applications, <application>XMMS</application>, which is pre
 sented in the screenshot below, is one of the most wide-spread, partially becaus
 e it has the same look and feel as the Windows tool.</para>

 <para>Also very popular for playing music are <application>AmaroK</application>, a KDE application that is steadily gaining popularity, and <application>MPlayer</application>, which can also play movies.</para>

  <note><title>Restrictions</title>
  <para>Some distributions don't allow you to play MP3's without modifying your configuration, this is due to license restrictions on the MP3 tools.  You might need to install extra software to be able to play your music.</para>
  </note>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_11_02_02_02"><title>Other formats</title>
<para>An (incomplete) overview of other common sound playing and manipulating so
ftware:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Ogg Vorbis: Free audio format: see <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/directory/audio/ogg/">the GNU audio directory</ulink> for tools - they might be included in your distribution as well.  The format was developed because MP3 is patented.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Real audio and video: <command>realplay</command> from <ulink url="http://real.com">RealNetworks</ulink>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>SoX or Sound eXchange: actually a sound converter, comes with th
e <command>play</command> program.  Plays <filename>.wav</filename>, <filename>.
ogg</filename> and various other formats, including raw binary formats.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Playmidi: a MIDI player, see the GNU directory.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>AlsaPlayer: from the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture project, 
see the <ulink url="http://www.alsaplayer.org">AlsaPlayer web site</ulink>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>mplayer</command>: plays just about anything, including
 mp3 files.  More info on the <ulink url="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">MPlayerHQ we
 bsite</ulink>.</para></listitem>
 <listitem><para><command>hxplay</command>: supports RealAudio and RealVideo, mp3, mp4 audio, Flash, wav and more, see <ulink url="http://www.helixdna.com">HelixDNA</ulink> (not all components of this software are completely free).</para></listitem>
 <listitem><para><command>rhythmbox</command>: based on the <application>GStreamer</application> framework, can play everything supported in <application>GStreamer</application>, which claims to be able to play everything, see the <ulink url="http://www.rhythmbox.org">Rhythmbox</ulink> and <ulink url="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org">GStreamer</ulink> sites.</para></listitem>
 </itemizedlist>

 <para>Check your system documentation and man pages for particular tools and detailed explanations on how to use them.</para>

 <note><title>I don't have these applications on my system!</title>
 <para>A lot of the tools and applications discussed in the above sections are optional software.  It is possible that such applications are not installed on your system by default, but that you can find them in your distribution as additional packages.  It might also very well be that the application that you are looking for is not in your distribution at all.  In that case, you need to download it from the application's web site.</para>
 </note>
 </sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_11_02_02_03"><title>Volume control</title>
<para><command>aumix</command> and <command>alsamixer</command> are two common t
ext tools for adjusting audio controls.  Use the arrow keys to toggle settings.  The <command>alsamixer</command> has a graphical interface when started from the Gnome menu or as <command>gnome-alsamixer</command> from the command line.  The <command>kmix</command> tool does the same in KDE.</para>
<para>Regardless of how you choose to listen to music or other sounds, remember 
that there may be other people who may not be interested in hearing you or your 
computer.  Try to be courteous, especially in office environments.  And use a qu
ality head-set.</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_11_02_03"><title>Recording</title>
<para>Various tools are again available that allow you to record voice and music.  For recording voice you can use <command>arecord</command> on the command line:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>alexey@russia:~&gt;</prompt> <command>arecord <filename>/var/tmp/myvoice.wav</filename></command>
Recording WAVE '/var/tmp/myvoice.wav' : Unsigned 8 bit, Rate 8000 Hz, Mono
Aborted by signal Interrups...
</screen>
<para><quote>Interrupt</quote> means that the application has caught a <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>+<keycap>C</keycap>.  Play the sample using the simple <command>play</command> command.</para>
<para>This is a good test that you can execute prior to testing applications that need voice input, like Voice over IP (VoIP).  Keep in mind that the microphone input should be activated.  If you don't hear your own voice, check your sound settings.  It often happens that the microphone is muted or on verry low volume.  This can be easily adjusted using <command>alsamixer</command> or your distribution-specific graphical interface to the sound system.</para>

<sect1 id="sect_11_02_04"><title>Video playing, streams and television watchi
ng</title>
<para>Various players are available:</para>

</itemizedlist>
<para>Most likely, you will find one of these in your graphical menus.</para>
<para>The <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/">LDP</ulink> released a new document recently that is very appropriate for this section.  It is entitled <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/DVD-Playback-HOWTO/index.html">DVD Playback HOWTO</ulink> and describes the different tools available for viewing movies on a syst
em that has a DVD drive.  It is a fine addition to the <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/DVD-HOWTO.html">DVD HOWTO</ulink> that explains installation
 of the drive.</para>
 <para>For watching TV there is choice of the following tools, among many others 
 for watching and capturing TV, video and other streams:</para>
 <itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><command>tvtime</command>: great program with station management
, interaction with teletext, film mode and <ulink url="http://tvtime.sourceforge

<sect1 id="sect_11_02_05"><title>Internet Telephony</title>
<sect2 id="sect_11_02_05_01"><title>What is it?</title>
<para>Internet telephony, or more common, Voice over IP (VoIP) or digital telephony allows parties to exchange voice data flows over the network.  The big difference is that the data flows over a general purpose network, the Internet, contrary to conventional telephony, that uses a dedicated network of voice transmission lines.  The two networks can be connected, however, under special circumstances, but for now this is certainly not a standard.  In other words: it is very likely that you will not be able to call people who are using a conventional telephone.</para>
<para>While there are currently various applications available for free download, both free and proprietary, there are some major drawbacks to telephony over the Internet.  Most noticably, the system is unreliable, it can be slow or there can be a lot of noise on the connection, and it can thus certainly not be used to replace conventional telephony - think about emergency calls.  While some providers take their precautions, there is no guarantee that you can reach the party that you want to call.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_11_05_02"><title>What do you need?</title>
<sect3 id="sect_11_05_02_01"><title>Server Side</title>
<para>First of all, you need a provider offering the service.  This service might integrate traditional telephony and it might or might not be free.  Among others are <ulink url="http://www.sipphone.com/">SIPphone</ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.vonage.com/">Vonage</ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.lingo.com/">Lingo</ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.totaltalk.com/">AOL TotalTalk</ulink> and many locally accessible providers offering the so-called <quote>full phone service</quote>.  Internet phone service only is offered by <ulink url="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.sipbroker.com/">SIP Broker</ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google</ulink> and many others.</para>
<para>If you want to set up a server of your own, you might want to look into <ulink url="http://www.asterisk.org">Asterisk</ulink>, <ulink url="http://gizmoproject.com/">Gizmo</ulink> or <ulink url="http://www.gnomemeeting.org/">GnomeMeeting</ulink>, just to name some.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_11_05_02_02"><title>Client Side</title>
<para>On the client side, the applications that you can use depend on your network configuration.  If you have a direct Internet connection, there won't be any problems, provided that you know on what server you can connect, and usually that you also have a username and password to authenticate to the service.</para>
<para>If you are behind a firewall that does Network Address Translation (NAT), however, some services might not work, as they will only see the IP address of the firewall and not the address of your computer, which might well be unroutable over the Internet, for instance when you are in a company network and your IP address starts with 10., 192.168. or another non-routable subnet prefix.  This depends on the protocol that is used by the application.</para>
<para>Also, available bandwidth might be a blocking factor: some applications are optimized for low bandwidth consumption, while others might require high bandwidth connections.  This depends on the codec that is used by the application.</para>
<para>Among the most common applications are the Skype client, which has an interface that reminds of instant messaging, and <ulink url="http://www.counterpath/">X-Lite</ulink>, the free version of the <application>XTen softphone</application>, which looks like a mobile telephone.</para>
<tip><title>Client hardware</title>
<para>While your computer,m especially if it is a laptop PC, might have a built-in microphone, the result will be far better if you connect a headset.  If you have the choice, opt for a USB headset, as it functions independently from existing audio hardware.</para>
</tip>
<para>VoIP applications are definitely a booming market.  Volunteers try to document the current status at <ulink url="http://www.voip-info.org/" />.</para>
