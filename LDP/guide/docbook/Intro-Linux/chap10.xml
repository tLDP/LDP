<abstract>
<para>When it comes to networking, Linux is your operating system of choice, not only because networking is tightly integrated with the OS itself and a wide variety of free tools and applications are available, but for the robustness under heavy loads that can only be achieved after years of debugging and testing in an Open Source project.</para>
<para>Bookshelves full of information have been written about Linux and networking, but we will try to give an overview in this chapter.  After completing this, you will know more about</para>

<sect1 id="sect_10_01"><title>Networking Overview</title>
<sect2 id="sect_10_01_01"><title>Networking protocols</title>
<para>A protocol is, simply put, a set of rules for communication.</para>
<para>Linux supports many different networking protocols.  We list only the most important:</para>
<sect3 id="sect_10_01_01_01"><title>TCP/IP</title>
<para>The Transport Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol are the two most popular ways of communicating on the Internet.  A lot of applications, such as your browser and E-mail program, are built on top of this protocol suite.</para>
<para>Very simply put, IP provides a solution for sending packets of information from one machine to another, while TCP ensures that the packets are arranged in streams, so that packets from different applications don't get mixed up, and that the packets are sent and received in the correct order.</para>
<para>The Internet was originally developed three decades ago for the United States Department of Defense (DoD), mainly for the purpose of interconnecting different-brand computers.  Another reason for the development of TCP/IP was to provide a reliable data transport system over an unreliable network.</para>
<para>TCP/IP networking has been present in Linux since its beginnings. It has been implemented from scratch. It is one of the most robust, fast and reliable implementations and is one of the key factors of the success of Linux.  Linux and networking are made for each other, in so much that not connecting your Linux system to the network may result in slow startup and other troubles.  Even if you don't use any network connections to other computers, networking protocols are used for internal system and application communications.  Linux expects to be networked.
</para>
<para>A good starting point for learning more about TCP and IP is in the following documents:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><command>man <option>7</option> <parameter>ip</parameter></command>: Describes the IPv4 protocol implementation on Linux (version 4 currently being the most wide-spread edition of the IP protocol).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>man <option>7</option> <parameter>tcp</parameter></command>: Implementation of the TCP protocol.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>RFC793, RFC1122, RFC2001 for TCP, and RFC791, RFC1122 and RFC1112 for IP.</para>
<para>The Request For Comments documents contain the descriptions of networking standards, protocols, applications and implementation.  These documents are managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force, an international community concerned with the smooth operation of the Internet and the evolution and development of the Internet architecture.</para>
<para>Your ISP usually has an RFC archive available, or you can browse the RFCs via <ulink url="http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html" />.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>


</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_01_01_02"><title>TCP/IPv6</title>
<para>Nobody expected the Internet to grow as fast as it does.  IP proved to have quite some disadvantages when a really large number of computers is in a network, the most important being the availability of unique addresses to assign to each machine participating.  Thus, IP version 6 was deviced to meet the needs of today's Internet.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, not all applications and services support IPv6, yet.  A migration is currently being set in motion in many environments that can benefit from an upgrade to IPv6.  For some applications, the old protocol is still used, for applications that have been reworked the new version is already active.  So when checking your network configuration, sometimes it might be a bit confusing since all kinds of measures can be taken to hide one protocol from the other so as the two don't mix up connections.</para>
<para>More information can be found in the following documents:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><command>man <option>7</option> <parameter>ipv6</parameter></command>: the Linux IPv6 protocol implementation.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>RFC1883 describing the IPv6 protocol.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_01_01_03"><title>PPP, SLIP, PLIP, PPPOE</title>
<para>The Linux kernel has built-in support for PPP (Point-to-Point-Protocol), SLIP (Serial Line IP) and PLIP (Parallel Line IP). PPP is the most popular way individual users access their ISP (Internet Service Provider), although in densely populated areas it is often being replaced by PPPOE, PPP over Ethernet, the protocol used in cable modem connections.</para>
<para>Most Linux distributions provide easy-to-use tools for setting up an Internet connection.  The only thing you basically need is a username and password to connect to your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and a telephone number in the case of PPP.  These data are entered in the graphical configuration tool, which will likely also allow for starting and stopping the connection to your provider.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_01_01_04"><title>ISDN</title>
<para>The Linux kernel has built-in ISDN capabilities. Isdn4linux controls ISDN PC cards and can emulate a modem with the Hayes command set (<quote>AT</quote> commands). The possibilities range from simply using a terminal program to full connection to the Internet.</para>
<para>Check your system documentation.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_01_01_05"><title>AppleTalk</title>
<para>Appletalk is the name of Apple's internetworking stack. It allows a peer-to-peer network model which provides basic functionality such as file and printer sharing. Each machine can simultaneously act as a client and a server, and the software and hardware necessary are included with every Apple computer.</para>
<para>Linux provides full AppleTalk networking. Netatalk is a kernel-level implementation of the AppleTalk Protocol Suite, originally for BSD-derived systems. It includes support for routing AppleTalk, serving UNIX and AFS file systems using AppleShare and serving UNIX printers and accessing AppleTalk printers.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_01_01_07"><title>SMB/NMB</title>
<para>For compatibility with MS Windows environments, the Samba suite, including support for the NMB and SMB protocols, can be installed on any UNIX-like system.  The Server Message Block protocol (also called Session Message Block, NetBIOS or LanManager protocol) is used on MS Windows 3.11, NT, 95/98, 2K and XP to share disks and printers.</para>
<para>The basic functions of the Samba suite are:  sharing Linux drives with Windows machines, accessing SMB shares from Linux machines, sharing Linux printers with Windows machines and sharing Windows printers with Linux machines.</para>
<para>Most Linux distributions provide a <emphasis>samba</emphasis> package, which does most of the server setup and starts up <command>smbd</command>, the Samba server, and <command>nmbd</command>, the netbios name server, at boot time by default.  Samba can be configured graphically, via a web interface or via the command line and text configuration files.  The daemons make a Linux machine appear as an MS Windows host in an MS Windows My Network Places/Network Neighbourhood window; a share from a Linux machine will be indistinguishable from a share on any other host in an MS Windows environment.</para>

<sect3 id="sect_10_01_01_08"><title>Miscellaneous protocols</title>
<para>Linux also has support for Amateur Radio, WAN internetworking (X25, Frame Relay, ATM), InfraRed and other wireless connections, but since these protocols usually require special hardware, we won't discuss them in this document.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_10_01_02"><title>Network configuration and information</title>
<sect3 id="sect_10_01_02_01"><title>Configuration of local network interfaces</title>
<para>All the big, userfriendly Linux distributions come with various graphical tools, allowing for easy setup of the computer in a local network or for connecting it to an Internet Service Provider.  These tools can be started up from the command line or from a menu:</para><itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>RedHat Linux comes with <command>redhat-config-network</command>, which has both a graphical and a text mode interface.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Suse's YAST or YAST2 is an all-in-one configuration tool.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Mandrake/Mandriva comes with a Network and Internet Configuration Wizard, which is preferably started up from Mandrake's Control Center.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Your system documentation provides plenty of advice and information about availability and use of tools.</para>
<para>Information you'll need to provide:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>For connecting to the local network, for instance with your home computers, or at work: hostname, domainname and IP address.  If you want to set up your own network, best do some more reading first.  At work, this information is likely to be given to your computer automatically when you boot it up.  When in doubt, it is better not to specify any information than making it up.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>For connecting to the Internet: username and password for your ISP, telephone number when using a modem.  Your ISP usually automatically assigns you a hostname, IP address and all the other things necessary for your Internet applications to work.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="sect_10_01_02_02"><title>Network configuration files</title>
<para>The graphical helper tools edit a specific set of network configuration files, using a couple of basic commands.  The exact names of the configuration files and their location in the file system is largely dependent on your Linux distribution and version.  However, a couple of network configuration files are common on all UNIX systems:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><filename>/etc/hosts</filename>: always contains the <emphasis>localhost</emphasis> IP address, 127.0.0.1, which is used for interprocess communication.  Never remove this line!  Sometimes contains addresses of additional hosts, which can be contacted without using an external naming service such as DNS (the Domain Name Server).</para>
<para>A sample <filename>hosts</filename> file for a small home network:</para>

<para>This instructs your computer to look up hostnames and IP addresses first in the <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> file, and to contact the DNS server if a given host does not occur in the local <filename>hosts</filename> file.  Other possible name services to contact are LDAP, NIS and NIS+.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_01_02_03"><title>Network configuration commands</title>
<para>The distribution-specific scripts and graphical tools use <command>ip</command> (or <command>ifconfig</command> and <command>route</command> on older systems) to configure the kernel's networking configuration.</para>
<para>The <command>ip</command> command is used for assigning IP addresses to interfaces, for setting up routes to the Internet and to other networks, for displaying TCP/IP configurations etcetera.</para>
<para>The following commands show IP address and routing information:</para>

<para>On your laptop which you usually connect to the company network using the onboard Ethernet connection, but which you are now to configure for dial-in at home or in a hotel, you might need to activate the PCMCIA card.  This is done using the <command>cardctl</command> control utility.  However, a good distribution should provide PCMCIA support in the network configuration tools, preventing users from having to execute PCMCIA commands manually.</para>

<para>On a Linux machine, the device name <emphasis>lo</emphasis> or the <emphasis>local loop</emphasis> is linked with the internal 127.0.0.1 address.  The computer will have a hard time making your applications work if this device is not present; it is always there, even on computers which are not networked.</para>
<para>The first ethernet device, <emphasis>eth0</emphasis> in the case of a standard network interface card, points to your local LAN IP address.  Normal client machines only have one network interface card.  Routers, connecting networks together, have one network device for each network they serve.</para>

<sect1 id="sect_10_02"><title>Internet/Intranet applications</title>
<para>The Linux system is a great platform for offering networking services.  In this section, we will try to give an overview of most common network servers and applications.</para>
<sect2 id="sect_10_02_01"><title>Server types</title>
<sect3 id="sect_10_02_01_01"><title>Standalone server</title>
<para>Offering a service to users can be approached in two ways.  A daemon or service can run in standalone mode, or it can be dependent on another service to be activated.</para>
<para>Network services that are heavily and/or continuously used, usually run in the standalone mode: they are independent program daemons that are always running.  They are most likely started up at system boot time, and they wait for requests on the specific connection points or ports for which they are set up to listen.  When a request comes, it is processed, and the listening continues until the next request.  A web server is a typical example: you want it to be available 24 hours a day, and if it is too busy it should create more listening instances to serve simultaneous users.  Other examples are the large software archives such as <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net">Sourceforge</ulink> or <ulink url="http://tucows.com">your Tucows mirror</ulink>, which must handle thousands of FTP requests per day.</para>
<para>An example of a standalone network service on your home computer might be the <command>named</command>, a caching name server.  Standalone services have there own processes running, you can check any time using <command>ps</command>:</para>

<para>Let's see in the next section how this is arranged.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_02_01_02"><title>(x)inetd</title>
<para>On your home PC, things are usually a bit calmer.  You may have a small network, for instance, and you may have to transfer files from one PC to another from time to time, using FTP or Samba (for connectivity with MS Windows machines).  In those cases, starting all the services which you only need occasionally and having them run all the time would be a waste of resources.  So in smaller setups, you will find the necessary daemons dependent on a central program, that listen on all the ports of the services for which it is responsible.</para>  
<para>This super-server, the Internet services daemon, is started up at system initialization time.  There are two common implementations: <command>inetd</command> and <command>xinetd</command> (the extended Internet services daemon).  One or the other is usually running on every Linux system:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>bob:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ps -ef | grep inet</command>
root  926   1 0 Mar14 ?   00:00:00 xinetd-ipv6 -stayalive -reuse \
-pidfile /var/run/xinetd.pid
</screen>
<para>The services for which the Internet daemon is responsible, are listed in its configuration file, <filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename>, for <command>inetd</command>, and in the directory <filename>/etc/xinetd.d</filename> for <command>xinetd</command>.  Commonly managed services include file share and print services, SSH, FTP, telnet, the Samba configuration daemon, talk and time services.</para>
<para>As soon as a connection request is received, the central server will start an instance of the required server.  Thus, in the example below, when user <emphasis>bob</emphasis> starts an FTP session to the local host, an FTP daemon is running as long as the session is active:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>bob:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ps auxw | grep ftp</command>
bob     793  0.1  0.2  3960 1076 pts/6    S    16:44   0:00 ncftp localhost
ftp     794  0.7  0.5  5588 2608 ?        SN   16:44   0:00 ftpd: 
localhost.localdomain: anonymous/bob@his.server.com: IDLE
</screen>
<para>Of course, the same happens when you open connections to remote hosts: either a daemon answers directly, or a remote <command>(x)inetd</command> starts the service you need and stops it when you quit.</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="sect_10_02_02"><title>Mail</title>
<sect3 id="sect_10_02_02_01"><title>Servers</title>
<para><emphasis>Sendmail</emphasis> is the standard mail server program or Mail Transport Agent for UNIX platforms.  It is robust, scalable, and when properly configured with appropriate hardware, handles thousands of users without blinking.  More information about how to configure Sendmail is included with the sendmail and sendmail-cf packages, you may want to read the <filename>README</filename> and <filename>README.cf</filename> files in <filename>/usr/share/doc/sendmail</filename>.  The <command>man <parameter>sendmail</parameter></command> and <command>man <parameter>aliases</parameter></command> are also useful.</para>
<para>Qmail is another mail server, gaining popularity because it claims to be more secure than Sendmail.  While Sendmail is a monolithic program, Qmail consists of smaller interacting program parts that can be better secured.</para>
<para>These servers handle mailing lists, filtering, virus scanning and much more.  Free and commercial scanners are available for use with Linux.  Examples of mailing list software are Mailman, Listserv, Majordomo and EZmlm.  See the web page of your favorite virus scanner for information on Linux client and server support.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_02_02_02"><title>Remote mail servers</title>
<para>The most popular protocols to access mail remotely are <emphasis>POP3</emphasis> and <emphasis>IMAP4</emphasis>.  IMAP and POP both allow offline operation, remote access to new mail and they both rely on an SMTP server to send mail.</para>
<para>While POP is a simple protocol, easy to implement and supported by almost any mail client, IMAP is to be preferred because:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>It can manipulate persistent message status flags.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>It can store as well as fetch mail messages.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>It can access and manage multiple mailboxes.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>It supports concurrent updates and shared mailboxes.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>It is also suitable for accessing Usenet messages and other documents.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>IMAP works both on-line and off-line.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>it is optimized for on-line performance, especially over low-speed links.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_02_02_03"><title>Mail user-agents</title>
<para>There are plenty of both text and graphical E-mail clients, we'll just name a few of the common ones.  Pick your favorite.</para>
<para>The UNIX <command>mail</command> command has been around for years, even before networking existed.  It is a simple interface to send messages and small files to other users, who can then save the message, redirect it, reply to it and such.</para>
<para>While it is not commonly used as a client anymore, the <command>mail</command> program is still useful, for example to mail the output of a command to somebody:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>mail <email>future.employer@whereIwant2work.com</email> &lt; <filename>cv.txt</filename></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>The <command>elm</command> mail reader is a much needed improvement to <command>mail</command>, and so is <command>pine</command> (Pine Is Not ELM).  The <command>mutt</command> mail reader is even more recent and offers features like threading.</para>
<para>For those users who prefer a graphical interface to their mail (and a tennis elbow or a mouse arm), there are hundreds of options.  The most popular for new users are Mozilla Mail and the Ximian MS Exchange clone, Evolution, of which you can see a screenshot below:</para>

<para>There are also tens of web mail applications available.</para>
<para>An overview is available via the <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Mail-User-HOWTO/index.html">Linux Mail User HOWTO</ulink>.</para>

<para>Most Linux distributions include <command>fetchmail</command>, a mail-retrieval and forwarding utility.  It fetches mail from remote mail servers (POP, IMAP and some others) and forwards it to your local delivery system.  You can then handle the retrieved mail using normal mail clients.  It can be run in daemon mode to repeatedly poll one or more systems at a specified interval.  Information and usage examples can be found in the Info pages; the directory <filename>/usr/share/doc/fetchmail-&lt;version&gt;</filename> contains a full list of features and a FAQ for beginners.</para>

<para>The <command>procmail</command> filter can be used for filtering incoming mail, to create mailing lists, to pre-process mail, to selectively forward mail and more.  The accompanying <command>formail</command> program, among others, enables generation of auto-replies and splitting up mailboxes.  Procmail has been around for years on UNIX and Linux machines and is a very robust system, designed to work even in the worst circumstances.  More information may be found in the <filename>/usr/share/doc/procmail-&lt;version&gt;</filename> directory and in the man pages.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_10_02_03"><title>Web</title>
<sect3 id="sect_10_02_03_01"><title>The Apache Web Server</title>
<para>Apache is by far the most popular web server, used on more than half of all Internet web servers.  Most Linux distributions include Apache.  Apache's advantages include its modular design, SSL support, stability and speed. Given the appropriate hardware and configuration it can support the highest loads.</para>
<para>On Linux systems, the server configuration is usually done in the <filename>/etc/httpd</filename> directory.  The most important configuration file is <filename>httpd.conf</filename>; it is rather self-explanatory.  Should you need help, you can find it in the <command>httpd</command> man page or on the <ulink url="http://www.apache.org">Apache website</ulink>.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_02_03_02"><title>Web browsers</title>
<para>A number of web browsers, both free and commercial, exist for the Linux platform.  Netscape Navigator has long been the only decent option, but with Mozilla a competitive alternative is available.</para>
<para>Amaya is the W3C browser.  Opera is a commercial browser, compact and fast.  Many desktop managers offer web browsing features in their file manager, like <command>nautilus</command>.</para>
<para>Among the popular text based browsers are <command>lynx</command> and <command>links</command>.  You may need to define proxy servers in your shell, by setting the appropriate variables.  Text browsers are fast and handy when no graphical environment is available, such as when used in scripts.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_10_02_04"><title>File Transfer Protocol</title>
<sect3 id="sect_10_02_04_01"><title>FTP servers</title>
<para>On a Linux system, an FTP server is typically run from <command>xinetd</command>, using the <emphasis>WU-ftpd</emphasis> server, although the FTP server may be configured as a stand-alone server on systems with heavy FTP traffic.  See the exercises.</para>
<para>Other FTP servers include among others <emphasis>Ncftpd</emphasis> and <emphasis>Proftpd</emphasis>.</para>
<para>Most Linux distributions contain the <emphasis>anonftp</emphasis> package, which sets up an anonymous FTP server tree and accompanying configuration files.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_02_04_02"><title>FTP clients</title>
<para>Most Linux distributions include <command>ncftp</command>, an improved version of the common UNIX <command>ftp</command> command, which you may also know from the Windows command line.  The <command>ncftp</command> program offers extra features such as a nicer and more comprehensible user interface, file name completion, append and resume functions, bookmarking, session management and more:</para>

<sect2 id="sect_10_02_07"><title>The Domain Name System</title>
<para>All these applications need DNS services to match IP addresses to host names and vice versa.  A DNS server does not know all the IP addresses in the world, but networks with other DNS servers which it can query to find an unknown address.  Most UNIX systems can run <command>named</command>, which is part of the bind (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) package distributed by the Internet Software Consortium.

For configuring the server, you will need to read the HOWTO.</para>
<para>DHCP client machines will usually be configured using a GUI that configures the <command>dhcpcd</command>, the DHCP client daemon.  Check your system documentation if you need to configure your machine as a DHCP client.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_10_02_09"><title>Authentication services</title>
<sect3 id="sect_10_02_09_01"><title>Traditional</title>
<para>Traditionally, users are authenticated locally, using the information stored in <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> and <filename>/etc/shadow</filename> on each system.  But even when using a network service for authenticating, the local files will always be present to configure system accounts for administrative use, such as the root account, the daemon accounts and often accounts for additional programs and purposes.</para>
<para>These files are often the first candidates for being examined by hackers, so make sure the permissions and ownerships are strictly set as should be:</para>

<sect3 id="sect_10_02_09_03"><title>LDAP</title>
<para>The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is a client-server system for accessing global or local directory services over a network.  On Linux, the OpenLDAP implementation is used.  It includes <command>slapd</command>, a stand-alone server; <command>slurpd</command>, a stand-alone LDAP replication server; libraries implementing the LDAP protocol and a series of utilities, tools and sample clients.</para>
<para> The main benefit of using LDAP is the consolidation of certain types of information within your organization. For example, all of the different lists of users within your organization can be merged into one LDAP directory. This directory can be queried by any LDAP-enabled applications that need this information. It can also be accessed by users who need directory information.
</para><para>
Other LDAP or X.500 Lite benefits include its ease of implementation (compared to X.500) and its well-defined Application Programming Interface (API), which means that the number of LDAP-enabled applications and LDAP gateways should increase in the future.
</para><para>
On the negative side, if you want to use LDAP, you will need LDAP-enabled applications or the ability to use LDAP gateways. While LDAP usage should only increase, currently there are not very many LDAP-enabled applications available for Linux. Also, while LDAP does support some access control, it does not possess as many security features as X.500.
</para>
<para> Since LDAP is an open and configurable protocol, it can be used to store almost any type of information relating to a particular organizational structure.  Common examples are mail address lookups, central authentication in combination with PAM, telephone directories and machine configuration databases.</para>
<para>See your system specific information and the man pages for related commands such as <command>ldapmodify</command> and <command>ldapsearch</command> for details.  More information can be found in the <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LDAP-HOWTO.html">LDAP Linux HOWTO</ulink>, which discusses installation, configuration, running and maintenance of an LDAP server on Linux.  The <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LDAP-Implementation-HOWTO/index.html">LDAP Implementation HOWTO</ulink> describes the technical aspects of storing application data in an LDAP server.

<sect1 id="sect_10_03"><title>Remote execution of applications</title>
<sect2 id="sect_10_03_01"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>There are a couple of different ways to execute commands or run programs on a remote machine and have the output, be it text or graphics, sent to your workstation.  The connections can be secure or insecure.  While it is of course advised to use secure connections instead of transporting your password over the network unencrypted, we will discuss some practical applications of the older (unsafe) mechanisms, as they are still useful in a modern networked environment, such as for troubleshooting or running exotic programs.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_10_03_02"><title>Rsh, rlogin and telnet</title>
<para>The <command>rlogin</command> and <command>rsh</command> commands for remote login and remote execution of commands are inherited from UNIX.  While seldom used because they are blatantly insecure, they still come with almost every Linux distribution for backward compatibility with UNIX programs.</para>
<para>Telnet, on the other hand, is still commonly used, often by system and network administrators.  Telnet is one of the most powerful tools for remote access to files and remote administration, allowing connections from anywhere on the Internet.  Combined with an X server, remote graphical applications can be displayed locally.  There is no difference between working on the local machine and using the remote machine.</para>
<para>Because the entire connection is unencrypted, allowing <command>telnet</command> connections involves taking high security risks.  For normal remote execution of programs, Secure SHell or <command>ssh</command> is advised.  We will discuss the secure method later in this section.</para>
<para>However, <command>telnet</command> is still used in many cases.  Below are some examples in which a mail server and a web server are tested for replies:</para>

<para>As we already explained in Chapter 7 (see <xref linkend="sect_07_03_03" />), the X Window system comes with an X server which serves graphics to clients that need a display.</para>
<para>It is important to realize the distinction between the X server and the X client application(s).  The X server controls the display directly and is responsible for all input and output via keyboard, mouse and display.  The X client, on the other hand, does not access the input and output devices directly.  It communicates with the X server which handles input and output.  It is the X client which does the real work, like computing values, running applications and so forth.  The X server only opens windows to handle input and output for the specified client.</para>
<para>In normal operation (runlevel five, graphical mode), every Linux workstation is an X server to itself, even if it only runs client applications.  All the applications you are running (for example, Gimp, a terminal window, your browser, your office application, your CD playing tool, and so on) are clients to your X server.  Server and client are running on the same machine in this case.</para>
<para>This client/server nature of the X system makes it an ideal environment for remote execution of applications and programs.  Because the process is actually being executed on the remote machine, very little CPU power is needed on the local host.  Such machines, purely acting as servers for X, are called X terminals and were once very popular.  More information may be found in the <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/mini/Remote-X-Apps.html">Remote X applications mini-HOWTO</ulink>.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_03_03_02"><title>Telnet and X</title>
<para>If you would want to use <command>telnet</command> to display graphical applications running on a remote machine, you first need to give the remote machine access to your display (to your X server!) using the <command>xhost</command> command, by typing a command similar to the one below in a terminal window on your local machine:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>davy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>xhost +remote.machine.com</command>
</screen>
<para>After that, connect to the remote host and tell it to display graphics on the local machine by setting the environment variable <varname>DISPLAY</varname>:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>[davy@remote ~]</prompt> <command>export DISPLAY="local.host.com:0.0"</command>
</screen>
<para>After completing this step, any application started in this terminal window will be displayed on your local desktop, using remote resources for computing, but your local graphical resources (your X server) for displaying the application.</para>
<para>This procedure assumes that you have some sort of X server (XFree86, Exceed, Cygwin) already set up on the machine where you want to display images.  The architecture and operating system of the client machine are not important as long as they allow you to run an X server on it.</para>
<para>Mind that displaying a terminal window from the remote machine is also considered to be a display of an image.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_10_03_04"><title>The SSH suite</title>
<sect3 id="sect_10_03_04_01"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>Most UNIX and Linux systems now run Secure SHell in order to leave out the security risks that came with <command>telnet</command>.  Most Linux systems will run a version of OpenSSH, an Open Source implementation of the SSH protocol, providing secure encrypted communications between untrusted hosts over an untrusted network.  In the standard setup X connections are automatically forwarded, but arbitrary TCP/IP ports may also be forwarded using a secure channel.</para>
<para>The <command>ssh</command> client connects and logs into the specified host name.  The user must provide his identity to the remote machine as specified in the <filename>sshd_config</filename> file, which can usually be found in <filename>/etc/ssh</filename>.  The configuration file is rather self-explanatory and by defaults enables most common features.  Should you need help, you can find it in the <command>sshd</command> man pages.</para>
<para>When the user's identity has been accepted by the server, the server either executes the given command, or logs into the machine and gives the user a normal shell on the remote machine.  All communication with the remote command or shell will be automatically encrypted.</para>
<para>The session terminates when the command or shell on the remote machine exits and all X11 and TCP/IP connections have been closed.</para>
<para>When connecting to a host for the first time, using any of the programs that are included in the SSH collection, you need to establish the authenticity of that host and acknowledge that you want to connect:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>lenny ~&gt;</prompt> <command>ssh blob</command>
The authenticity of host 'blob (10.0.0.1)' can't be established.
RSA fingerprint is 18:30:50:46:ac:98:3c:93:1a:56:35:09:8d:97:e3:1d.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? <command>yes</command>
Warning: Permanently added 'blob,192.168.30.2' (RSA) to the list of 
known hosts.

<para>If you just want to check something on a remote machine and then get your prompt back on the local host, you can give the commands that you want to execute remotely as arguments to <command>ssh</command>:</para>

<sect3 id="sect_10_03_04_02"><title>X11 and TCP forwarding</title>
<para>If the <varname>X11Forwarding</varname> entry is set to <emphasis>yes</emphasis> and the user is using X applications, the <varname>DISPLAY</varname> environment variable is set, the connection to the X11 display is automatically forwarded to the remote side in such a way that any X11 programs started from the shell will go through the encrypted channel, and the connection to the real X server will be made from the local machine.  The user should not manually set <varname>DISPLAY</varname>.  Forwarding of X11 connections can be configured on the command line or in the <command>sshd</command> configuration file.</para>
<para>The value for <varname>DISPLAY</varname> set by <command>ssh</command> will point to the server machine, but with a display number greater than zero.  This is normal, and happens because <command>ssh</command> creates a <emphasis>proxy</emphasis> X server on the server machine (that runs the X client application) for forwarding the connections over the encrypted channel.</para>
<para>This is all done automatically, so when you type in the name of a graphical application, it is displayed on your local machine and not on the remote host.  We use <command>xclock</command> in the example, since it is a small program which is generally installed and ideal for testing:</para>
<figure><title>SSH X11 forwarding</title>

<imagedata fileref="images/ssh_X11.png" format="PNG"></imagedata>
</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<para>SSH will also automatically set up Xauthority data on the server machine.  For this purpose, it will generate a random authorization cookie, store it in <filename>Xauthority</filename> on the server, and verify that any forwarded connections carry this cookie and replace it by the real cookie when the connection is opened.  The real authentication cookie is never sent to the server machine (and no cookies are sent in the plain).</para>
<para>Forwarding of arbitrary TCP/IP connections over the secure channel can be specified either on the command line or in a configuration file.</para>  
<note><title>The X server</title>
<para>This procedure assumes that you have a running X server on the client where you want to display the application from the remote host.  The client may be of different architecture and operating system than the remote host, as long as it can run an X server, such as Cygwin (which implements an XFree86 server for MS Windows clients and others) or Exceed, it should be possible to set up a remote connection with any Linux or UNIX machine.</para></note>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_03_04_03"><title>Server authentication</title>
<para>The <command>ssh</command> client/server system automatically maintains and checks a database containing identifications for all hosts it has ever been used with.  Host keys are stored in <filename>$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts</filename> in the user's home directory.  Additionally, the file <filename>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</filename> is automatically checked for known hosts.  Any new hosts are automatically added to the user's file.  If a host's identification ever changes, <command>ssh</command> warns about this and disables password authentication to prevent a Trojan horse from getting the user's password.  Another purpose of this mechanism is to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks which could otherwise be used to circumvent the encryption.  In environments where high security is needed, <command>sshd</command> can even be configured to prevent logins to machines whose host keys have changed or are unknown.</para>

<sect3 id="sect_10_03_04_04"><title>Secure remote copying</title>
<para>The SSH suite provides <command>scp</command> as a secure alternative to the <command>rcp</command> command that used to be popular when only <command>rsh</command> existed.  <command>scp</command> uses <command>ssh</command> for data transfer, uses the same authentication and provides the same security as <command>ssh</command>.  Unlike <command>rcp</command>, <command>scp</command> will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for authentication:</para>

<sect3 id="sect_10_03_04_05"><title>Authentication keys</title>
<para>The <command>ssh-keygen</command> command generates, manages and converts authentication keys for <command>ssh</command>.  It can create RSA keys for use by SSH protocol version 1 and RSA or DSA keys for use by SSH protocol version 2.</para>
<para>Normally each user wishing to use SSH with RSA or DSA authentication runs this once to create the authentication key in <filename>$HOME/.ssh/identity</filename>, <filename>id_dsa</filename> or <filename>id_rsa</filename>.  Additionally, the system administrator may use this to generate host keys for the system.</para>
<para>Normally this program generates the key and asks for a file in which to store the private key.  The public key is stored in a file with the same name but <emphasis>.pub</emphasis> appended.  The program also asks for a passphrase.  The passphrase may be empty to indicate no passphrase (host keys must have an empty passphrase), or it may be a string of arbitrary length.</para>
<para>There is no way to recover a lost passphrase.  If the passphrase is lost or forgotten, a new key must be generated and copied to the corresponding public keys.</para>
<para>We will study SSH keys in the exercises.  All information can be found in the man or Info pages.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_10_03_05"><title>VNC</title>
<para>VNC or Virtual Network Computing is in fact a remote display system which allows viewing a desktop environment not only on the local machine on which it is running, but from anywhere on the Internet and from a wide variety of machines and architectures, including MS Windows and several UNIX distributions.  You could, for example, run MS Word on a Windows NT machine and display the output on your Linux desktop.  VNC provides servers as well as clients, so the opposite also works and it may thus be used to display Linux programs on Windows clients.  VNC is probably the easiest way to have X connections on a PC.  The following features make VNC different from a normal X server or commercial implementations:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>No state is stored at the viewer side:  you can leave your desk and resume from another machine, continuing where you left.  When you are running a PC X server, and the PC crashes or is restarted, all remote applications that you were running will die.  With VNC, they keep on running.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>It is small and simple, no installation needed, can be run from a floppy if needed.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Platform independent with the Java client, runs on virtually everything that supports X.</para></listitem>

<sect2 id="sect_10_03_06"><title>The rdesktop protocol</title>
<para>In order to ease management of MS Windows hosts, recent Linux distributions support the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), which is implemented in the <command>rdesktop</command> client.  The protocol is used in a number of MicroSoft products, including Windows NT Terminal Server, Windows 2000 Server, Windows XP and Windows 2003 Server.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_10_05_01"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>As soon as a computer is connected to the network, all kinds of abuse becomes possible, be it a UNIX-based or any other system.  Admittedly, mountains of papers have been spilled on this subject and it would lead us too far to discuss the subject of security in detail.  There are, however, a couple of fairly logical things even a novice user can do to obtain a very secure system, because most break-ins are the result of ignorant or careless users.</para>
<para>Maybe you are asking yourself if this all applies to you, using your computer at home or working at your office on a desktop in a fairly protected environment.  The questions you should be asking yourself, however, are more on the lines of:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Do you want to be in control of your own system?</para></listitem>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_10_05_02"><title>Services</title>
<para>The goal is to run as few services as possible.  If the number of ports that are open for the outside world are kept to a minimum, this is all the better to keep an overview.  If services can't be turned off for the local network, try to at least disable them for outside connections.</para>
<para>A rule of thumb is that if you don't recognize a particular service, you probably won't need it anyway.  Also keep in mind that some services are not really meant to be used over the Internet.  Don't rely on what <emphasis>should</emphasis> be running, check which services are listening on what TCP ports using the <command>netstat</command> command:</para>
<screen>

<sect2 id="sect_10_05_03"><title>Update regularly</title>
<para>Its ability to adapt quickly in an ever changing environment is what makes Linux thrive.  But it also creates a possibility that security updates have been released even while you are installing a brand new version, so the first thing you should do (and this goes for about any OS you can think of) after installing is getting the updates as soon as possible.  After that, update <emphasis>all</emphasis> the packages you use regularly.</para>
<para>Some updates may require new configuration files, and old files may be replaced.  Check the documentation, and ensure that everything runs normal after updating.</para>
<para>Most Linux distributions provide mailing list services for security update announcements, and tools for applying updates to the system.  General Linux only security issues are reported among others at <ulink url="http://linuxsecurity.com">Linuxsecurity.com</ulink>.</para>
<para>Updating is an ongoing process, so it should be an almost daily habit.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_10_05_04"><title>Firewalls and access policies</title>
<sect3 id="sect_10_05_04_01"><title>What is a firewall?</title>
<para>In the previous section we already mentioned firewall capabilities in Linux.  While firewall administration is one of the tasks of your network admin, you should know a couple of things about firewalls.</para>
<para><emphasis>Firewall</emphasis> is a vague term that can mean anything that acts as a protective barrier between us and the outside world, generally the Internet.  A firewall can be a dedicated system or a specific application that provides this functionality. Or it can be a combination of components, including various combinations of hardware and software. Firewalls are built from <quote>rules</quote> that are used to define what is allowed to enter and/or exit a given system or network.</para>
<para>After disabling unnecessary services, we now want to restrict accepted services as to allow only the minimum required connections.  A fine example is working from home: only the specific connection between your office and your home should be allowed, connections from other machines on the Internet should be blocked.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_05_04_02"><title>Packet filters</title>
<para>The first line of defense is a <emphasis>packet filter</emphasis>, which can look inside IP packages and make decisions based on the content.  Systems running the <command>ipchains</command> firewall are based on 2.2 kernels.  Newer systems (2.4 kernel) use <command>iptables</command>, a next generation packet filter for Linux, and the Gnome Lokkit tool.  This tool was only created to provide an easy interface for normal users.  It sets up a basic firewall configuration for a desktop, a dial-up or cable modem connection, and that's about it.  It should not be used in larger environments.</para>
<para>One of the most noteworthy enhancements in the newer kernels is the <emphasis>stateful inspection</emphasis> feature, which not only tells what is inside a packet, but also detects if a packet belongs or is related to a new or existing connection.</para>
<para>Development is ongoing, so it is best to check with each new version of a distribution which system is being used.</para>
<para>More information can be found at <ulink url="http://www.netfilter.org/">the netfilter/iptables project page</ulink>.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_05_04_03"><title>TCP wrappers</title>
<para>TCP wrapping provides much the same results as the packet filters, but works differently.  The wrapper actually accepts the connection attempt, then examines configuration files and decides whether to accept or reject the connection request.  It controls connections at the application level rather than at the network level.</para>
<para>TCP wrappers are typically used with <command>xinetd</command> to provide host name and IP-address-based access control.  In addition, these tools include logging and utilization management capabilities that are easy to configure.</para>
<para>The advantages of TCP wrappers are that the connecting client is unaware that wrappers are used, and that they operate separately from the applications they protect.</para>
<para>The host based access is controlled in the <filename>hosts.allow</filename> and <filename>hosts.deny</filename> files.  More information can be found in the TCP wrapper documentation files in <filename>/usr/share/doc/tcp_wrappers-&lt;version&gt;/</filename> and in the man pages for the host based access control files, which contain examples.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_05_04_04"><title>Proxies</title>
<para>Proxies can perform various duties, not all of which have much to do with security. But the fact that they are an intermediary make proxies a good place to enforce access control policies, limit direct connections through a firewall, and control how the network behind the proxy looks to the Internet.</para>
<para>Usually in combination with a packet filter, but sometimes all by themselves, proxies provide an extra level of control.  More information can be found in the <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Firewall-HOWTO.html">Firewall HOWTO</ulink> or on the Squid website.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_05_04_05"><title>Access to individual applications</title>
<para>Some servers may have their own access control features.  Common examples include Samba, X11, Bind, Apache and CUPS.  For every service you want to offer check which configuration files apply.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_05_04_06"><title>Log files</title>
<para>If anything, the UNIX way of logging all kinds of activities into all kinds of files confirms that <quote>it is doing something.</quote>  Of course, log files should be checked regularly, manually or automatically.  Firewalls and other means of access control tend to create huge amounts of log files, so the trick is to try and only log abnormal activities.</para></sect3>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_10_05_05"><title>Intrusion detection</title>

<para> Intrusion Detection Systems are designed to catch what might have gotten past the firewall. They can either be designed to catch an active break-in attempt in progress, or to detect a successful break-in after the fact. In the latter case, it is too late to prevent any damage, but at least we have early awareness of a problem.  There are two basic types of IDS:  those protecting networks, and those protecting individual hosts.</para>
<para> For host based IDS, this is done with utilities that monitor the file system for changes. System files that have changed in some way, but should not change, are a dead give-away that something is amiss. Anyone who gets in and gets root access will presumably make changes to the system somewhere. This is usually the very first thing done, either so he can get back in through a backdoor, or to launch an attack against someone else, in which case, he has to change or add files to the system.  Some systems come with the <command>tripwire</command> monitoring system, which is documented at the <ulink url="http://www.tripwire.org">Tripwire Open Source Project</ulink> website.</para> 
<para>Network intrusion detection is handled by a system that sees all the traffic that passes the firewall (not by portscanners, which advertise usable ports).  <ulink url="http://www.snort.org">Snort</ulink> is an Open Source example of such a program.  Whitehats.com features an open Intrusion detection database, <ulink url="http://www.whitehats.com">arachNIDS</ulink>.  </para>

<sect1 id="sect_10_06"><title>Summary</title>
<para>Linux and networking go hand in hand.  The Linux kernel has support for all common and most uncommon network protocols.  The standard UNIX networking tools are provided in each distribution.  Next to those, most distributions offer tools for easy network installation and management.</para>
<para>Linux is well known as a stable platform for running various Internet services, the amount of Internet software is endless.  Like UNIX, Linux can be just as well used and administered from a remote location, using one of several solutions for remote execution of programs.</para>
<para>We briefly touched the subject of security.  Linux is an ideal firewall system, light and cheap, but can be used in several other network functions such as routers and proxy servers.</para>
<para>Increasing network security is mainly done by applying frequent updates and common sense.</para>
