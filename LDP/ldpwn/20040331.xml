<listitem><para>Gerardo Arnaez, Walt Pennington and Werner Heuser are the authors of the <ulink url="http://www.ibiblio.org/mdw/HOWTO/Medicine-HOWTO/index.html">Medicine HOWTO</ulink>.  And no, this does not tell you where to purchase the cheapest &lt;insert your favorite spam add for medicines here &gt; ;-)  Rather, it is a collection of links to important Linux and Open Source sites for doctors and other medical personal.  The HOWTO also discusses the recording, storage, retrieval, exchange and display of medical data, has pointers to mailinglists, information for veterinarians and discussions of various applications, including medical records and imaging applications.</para>

<title>New document proposals</title>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Haowen Zhang browsed our collection and other resources looking for information about the internals of System V Init.  Because he couldn't find what he was looking for, he asked whether it would be useful to have a <ulink url="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:6856:200403:olndaoabiighcgnbkaaj">System V Init HOWTO</ulink>.  There has not been a substantial proposal for the content yet, so if you think this might be interesting, join us on the <ulink url="http://tldp.org/mailinfo.html#maillists">discuss mailinglist</ulink>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Eventhough Eric Raymond posted an <ulink url="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/let-java-go.html">open letter to Sun, aruing in favour of the release of the Java source code</ulink>, Scott McNealy <ulink url="http://gcn.com/vol1_no1/daily-updates/25400-1.html">said that this won't happen any time soon</ulink>.  Jon Fox, who was working on an Enterprise Java document, <ulink url="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:6881:200403:nohedkmjcfkofpfedgpb">has moral objections</ulink> after hearing about this and fears he's wasting time and energy documenting a non-free platform.  He therefor stops working on the Enterprise Java document.</para>

<note><title>Choose a meaningful subject!</title>
<para>Dear Authors and other users of the submission mailinglist,</para>
<para>As you may have notices, the submission mailinglist is an open list and thus a target for spammers.  For your submissions to stand out, choose a sensible, meaningful subject when posting updates.  Include the name of your HOWTO, Guide or FAQ in the subject.  Otherwise it might pass unnoticed!</para>

<title>Linux Brochure Project to join TLDP</title>

<para>Barbara Irwin of the LBP <ulink url="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:6846:200403:ejilbecjpnmoeooninhc">announced a principal agreement between LBP and TLDP</ulink> on Tuesday last week.  Barbara and our own Guylhem Aznar have put their heads together and the first result is the presentation of the Linux Brochure Project.</para>
<para>Initially developed as a way for printing a flyer for the Victoria Linux User Group, LBP soon became a registered project at <ulink url="http://lbproject.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</ulink>.  <ulink url="http://lbproject.sourceforge.net/examples.html">Various examples</ulink> for US Letter and A4 paper sizes are available.</para>
<para>Greg Ferguson <ulink url="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:6863:200403:ejilbecjpnmoeooninhc">proposed various ways of cooperation</ulink> between our two projects, upon which Barbara explained about the LBP toolchain and the need for converting the current LateX-based system into something DocBook-compatible.</para>

<title>Erratum Interview with Fred Stutzman</title>

<para>Because of problems with the convertion of the TLDP Weekly News source XML to RSS feed, the <ulink url="http://tldp.org/ldpwn/20040324.xml#interview">interview with Fred Stutzman</ulink> last week was not spread through our RSS feed.  The problem has been corrected and future interviews will be included in the RSS feed.</para>
<para>If you've missed this or any other interview, discussion topic or news item, don't dispair.  You can always <ulink url="http://tldp.org/ldpwn/">catch up on TLDP Weekly News issues</ulink> browsing our archive.</para>

<title>No second TLDP CD-ROM distro</title>

<para>Bradley Glonka reminded us of the fact that his offer to bring out a TLDP CD-ROM is still standing.  He proposed to publish on demand through <ulink url="http://linuxcentral.com">LinuxCentral</ulink>, who are also hosting a <ulink url="http://linuxcentral.com/linux/LDP/">TLDP mirror</ulinl>, and donate part of the revenue to TLDP.  However, Greg argued that <ulink url="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:6873:200403:fpppcopimljgjpbfaoin">there is no need for a second CD provider</ulink> and advises that TLDP sticks to the <ulink url="http://www.embeddedlogic.com/ELSweb/LDPCD_info.html">CD offered by Embedded Logic Systems</ulink>.</para>

<title>De gustibus et coloribus non disputandum</title>

<para>The Romans knew it already 2000 years ago: don't discuss colour nor taste.  The discussion about a possible new style for TLDP continues.  While author input about their favorite colours is being waved away with the remark that <quote>DocBook enables authors to concentrate on content, they should not worry about formatting and display</quote>, some are concerned about how their documents will look, especially if an <quote>average</quote> colour is chosen.  As <ulink url="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:6878:200403:apjpihhbjhmiefimbdpl">David Horton suggests</ulink>, the only way out of this thread might well be to concentrate on how a document look in plain black-and-white.</para>
