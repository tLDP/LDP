<listitem><para>Our German friends translated the <ulink url="http://www.linuxhaven.de/dlhp/HOWTO/DE-LVM-HOWTO.html">LVM HOWTO</ulink> a while ago, appearantly, but it only got announced on the Deutsches Linux HOWTO Projekt homepage <ulink url="http://www.linuxhaven.de/dlhp/news.html">last week</ulink>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>We decided to support Sergiusz Pawlowicz's proposal for a <ulink url="http://tldp.org/ldpwn/latest.html#AEN63">HOWTO stand up and turn off TV</ulink>.  We would like this document to be a joined effort, and since you've had some time to think about it, we gatter that by now you probably have to refrain yourselves from picking up the telephone and calling us to share your ideas ;-)

<title>Submitted for review</title>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Armin asks if anyone can use his <ulink url="http://qwuh.no-ip.com/oracle/">Oracle 6i Forms and Reports Server and Client HOWTO</ulink>.  Have a look and let him know!</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Daniel Nofftz submitted v1.1.0 of his <ulink url="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?5:mss:5977:200310:laeldocdpphcbljhombk">Athlon Powersaving HOWTO</ulink>, but asks to bear with him until it has been reviewed.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Clemens Lee submitted the first version of the <ulink url="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?5:mss:5986:200310:ekpomcffjchcfdnmmlci">Debian Binary Package Building HOWTO</ulink>, which explains how to create <filename>.deb</filename> packages.  However, he's not happy with the title and awaits suggestions to change it.  This is the chance for those readers who are always sighing how they can't contribute anything to Open Source because they're just not the technical kind of person.  You don't have to know anything about Linux in order to help TLDP authors to create good documents.  Sometimes it's enough to just come up with a bit of inspiration for a good title!</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Miroslav Skoric sent in <ulink url="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?5:mss:5997:200310:akfanghehooklaknddfk">several updates</ulink>: he is the author of the <ulink url="http://www.ibiblio.org/mdw/HOWTO/FBB.html">FBB Packet Radio mini-HOWTO</ulink>, the <ulink url="http://www.ibiblio.org/mdw/HOWTO/LILO.html">LILO mini-HOWTO</ulink> and the <ulink url="http://www.ibiblio.org/mdw/HOWTO/Linux+WinNT.html">Linux+WinNT mini-HOWTO</ulink>.  Don't mix up that last one with Bernd Reichert's <ulink url="http://www.ibiblio.org/mdw/HOWTO/Linux+NT-Loader.html">NT OS Loader + Linux mini-HOWTO</ulink>!</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>From Ian Ward we received for review the <ulink url="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?5:mss:6001:200310:lgilnlolmnaihmeogdcl">Debian and Windows Shared Printing mini-HOWTO</ulink>, v1.2.</para></listitem>
