# Regular cron jobs for the Lampadas documentation system
#
# This probably won't go in the actual release, but is convenient
# when running the test server. It keeps the static site up to
# date with the contents of the CVS tree.
#
# FIXME: Cron won't take environment variables, so I had to put
# hard coded dirs on the demo server. Surely the must be a
# way to make it work like this?

# FIXME: This is a Debian-specific crontab format.
# Will somebody with another type of system also put in the correct
# entries for their system?
