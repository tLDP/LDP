This package provides an extension of CVSFile. It adds Plone
interfaces so it can be used in a Plone system like any other
Plone content.

This product is based on software developed by Ariel Partners LLC
(http://www.arielpartners.com)for use in the Z Object Publishing Environment
(http://www.zope.org).

It does not contain any of Ariel Partners LLC's CVSFile code.
(It actually does have their fish.gif and dtml for now,
but only until I replace them with my own stuff.)
