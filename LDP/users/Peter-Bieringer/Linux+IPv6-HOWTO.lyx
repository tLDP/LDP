\begin_layout Abstract
The goal of the Linux IPv6 HOWTO is to answer both basic and advanced questions
 about IPv6 on the Linux operating system.
 This HOWTO will provide the reader with enough information to install,
 configure, and use IPv6 applications on Linux machines.
 Intermediate releases of this HOWTO are available at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url

\begin_layout Standard
Translations always have to contain the URL, version number and copyright
 of the original document (but yours, too).
 Pls.
 don't translate the original changelog, this is not very useful - also
 do not translate the full section about available translations, can be
 run out-of-date, add an URL to this section here in the English howto.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looks like the document's change frequency is mostly less than once per
 month.
 Since version 0.27 it looks like that most of the content contributed by
 me has been written.
 Translations always have to use the English version as source.

\begin_layout Standard
Because the HTML pages are generated out of the SGML file, the HTML filenames
 turn out to be quite random.
 However, some pages are tagged in LyX, resulting in static names.
 These tags are useful for references and shouldn't be changed in the future.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Linux IPv6 HOWTO (this document)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "IPv6 & Linux - HowTo"
target "http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/"

\end_inset

 is written in pure HTML it's not really compatible with the 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "The Linux Documentation Project (TLDP)"
target "http://www.tldp.org/"

\end_inset

.
 I (
\emph on
Peter Bieringer
\emph default
) got a request in late November 2001 to rewrite the 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "IPv6 & Linux - HowTo"
target "http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/"

\end_inset

 in SGML.
 However, because of the discontinuation of that HOWTO (
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "Future of IPv6 & Linux - HowTo"
target "http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/IPv6-HOWTO/IPv6-HOWTO-0.html#history"

\end_inset

), and as IPv6 is becoming more and more standard, I decided to write a
 new  document covering basic and advanced issues which will remain important
 over the next few years.
 More dynamic and some advanced content will be still found further on in
 the second HOWTO (
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "IPv6 & Linux - HowTo"
target "http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/"

\end_inset

What is IPv6?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IPv6 is a new layer 3 protocol
\color none
 which will supersede IPv4 (also known as IP).
 IPv4 was designed long time ago (
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "RFC 760 / Internet Protocol"
target "http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc760.html"

\end_inset

 from January 1980) and since its inception, there have been many requests
 for more addresses and enhanced capabilities.
 Latest RFC is 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "RFC 2460 / Internet Protocol Version 6 Specification"
target "http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2460.html"

\end_inset

.
 Major changes in IPv6 are the redesign of the header, including the increase
 of address size from 32 bits to 128 bits.
 Because layer 3 is responsible for end-to-end packet transport using packet
 routing based on addresses, it must include the new IPv6 addresses (source
 and destination), like IPv4.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For more information about the IPv6 history take a look at older IPv6 related
 RFCs listed e.g.

, whose aim was to implement all missing, or outdated IPv6 support in Linux.
 It tracks the current IPv6 implementation in FreeBSD made by the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What do IPv6 addresses look like?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
As previously mentioned, IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long.
 This number of bits generates very high decimal numbers with up to 39 digits:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2^128-1: 340282366920938463463374607431768211455
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
Such numbers are not really addresses that can be memorized.
 Also the IPv6 address schema is bitwise orientated (just like IPv4, but
 that's not often recognized).
 Therefore a better notation of such big numbers is hexadecimal.
 In hexadecimal, 4 bits (also known as 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

nibble
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

) are represented by a digit or character from 0-9 and a-f (10-15).
 This format reduces the length of the IPv6 address to 32 characters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2^128-1: 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
This representation is still not very convenient (possible mix-up or loss
 of single hexadecimal digits), so the designers of IPv6 chose a hexadecimal
 format with a colon as separator after each block of 16 bits.
 In addition, the leading "
\family typewriter
0x
\family default
" (a signifier for hexadecimal values used in programming languages) is
 removed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2^128-1: ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
A usable address (see address types later) is e.g.: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2001:0db8:0100:f101:0210:a4ff:fee3:9566
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
For simplifications, leading zeros of each 16 bit block can be omitted:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2001:0db8:0100:f101:0210:a4ff:fee3:9566  -> 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code

FAQ (Basics)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Why is the name IPv6 and not IPv5 as successor for IPv4?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
On any IP header, the first 4 bits are reserved for protocol version.
 So theoretically a protocol number between 0 and 15 is possible:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\align left
4: is already used for IPv4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\align left
5: is reserved for the Stream Protocol (STP, 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
The next free number was 6.
 Hence IPv6 was born!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
IPv6 addresses: why such a high number of bits?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
During the design of IPv4, people thought that 32 bits were enough for the
 world.
 Looking back into the past, 32 bits were enough until now and will perhaps
 be enough for another few years.
 However, 32 bits are not enough to provide each network device with a global
 address in the future.
 Think about mobile phones, cars (including electronic devices on its CAN-bus),
 toasters, refrigerators, light switches, and so on...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
So designers have chosen 128 bits, 4 times more in length than in IPv4 today.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The usable size is smaller than it may appear however.
 This is because in the currently defined address schema, 64 bits are used
 for interface identifiers.
 The other 64 bits are used for routing.
 Assuming the current strict levels of aggregation (/48, /32, ...), it is still
 possible to 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

run out
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

 of space, but hopefully not in the near future.

\begin_layout Subsection
IPv6 addresses: why so small a number of bits on a new design?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
While, there are (possibly) some people (only know about Jim Fleming...) on
 the Internet who are thinking about IPv8 and IPv16, their design is far
 away from acceptance and implementation.
 In the meantime 128 bits was the best choice regarding header overhead
 and data transport.
 Consider the minimum Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) in IPv4 (576 octets) and
 in IPv6 (1280 octets), the header length in IPv4 is 20 octets (minimum,
 can increase to 60 octets with IPv4 options) and in IPv6 is 48 octets (fixed).
 This is 3.4 % of MTU in IPv4 and 3.8 % of MTU in IPv6.
 This means the header overhead is almost equal.
 More bits for addresses would require bigger headers and therefore more
 overhead.
 Also, consider the maximum MTU on normal links (like Ethernet today): it's
 1500 octets (in special cases: 9k octets using Jumbo frames).
 Ultimately, it wouldn't be a proper design if 10 % or 20 % of transported
 data in a Layer-3 packet were used for addresses and not for payload.

Address types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like IPv4, IPv6 addresses can be split into network and host parts using
 subnet masks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IPv4 has shown that sometimes it would be nice, if more than one IP address
 can be assigned to an interface, each for a different purpose (aliases,
 multi-cast).
 To remain extensible in the future, IPv6 is going further and allows more
 than one IPv6 address to be assigned to an interface.
 There is currently no limit defined by an RFC, only in the implementation
 of the IPv6 stack (to prevent DoS attacks).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using this large number of bits for addresses, IPv6 defines address types
 based on some leading bits, which are hopefully never going to be broken
 in the future (unlike IPv4 today and the history of class A, B, and C).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
Also the number of bits are separated into a network part (upper 64 bits)
 and a host part (lower 64 bits), to facilitate auto-configuration.

Example:

A special 6bone test address which will never be globally unique begins
 with 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
3ffe:ffff: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and is mostly shown in older examples.
 The reason for this is, if real addresses are are shown, it's possible
 for someone to do a copy & paste to their configuration files, thus inadvertent
ly causing duplicates on a globally unique address.
 This would cause serious problems for the original host (e.g.
 getting answer packets for request that were never sent).
\newline
Because IPv6 is
 now in production, this prefix is no longer be delegated and is removed
 from routing after 6.6.2006 (see

Multicast scopes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multicast scope is a parameter to specify the maximum distance a multicast
 packet can travel from the sending entity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, the following regions (scopes) are defined:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ffx1: node-local, packets never leave the node.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ffx2: link-local, packets are never forwarded by routers, so they never
 leave the specified link.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ffx5: site-local, packets never leave the site.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ffx8: organization-local, packets never leave the organization (not so easy
 to implement, must be covered by routing protocol).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ffxe: global scope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
others are reserved
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Multicast types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many types already defined/reserved (see 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "RFC 4291 / IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"
target "http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc4291.html"

\end_inset

 for details).
 Some examples are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All Nodes Address: ID = 1h, addresses all hosts on the local node (ff01:0:0:0:0:
0:0:1) or the connected link (ff02:0:0:0:0:0:0:1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All Routers Address: ID = 2h, addresses all routers on the local node (ff01:0:0:
0:0:0:0:2), on the connected link (ff02:0:0:0:0:0:0:2), or on the local
 site (ff05:0:0:0:0:0:0:2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Solicited node link-local multicast address
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Special multicast address used as destination address in neighborhood discovery,
 because unlike in IPv4, ARP no longer exists in IPv6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example of this address looks like
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
ff02::1:ff00:1234
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Used prefix shows that this is a link-local multicast address.
 The suffix is generated from the destination address.
 In this example, a packet should be sent to address 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fe80::1234
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but the network stack doesn't know the current layer 2 MAC address.
 It replaces the upper 104 bits with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ff02:0:0:0:0:1:ff00::/104
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and leaves the lower 24 bits untouched.
 This address is now used `on-link' to find the corresponding node which
 has to send a reply containing its layer 2 MAC address.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Anycast addresses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anycast addresses are special addresses and are used to cover things like
 nearest DNS server, nearest DHCP server, or similar dynamic groups.
 Addresses are taken out of the unicast address space (aggregatable global
 or site-local at the moment).
 The anycast mechanism (client view) will be handled by dynamic routing
 protocols.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: Anycast addresses cannot be used as source addresses, they are only
 used as destination addresses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Subnet-router anycast address
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A simple example for an anycast address is the subnet-router anycast address.
 Assuming that a node has the following global assigned IPv6 address:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2001:db8:100:f101:210:a4ff:fee3:9566/64  <- Node's address
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The subnet-router anycast address will be created blanking the suffix (least
 significant 64 bits) completely:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2001:db8:100:f101::/64  <- subnet-router anycast address
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Address types (host part)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
For auto-configuration and mobility issues, it was decided to use the lower
 64 bits as the host part of the address in most of the current address
 types.
 Therefore each single subnet can hold a large amount of addresses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
This host part can be inspected differently: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Automatically computed (also known as stateless)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With auto-configuration, the host part of the address is computed by converting
 the MAC address of an interface (if available), with the EUI-64 method,
 to a unique IPv6 address.
 If no MAC address is available for this device (happens e.g.
 on virtual devices), something else (like the IPv4 address or the MAC address
 of a physical interface) is used instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
E.g.
 a NIC has following MAC address (48 bit):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
00:10:A4:E3:95:66
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
This would be expanded according to the
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "IEEE-Tutorial EUI-64"
target "http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/tutorials/EUI64.html"

\end_inset

 design for EUI-48 identifiers to the 64 bit interface identifier:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
0210:a4ff:fee3:9566
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
With a given prefix, the result is the IPv6 address shown in example above:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2001:0db8:0100:f101:0210:a4ff:fee3:9566
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Privacy problem with automatically computed addresses and a solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
Because the "automatically computed" host part is globally unique (except
 when a vendor of a NIC uses the same MAC address on more than one NIC),
 client tracking is possible on the host when not using a proxy of any kind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
This is a known problem, and a solution was defined: privacy extension,
 defined in 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "RFC 3041 / Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6"
target "http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3041.html"

\end_inset

 (there is also already a newer draft available: 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "draft-ietf-ipv6-privacy-addrs-v2-*"
target "http://www.ietf.org/ids.by.wg/ipv6.html"

\end_inset

).
 Using a random and a static value a new suffix is generated from time to
 time.
 Note: this is only reasonable for outgoing client connections and isn't
 really useful for well-known servers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Manually set
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For servers, it's probably easier to remember simpler addresses, this can
 also be accommodated.
 It is possible to assign an additional IPv6 address to an interface, e.g.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2001:0db8:100:f101::1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For manual suffixes like 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

::1
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

 shown in the above example, it's required that the 7th most significant
 bit is set to 0 (the universal/local bit of the automatically generated
 identifier).
 Also some other (otherwise unchosen ) bit combinations are reserved for
 anycast addresses, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Prefix lengths for routing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the early design phase it was planned to use a fully hierarchical routing
 approach to reduce the size of the routing tables maximally.
 The reasons behind this approach were the number of current IPv4 routing
 entries in core routers (> 104 thousand in May 2001), reducing the need
 of memory in hardware routers (ASIC 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

Application Specified Integrated Circuit
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

 driven) to hold the routing table and increase speed (fewer entries hopefully
 result in faster lookups).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
Todays view is that routing will be mostly hierarchically designed for networks
 with only one service provider.
 With more than one ISP connections, this is not possible, and subject to
 an issue named multi-homing (infos on multi-homing: 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "drafts-ietf-multi6-*"

\end_inset

,

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Prefix lengths (also known as "netmasks")
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
Similar to IPv4, the routable network path for routing to take place.
 Because standard netmask notation for 128 bits doesn't look nice, designers
 employed the IPv4 Classless Inter Domain Routing (CIDR, 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "RFC 1519 / Classless Inter-Domain Routing"
target "http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1519.html"

\end_inset

) scheme, which specifies the number of bits of the IP address to be used
 for routing.
 It is also called the "slash" notation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
An example: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2001:0db8:100:1:2:3:4:5/48
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
This notation will be expanded:

Netmask:

\begin_layout Code
ffff:ffff:ffff:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Matching a route
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under normal circumstances (no QoS), a lookup in a routing table results
 in the route with the most significant number of address bits being selected.
 In other words, the route with the biggest prefix length matches first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example if a routing table shows following entries (list is not complete):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2001:0db8:100::/48     ::            U  1 0 0 sit1 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2000::/3               ::192.88.99.1 UG 1 0 0 tun6to4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shown destination addresses of IPv6 packets will be routed through shown
 device
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2001:0db8:100:1:2:3:4:5/48  ->  routed through device sit1

IPv6-ready kernel
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Modern Linux distributions already contain IPv6-ready kernels, the IPv6
 capability is generally compiled as a module, but it's possible that this
 module is not loaded automatically on startup.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Note: you shouldn't anymore use kernel series 2.2.x, because it's not IPv6-up-to-d
ate anymore.
 Also the IPv6 support in series 2.4.x is no longer improved according to
 definitions in latest RFCs.
 It's recommend to use series 2.6.x now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Check for IPv6 support in the current running kernel
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
To check, whether your current running kernel supports IPv6, take a look
 into your 
\family typewriter

\family default
-file-system.
 Following entry must exists: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
/proc/net/if_inet6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
A short automatical test looks like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# test -f /proc/net/if_inet6 && echo "Running kernel is IPv6 ready"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
If this fails, it is quite likely, that the IPv6 module is not loaded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Try to load IPv6 module
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
You can try to load the IPv6 module executing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# modprobe ipv6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
If this is successful, this module should be listed, testable with following
 auto-magically line:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# lsmod |grep -w 'ipv6' && echo "IPv6 module successfully loaded"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
And the check shown above should now run successfully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: unloading the module is currently not supported and can result, under
 some circumstances, in a kernel crash.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Automatically loading of module
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Its possible to automatically load the IPv6 module on demand.
 You only have to add following line in the configuration file of the kernel
 module loader (normally /etc/modules.conf or /etc/conf.modules):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
alias net-pf-10 ipv6  # automatically load IPv6 module on demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's also possible to disable automatically loading of the IPv6 module using
 following line
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
alias net-pf-10 off   # disable automatically load of IPv6 module on demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additional note: in kernels series 2.6.x, the module loader mechanism was
 changed.
 The new configuration file has to be named /etc/modprobe.conf instead of
 /etc/modules.conf.

\begin_layout Standard
A major issue is that because of the network layer structure of kernel implement
ation an IPv6 packet isn't really recognized by it's IP header number (6
 instead of 4).
 It's recognized by the protocol number of the Layer 2 transport protocol.
 Therefore any transport protocol which doesn't use such protocol number
 cannot dispatch IPv6 packets.
 Note: the packet is still transported over the link, but on receivers side,
 the dispatching won't work (you can see this e.g.
 using tcpdump).

Alexey N.
 Kuznetsov (current a maintainer of the Linux networking code) created a
 tool-set which configures networks through the netlink device.
 Using this tool-set you have more functionality than net-tools provides,
 but its not very well documented and isn't for the faint of heart.

If the program /sbin/ip isn't found, then I strongly recommend you install
 the iproute package.

After you have prepared your system for IPv6, you now want to use IPv6 for
 network communications.
 First you should learn how to examine IPv6 packets with a sniffer program.
 This is strongly recommended because for debugging/troubleshooting issues
 this can aide in providing a diagnosis very quickly.

IPv6 ping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This program is normally included in package

.
 It is designed for simple transport tests sending ICMPv6 echo-request packets
 and wait for ICMPv6 echo-reply packets.
\end_layout

# ping6 <hostwithipv6address>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ping6 <ipv6address>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ping6 [-I <device>] <link-local-ipv6address>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ping6 -c 1 ::1 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
PING ::1(::1) from ::1 : 56 data bytes 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hint: ping6 needs raw access to socket and therefore root permissions.
 So if non-root users cannot use ping6 then there are two possible problems:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
ping6 is not in users path (probably, because ping6 is generally stored
 in /usr/sbin -> add path (not really recommended)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
ping6 doesn't execute properly, generally because of missing root permissions
 -> chmod u+s /usr/sbin/ping6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Specifying interface for IPv6 ping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using link-local addresses for an IPv6 ping, the kernel does not know through
 which (physically or virtual) device it must send the packet - each device
 has a link-local address.
 A try will result in following error message:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ping6 fe80::212:34ff:fe12:3456 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
connect: Invalid argument
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case you have to specify the interface additionally like shown here:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ping6 -I eth0 -c 1 fe80::2e0:18ff:fe90:9205 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Ping6 to multicast addresses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An interesting mechanism to detect IPv6-active hosts on a link is to ping6
 to the link-local all-node multicast address:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ping6 -I eth0 ff02::1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
PING ff02::1(ff02::1) from fe80:::2ab:cdff:feef:0123 eth0: 56 data bytes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
64 bytes from ::1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.104 ms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
64 bytes from fe80::212:34ff:fe12:3450: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.549 ms (DUP!)
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike in IPv4, where replies to a ping on the broadcast address can be
 disabled, in IPv6 currently this behavior cannot be disable except by local
 IPv6 firewalling.

Note: unlike some modern versions of IPv4 traceroute, which can use ICMPv4
 echo-request packets as well as UDP packets (default), current IPv6-traceroute
 is only able to send UDP packets.
 As you perhaps already know, ICMP echo-request packets are more accepted
 by firewalls or ACLs on routers inbetween than UDP packets.

On Linux, tcpdump is the major tool for packet capturing.
 Below you find some examples.
 IPv6 support is normally built-in in current releases of version 3.6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
tcpdump uses expressions for filtering packets to minimize the noise:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Itemize
ip6: filters native IPv6 traffic (including ICMPv6)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
not port ssh: to suppress displaying SSH packets for running tcpdump in
 a remote SSH session
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also some command line options are very useful to catch and print more informati
on in a packet, mostly interesting for digging into ICMPv6 packets:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 A simple test whether the used system can resolve IPv6 addresses is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FP and TLA together (16 bits) have the value 0x2002.
 V4ADDR is the node's global unique IPv4 address (in hexadecimal notation).
 SLA is the subnet identifier (65536 local subnets possible) and are usable
 to represent your local network structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For gateways, such prefix is generated by normally using SLA

\begin_layout Standard
The downstream (6bone -> your 6to4 enabled node) is not really fix and can
 vary from foreign host which originated packets were send to.
 There exist two possibilities:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Foreign host uses 6to4 and sends packet direct back to your node (see below)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Foreign host sends packets back to the world-wide IPv6 network and depending
 on the dynamic routing a relay router create a automatic tunnel back to
 your node.
\end_layout

 kernel series 2.2.x (see 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref

 for more information).
 Also note that that the prefix length for a 6to4 address is 16 because
 of from network point of view, all other 6to4 enabled hosts are on the
 same layer 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Add a 6to4 tunnel
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, you have to calculate your 6to4 prefix using your local assigned
 global routable IPv4 address (if your host has no global routable IPv4
 address, in special cases NAT on border gateways is possible):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming your IPv4 address is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
1.2.3.4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
the generated 6to4 prefix will be
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2002:0102:0304::
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Local 6to4 gateways should (but it's not a must, you can choose an arbitrary
 suffix with local-scope, if you feel better) always assigned the suffix
 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

::1
\begin_inset Quotes srd

, therefore your local 6to4 address will be
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2002:0102:0304::1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use e.g.
 following for automatic generation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
ipv4="1.2.3.4"; printf "2002:%02x%02x:%02x%02x::1" `echo $ipv4 | tr "." " "`

 has a different meaning here
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
conf/all/forwarding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Type: BOOLEAN
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This enables global IPv6 forwarding between all interfaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In IPv6 you can't control forwarding per device, forwarding control has
 to be done using IPv6-netfilter (controlled with ip6tables) rulesets and
 specify input and output devices (see 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
name "Firewalling/Netfilter6"
reference "firewalling-netfilter6"

\end_inset

 for more).
 This is different to IPv4, where you are able to control forwarding per
 device (decision is made on interface where packet came in).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This also sets all interfaces' Host/Router setting 'forwarding' to the specified
 value.
 See below for details.
 This referred to as global forwarding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If this value is 0, no IPv6 forwarding is enabled, packets never leave another
 interface, neither physical nor logical like e.g.
 tunnels.

\begin_layout Standard
Note: It is recommended to have the same setting on all interfaces; mixed

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Value FALSE: By default, Host behaviour is assumed.
 This means:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
IsRouter flag is not set in Neighbour Advertisements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Router Solicitations are being sent when necessary.

Support for persistent IPv6 configuration in Linux distributions

Some Linux distribution contain already support of a persistent IPv6 configurati
on using existing or new configuration and script files and some hook in

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since starting writing the 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "IPv6 & Linux - HowTo"
target "http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/"

\end_inset

 it was my intention to enable a persistent IPv6 configuration which catch
 most of the wished cases like host-only, router-only, dual-homed-host,
 router with second stub network, normal tunnels, 6to4 tunnels, and so on.
 Nowadays there exists a set of configuration and script files which do
 the job very well (never heard about real problems, but I don't know how
 many use the set).
 Because this configuration and script files are extended from time to time,
 they got their own homepage: 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "initscripts-ipv6 homepage"
target "http://www.deepspace6.net/projects/initscripts-ipv6.html"

\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "Mirror"
target "http://mirrors.bieringer.de/www.deepspace6.net/projects/initscripts-ipv6.html"

\end_inset

).
 Because I began my IPv6 experience using a Red Hat Linux 5.0 clone, my IPv6
 development systems are mostly Red Hat Linux based now, it's kind a logic
 that the scripts are developed for this kind of distribution (so called
 
\emph on
historic issue
\emph default
).
 Also it was very easy to extend some configuration files, create new ones
 and create some simple hook for calling IPv6 setup during IPv4 setup.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fortunately, in Red Hat Linux since 7.1 a snapshot of my IPv6 scripts is
 included, this was and is still further on assisted by Pekka Savola.

Test for IPv6 support of network configuration scripts

You can test, whether your Linux distribution contain support for persistent
 IPv6 configuration using my set.
 Following script library should exist:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/network-functions-ipv6

# test -f /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/network-functions-ipv6 && echo
 "Main
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
¬ IPv6 script library exists"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The version of the library is important if you miss some features.
 You can get it executing following (or easier look at the top of the file):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# source /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/network-functions-ipv6 &&

Firewalling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IPv6 firewalling is important, especially if using IPv6 on internal networks
 with global IPv6 addresses.
 Because unlike at IPv4 networks where in common internal hosts are protected
 automatically using private IPv4 addresses like 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "RFC 1918 / Address Allocation for Private Internets"
target "http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1918.html"

 or Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "Google search for Microsoft + APIPA"
target "http://www.google.com/search?q=apipa+microsoft"

\end_inset

, in IPv6 normally global addresses are used and someone with IPv6 connectivity
 can reach all internal IPv6 enabled nodes.

Firewalling using netfilter6 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Native IPv6 firewalling is only supported in kernel versions 2.4+.
 In older 2.2- you can only filter IPv6-in-IPv4 by protocol 41.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Attention: no warranty that described rules or examples can really protect
 your system! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Enable connection tracking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since kernel version 2.6.20 IPv6 connection tracking is well supported and
 should be used instead of using stateless filter rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ip6tables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Allow ICMPv6
\end_layout

 be specified
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ip6tables -A OUTPUT -o sit+ -p icmpv6 -j ACCEPT 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Newer kernels allow specifying of ICMPv6 types:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ip6tables -A INPUT -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type echo-request -j ACCEPT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Rate-limiting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because it can happen (author already saw it to times) that an ICMPv6 storm
 will raise up, you should use available rate limiting for at least ICMPv6
 ruleset.
 In addition logging rules should also get rate limiting to prevent DoS
 attacks against syslog and storage of log file partition.
 An example for a rate limited ICMPv6 looks like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ip6tables -A INPUT --protocol icmpv6 --icmpv6-type echo-request
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
¬ -j ACCEPT --match limit --limit 30/minute

\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ip6tables -A INPUT -i sit+ -p tcp -s 2001:0db8:100::1/128 --sport 512:65535
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
¬ --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
¬ --sport 22 ! --syn -j ACCEPT 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Enable tunneled IPv6-in-IPv4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To accept tunneled IPv6-in-IPv4 packets, you have to insert rules in your
 
\series bold
IPv4 firewall setup
\series default
 relating to such packets, for example 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Accept incoming IPv6-in-IPv4 on interface ppp0 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# iptables -A INPUT -i ppp0 -p ipv6 -j ACCEPT 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Allow outgoing IPv6-in-IPv4 to interface ppp0 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# iptables -A OUTPUT -o ppp0 -p ipv6 -j ACCEPT 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have only a static tunnel, you can specify the IPv4 addresses, too,
 like 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Accept incoming IPv6-in-IPv4 on interface ppp0 from tunnel endpoint 192.0.2.2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# iptables -A INPUT -i ppp0 -p ipv6 -s 192.0.2.2 -j ACCEPT 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Allow outgoing IPv6-in-IPv4 to interface ppp0 to tunnel endpoint 1.2.3.4 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# iptables -A OUTPUT -o ppp0 -p ipv6 -d 192.0.2.2 -j ACCEPT 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Protection against incoming TCP connection requests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
VERY RECOMMENDED!
\series default
 For security issues you should really insert a rule which blocks incoming
 TCP connection requests.
 Adapt "-i" option, if other interface names are in use! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Block incoming TCP connection requests to this host 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ip6tables -I INPUT -i sit+ -p tcp --syn -j DROP 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Block incoming TCP connection requests to hosts behind this router 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ip6tables -I FORWARD -i sit+ -p tcp --syn -j DROP 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps the rules have to be placed below others, but that is work you have
 to think about it.
 Best way is to create a script and execute rules in a specified way.

\begin_layout Standard

ALSO RECOMMENDED!
\series default
 Like mentioned on my firewall information it's possible to control the
 ports on outgoing UDP/TCP sessions.
 So if all of your local IPv6 systems are using local ports e.g.
 from 32768 to 60999 you are able to filter UDP connections also (until
 connection tracking works) like: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Block incoming UDP packets which cannot be responses of outgoing requests
 of this host 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ip6tables -I INPUT -i sit+ -p udp ! --dport 32768:60999 -j DROP 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Block incoming UDP packets which cannot be responses of forwarded requests
 of hosts behind this router 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ip6tables -I FORWARD -i sit+ -p udp ! --dport 32768:60999 -j DROP 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following lines show a simple firewall configuration for Fedora 6 (since
 kernel version 2.6.20).
 It was modfied from the default one (generated by 
\shape italic

) for supporting connection

tracking

 and return the proper ICMPv6 code for rejects.
 Incoming SSH (port 22) connections are allowed.

Encryption and Authentication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike in IPv4, encryption and authentication is a mandatory feature of
 IPv6.
 Those features are normally implemented using IPsec (which can be also
 used by IPv4).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Modes of using encryption and authentication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two modes of encryption and authentication of a connection are possible:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Transport mode
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Transport mode is a real end-to-end connection mode.
 Here, only the payload (usually ICMP, TCP or UDP) is encrypted with their
 particular header, while the IP header is not encrypted (but usually included
 in authentication).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using AES-128 for encryption and SHA1 for authentication, this mode decreases
 the MTU by 42 octets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Tunnel mode
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tunnel mode can be used either for end-to-end or for gateway-to-gateway
 connection modes.
 Here, the complete IP packet is being encrypted and gets a new IP header
 prepended, all together constituing a new IP packet (this mechanism is
 also known as "encapsulation")
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This mode usually decreases the MTU by 40 octets from the MTU of transport
 mode.
 I.e.
 using AES-128 for encryption and SHA1 for authentication 82 octets less
 than the normal MTU.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

\begin_layout Subsection
Support in vanilla Linux kernel 2.4.x
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the time of writing missing in vanilla up to 2.4.28.
 There was an issue about keeping the Linux kernel source free of export/import-
control-laws regarding encryption code.
 This is also one case why 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url

\end_inset

 wasn't included in vanilla source.
 Perhaps a backport from 2.6.x will be done in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Support in vanilla Linux kernel 2.6.x
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Current versions (as time of writing 2.6.9 and upper) support native IPsec
 for IPv4 and IPv6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Implementation was helped by the USAGI project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Automatic key exchange (IKE)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IPsec requires a key exchange of a secret.
 This is mostly done automatically by so called IKE daemons.
 They also handle the authentication of the peers, either by a common known
 secret (so called 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

pre-shared secret
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

) or by RSA keys (which can also be used from X.509 certificates).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, two different IKE daemons are available for Linux, which totally
 differ in configuration and usage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I prefer

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Listening on IPv6 addresses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: unlike in IPv4 current versions doesn't allow to bind a server socket
 to dedicated IPv6 addresses, so only 
\emph on

\emph default

 Because this can be a security issue, check the Access Control List (ACL)
 section below, too!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To enable IPv6 for listening, following options are requested to change

        # sure other options here, too
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
IPv6 enabled Access Control Lists (ACL)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IPv6 enabled ACLs are possible and should be used whenever it's possible.
 An example looks like following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
acl internal-net { 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        127.0.0.1; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        1.2.3.0/24;  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        2001:0db8:100::/56; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        ::1/128; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        ::ffff:1.2.3.4/128; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
};
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
acl ns-internal-net { 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        1.2.3.4;  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        1.2.3.5;  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        2001:0db8:100::4/128; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        2001:0db8:100::5/128; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
};
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This ACLs can be used e.g.
 for queries of clients and transfer zones to secondary name-servers.
 This prevents also your caching name-server to be used from outside using
 IPv6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
options {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        # sure other options here, too
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        listen-on-v6 { none; };
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        allow-query { internal-net; }; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        allow-transfer { ns-internal-net; }; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
};
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's also possible to set the 
\emph on
allow-query 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
allow-transfer
\emph default
 option for most of single zone definitions, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sending queries with dedicated IPv6 address
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This option is not required, but perhaps needed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
query-source-v6 address <ipv6address|*> port <port|*>;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Per zone defined dedicated IPv6 addresses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's also possible to define per zone some IPv6 addresses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Transfer source address 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Transfer source address is used for outgoing zone transfers:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
transfer-source-v6 <ipv6addr|*> [port port];
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Notify source address 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notify source address is used for outgoing notify messages:

Router Advertisement Daemon (radvd)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The router advertisement daemon is very useful on a LAN, if clients should
 be auto-configured.
 The daemon itself should run on the Linux default IPv6 gateway router (it's
 not required that this is also the default IPv4 gateway, so pay attention
 who on your LAN is sending router advertisements).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can specify some information and flags which should be contained in
 the advertisement.
 Common used are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Prefix (needed)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lifetime of the prefix
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Frequency of sending advertisements (optional)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a proper configuration, the daemon sends advertisements through specified
 interfaces and clients are hopefully receive them and auto-magically configure
 addresses with received prefix and the default route.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Configuring radvd
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Simple configuration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Radvd's config file is normally /etc/radvd.conf.
 An simple example looks like following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
interface eth0 { 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        AdvSendAdvert on;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        MinRtrAdvInterval 3; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        MaxRtrAdvInterval 10;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        prefix 2001:0db8:0100:f101::/64 { 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                AdvOnLink on; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                AdvAutonomous on; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                AdvRouterAddr on; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        };
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
};
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This results on client side in
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ip -6 addr show eth0 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
3: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 100 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
    inet6 2001:0db8:100:f101:2e0:12ff:fe34:1234/64 scope global dynamic
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
       valid_lft 2591992sec preferred_lft 604792sec 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
    inet6 fe80::2e0:12ff:fe34:1234/10 scope link
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because no lifetime was defined, a very high value was used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Special 6to4 configuration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Version since 0.6.2pl3 support the automatic (re)-generation of the prefix
 depending on an IPv4 address of a specified interface.
 This can be used to distribute advertisements in a LAN after the 6to4 tunneling
 has changed.
 Mostly used behind a dynamic dial-on-demand Linux router.
 Because of the sure shorter lifetime of such prefix (after each dial-up,
 another prefix is valid), the lifetime configured to minimal values:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
interface eth0 { 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        AdvSendAdvert on;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        MinRtrAdvInterval 3; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        MaxRtrAdvInterval 10;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        prefix 0:0:0:f101::/64 { 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                AdvOnLink off; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                AdvAutonomous on; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                AdvRouterAddr on; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                Base6to4Interface ppp0;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                AdvPreferredLifetime 20; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                AdvValidLifetime 30;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        };
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
};
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This results on client side in (assuming, ppp0 has currently 1.2.3.4 as local
 IPv4 address):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# /sbin/ip -6 addr show eth0 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
3: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 100 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   inet6 2002:0102:0304
\series bold
:
\series default
f101:2e0:12ff:fe34:1234/64 scope global dynamic 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
      valid_lft 22sec preferred_lft 12sec
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   inet6 fe80::2e0:12ff:fe34:1234/10 scope link
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because a small lifetime was defined, such prefix will be thrown away quickly,
 if no related advertisement was received.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additional note: if you do not used special 6to4 support in initscripts,
 you have to setup a special route on the internal interface on the router,
 otherwise you will get some backrouting problems.
 for the example showh here:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# /sbin/ip -6 route add 2002:0102:0304
\series bold
:
\series default
f101::/64 dev eth0 metric 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This route needs to be replaced every time the prefix changes, which is
 the case after a new IPv4 address was assigned to the dial-up interface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Output shows you each advertisement package in readable format.
 You should see your configured values here again, if not, perhaps it's
 not your radvd which sends the advertisement...look for another router on
 the link (and take the LLAddress, which is the MAC address for tracing).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
tcp_wrapper is controlled by two files name /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny.
 For more information see
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
$ man hosts.allow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Example for /etc/hosts.allow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this file, each service which should be positive filtered (means connects

\begin_layout Standard
Note: there are broken implementations around, which uses following broken
 IPv6 network description: [2001:0db8:100:200::/64].
 Hopefully, such versions will be fixed soon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If this node is a more sensible one you can replace the standard line above
 with this one, but this can cause a DoS attack (load of mailer and spool
 directory), if too many connects were made in short time.
 Perhaps a logwatch is better for such issues.

 It describes how to convert IPv4 applications to be IPv6 compatible in
 a protocol-independent way, and describes some of the common 
\bar under
problems
\bar default
 encountered during the conversion along with suggested solutions.
 At the time of this writing, this is the only book of which the author
 is aware that specifically addresses how to program IPv6 applications [since
 writing this section, the author has also become aware of the Porting applicati
ons to IPv6 HowTo by Eva M.

].
 Unfortunately, of the almost 360 pages in the book, maybe 60 are actually
 useful (the chapters mentioned).
 Nevertheless, without the guidance of that book, the author would have
 been unable to perform his job duties or compose this HowTo.
 While most (but certainly not all) of the information in the Hagino book
 is available via the Linux 'man' pages, application programmers will save
 a significant amount of time and frustration by reading the indicated chapters
 of the book rather than searching through the 'man' pages and online documentat
ion.

Other than the Hagino book, any other information presented in this HowTo

 in the grand IPv6 scheme, but seem to work in practical application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discussion that follows assumes the reader is already experienced with
 the traditional TCP/IP socket API.
 For more information on traditional socket programming, the Internetworking
 with TCP/IP series of textbooks by Comer & Stevens is hard to beat, specificall
y Volume III: Client-Server Programming and Applications, Linux/POSIX Sockets
 Version (ISBN 0-13-032071-4).
 This HowTo also assumes that the reader has had at least a bare basic introduct
ion to IPv6 and in particular the addressing scheme for network addresses
 (see Section 2.3).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Address Structures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section provides a brief overview of the structures provided in the
 socket API to represent network addresses (or more specifically transport
 endpoints) when using the Internet protocols in a client-server application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
IPv4 sockaddr_in
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In IPv4, network addresses are 32 bits long and define a network node.
 Addresses are written in dotted decimal notation, such as 192.0.2.1, where
 each number represents eight bits of the address.
 Such an IPv4 address is represented by the 
\family typewriter
struct sockaddr_in
\family default
 data type, which is defined in 
\family typewriter
<netinet/in.h>
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
struct sockaddr_in
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   sa_family_t    sin_family;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   in_port_t      sin_port;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   struct in_addr sin_addr;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   /* Plus some padding for alignment */
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
};
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
sin_family
\family default
 component indicates the address family.
 For IPv4 addresses, this is always set to 
\family typewriter
AF_INET
\family default
.
 The 
\family typewriter
sin_addr
\family default
 field contains the 32-bit network address (in network byte order).
 Finally, the 
\family typewriter
sin_port
\family default
 component represents the transport layer port number (in network byte order).
 Readers should already be familiar with this structure, as this is the
 standard IPv4 address structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
IPv6 sockaddr_in6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The biggest feature of IPv6 is its increased address space.
 Instead of 32-bit network addresses, IPv6 allots 128 bits to an address.
 Addresses are written in colon-hex notation of the form fe80::2c0:8cff:fe01:234
5, where each hex number separated by colons represents 16 bits of the address.
 Two consecutive colons indicate a string of consecutive zeros for brevity,
 and at most only one double-colon may appear in the address.
 IPv6 addresses are represented by the 
\family typewriter
struct sockaddr_in6
\family default
 data type, also defined in 
\family typewriter
<netinet/in.h>
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
struct sockaddr_in6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   sa_family_t     sin6_family;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   in_port_t       sin6_port;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   uint32_t        sin6_flowinfo;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   struct in6_addr sin6_addr;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   uint32_t        sin6_scope_id;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
};
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
sin6_family
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
sin6_port
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
sin6_addr
\family default
 components of the structure have the same meaning as the corresponding
 fields in the 
\family typewriter
sockaddr_in
\family default
 structure.
 However, the 
\family typewriter
sin6_family
\family default
 member is set to 
\family typewriter
AF_INET6
\family default
 for IPv6 addresses, and the 
\family typewriter
sin6_addr
\family default
 field holds a 128-bit address instead of only 32 bits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
sin6_flowinfo
\family default
 field is used for flow control, but is not yet standardized and can be
 ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
sin6_scope_id
\family default
 field has an odd use, and it seems (at least to this naïve author) that
 the IPv6 designers took a huge step backwards when devising this.
 Apparently, 128-bit IPv6 network addresses are not unique.
 For example, it is possible to have two hosts, on separate networks, with
 the same link-local address (see Figure 1).
 In order to pass information to a specific host, more than just the network
 address is required; the scope identifier must also be specified.
 In Linux, the network interface name is used for the scope identifier (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

eth0
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

) [be warned that the scope identifier is implementation dependent!].
 Use the 
\family typewriter
ifconfig(1M)
\family default
 command to display a list of active network interfaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A colon-hex network address can be augmented with the scope identifier to
 produce a "scoped address
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

.
 The percent sign ('%') is used to delimit the network address from the
 scope identifier.
 For example, 
\family typewriter
fe80::1%eth0
\family default
 is a scoped IPv6 address where 
\family typewriter
fe80::1
\family default
 represents the 128-bit network address and 
\family typewriter
eth0
\family default
 is the network interface (i.e.
 the scope identifier).
 Thus, if a host resides on two networks, such as Host B in example below,
 the user now has to know which path to take in order to get to a particular
 host.
 In Figure 1, Host B addresses Host A using the scoped address 
\family typewriter
fe80::1%eth0
\family default
, while Host C is addressed with 
\family typewriter
fe80::1%eth1
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
Host A (fe80::1) ---- eth0 ---- Host B ---- eth1 ---- Host C (fe80::1)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Getting back to the 
\family typewriter
sockaddr_in6
\family default
 structure, its 
\family typewriter
sin6_scope_id
\family default
 field contains the index of the network interface on which a host may be
 found.
 Server applications will have this field set automatically by the socket
 API when they accept a connection or receive a datagram.
 For client applications, if a scoped address is passed as the node parameter
 to 
\family typewriter
getaddrinfo(3)
\family default
 (described later in this HowTo), then the 
\family typewriter
sin6_scope_id
\family default
 field will be filled in correctly by the system upon return from the function;
 if a scoped address is not supplied, then the sin6_scope_id field must
 be explicitly set by the client software prior to attempting to communicate
 with the remote server.
 The 
\family typewriter
if_nametoindex(3)
\family default
 function is used to translate a network interface name into its corresponding
 index.
 It is declared in 
\family typewriter
<net/if.h>
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Generic Addresses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As any programmer familiar with the traditional TCP/IP socket API knows,
 several socket functions deal with "generic" pointers.
 For example, a pointer to a generic 
\family typewriter
struct sockaddr
\family default
 data type is passed as a parameter to some socket functions (such as 
\family typewriter
connect(2)
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
bind(2)
\family default
) rather than a pointer to a specific address type.
 Be careful\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 the 
\family typewriter
sockaddr_in6
\family default
 structure is larger than the generic 
\family typewriter
sockaddr
\family default
 structure! Thus, if your program 
\bar under
receives
\bar default
 a generic address whose actual type is unknown (e.g.
 it could be an IPv4 address structure or an IPv6 address structure), you
 must supply sufficient storage to hold the entire address.
 The 
\family typewriter
struct sockaddr_storage
\family default
 data type is defined in 
\family typewriter
<bits/socket.h>
\family default
 for this purpose [do not #include this file directly within an application;
 use 
\family typewriter
<sys/socket.h>
\family default
 as usual, and 
\family typewriter
<bits/socket.h>
\family default
 will be implicitly included].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, consider the 
\family typewriter
recvfrom(2)
\family default
 system call, which is used to receive a message from a remote peer.
 Its function prototype is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
ssize_t recvfrom( int              s,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                  void            *buf,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                  size_t           len,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                  int              flags,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                  struct sockaddr *from,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                  socklen_t       *fromlen );
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The from parameter points to a generic 
\family typewriter
sockaddr
\family default
 structure.
 If data can be received from an IPv6 peer on the socket referenced by 
\family typewriter
s
\family default
, then 
\family typewriter
from
\family default
 should point to a data type of 
\family typewriter
struct sockaddr_storage
\family default
, as in the following dummy example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
/*
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
** Read a message from a remote peer, and return a buffer pointer to
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
** the caller.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
**
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
** 's' is the file descriptor for the socket.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
*/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
char *rcvMsg( int s )
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   static char             bfr[ 1025 ];  /* Where the msg is stored.
 */
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   ssize_t                 count;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   struct sockaddr_storage ss;           /* Where the peer adr goes.
 */
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   socklen_t               sslen;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   sslen = sizeof( ss );
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   count = recvfrom( s,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                     bfr,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                     sizeof( bfr ) - 1,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                     0,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                     (struct sockaddr*) &ss,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                     &sslen );
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   bfr[ count ] = '
\backslash
0';   /* Null-terminates the message.
 */
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   return bfr;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
}  /* End rcvMsg() */
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As seen in the above example, 
\family typewriter
ss
\family default
 (a 
\family typewriter
struct sockaddr_storage
\family default
 data object) is used to receive the peer address information, but it's
 address is typecast to a generic 
\family typewriter
struct sockaddr*
\family default
 pointer in the call to 
\family typewriter
recvfrom(2)
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Lookup Functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traditionally, hostname and service name resolution were performed by functions
 such as 
\family typewriter
gethostbyname(3)
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
getservbyname(3)
\family default
.
 These traditional lookup functions are still available, but they are not
 forward compatible to IPv6.
 Instead, the IPv6 socket API provides new lookup functions that consolidate
 the functionality of several traditional functions.
 These new lookup functions are also backward compatible with IPv4, so a
 programmer can use the same translation algorithm in an application for
 both the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.
 This is an important feature, because obviously a global IPv6 infrastructure
 isn't going to be put in place overnight.
 Thus, during the transition period from IPv4 to IPv6, client-server application
s should be designed with the flexibility to handle both protocols simultaneousl
y.
 The example programs at the end of this chapter do just that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary lookup function in the new socket API is 
\family typewriter
getaddrinfo(3)
\family default
.
 Its prototype is as follows.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
int getaddrinfo( const char             *node,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                 const char             *service,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                 const struct addrinfo  *hints,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                 struct addrinfo       **res );
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The node parameter is a pointer to the hostname or IP address being translated.
 The referenced string can be a hostname, IPv4 dotted decimal address, or
 IPv6 colon-hex address (possibly scoped).
 The 
\family typewriter
service
\family default
 parameter is a pointer to the transport layer's service name or port number.
 It can be specified as a name found in 
\family typewriter
/etc/services
\family default
 or a decimal number.
 
\family typewriter
getaddrinfo(3)
\family default
 resolves the host/service combination and returns a 
\bar under
list
\bar default
 of address records; a pointer to the list is placed in the location pointed
 at by 
\family typewriter
res
\family default
.
 For example, suppose a host can be identified by both an IPv4 and IPv6
 address, and that the indicated service has both a TCP entry and UDP entry
 in 
\family typewriter
/etc/services
\family default
.
 In such a scenario, it is not inconceivable that four address records are
 returned; one for TCP/IPv6, one for UDP/IPv6, one for TCP/IPv4, and one
 for UDP/IPv4.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The definition for 
\family typewriter
struct addrinfo
\family default
 is found in 
\family typewriter
<netdb.h>
\family default
 (as is the declaration for getaddrinfo(3) and the other functions described
 in this section).
 The structure has the following format:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
struct addrinfo
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   int              ai_flags;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   int              ai_family;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   int              ai_socktype;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   int              ai_protocol;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   socklen_t        ai_addrlen;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   struct sockaddr *ai_addr;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   char            *ai_canonname;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   struct addrinfo *ai_next;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
};
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consult the 'man' page for 
\family typewriter
getaddrinfo(3)
\family default
 for detailed information about the various fields; this HowTo only describes
 a subset of them, and only to the extent necessary for normal IPv6 programming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
ai_family
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
ai_socktype
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
ai_protocol
\family default
 fields have the exact same meaning as the parameters to the 
\family typewriter
socket(2)
\family default
 system call.
 The 
\family typewriter
ai_family
\family default
 field indicates the 
\bar under
protocol
\bar default
 family (not the address family) associated with the record, and will be
 
\family typewriter
PF_INET6
\family default
 for IPv6 or 
\family typewriter
PF_INET
\family default
 for IPv4.
 The 
\family typewriter
ai_socktype
\family default
 parameter indicates the type of socket to which the record corresponds;
 
\family typewriter
SOCK_STREAM
\family default
 for a reliable connection-oriented byte-stream or 
\family typewriter
SOCK_DGRAM
\family default
 for connectionless communication.
 The 
\family typewriter
ai_protocol
\family default
 field specifies the underlying transport protocol for the record.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
ai_addr
\family default
 field points to a generic 
\family typewriter
struct sockaddr
\family default
 object.
 Depending on the value in the 
\family typewriter
ai_family
\family default
 field, it will point to either a 
\family typewriter
struct sockaddr_in
\family default
 (
\family typewriter
PF_INET
\family default
) or a 
\family typewriter
struct sockaddr_in6
\family default
 (
\family typewriter
PF_INET6
\family default
).
 The 
\family typewriter
ai_addrlen
\family default
 field contains the size of the object pointed at by the 
\family typewriter
ai_addr
\family default
 field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned, 
\family typewriter
getaddrinfo(3)
\family default
 returns a list of address records.
 The 
\family typewriter
ai_next
\family default
 field points to the next record in the list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
hints
\family default
 parameter to 
\family typewriter
getaddrinfo(3)
\family default
 is also of type 
\family typewriter
struct addrinfo
\family default
 and acts as a filter for the address records returned in 
\family typewriter
res
\family default
.
 If 
\family typewriter
hints
\family default
 is 
\family typewriter
NULL
\family default
, all matching records are returned; but if 
\family typewriter
hints
\family default
 is non-
\family typewriter
NULL
\family default
, the referenced structure gives "hints" to 
\family typewriter
getaddrinfo(3)
\family default
 about which records to return.
 Only the 
\family typewriter
ai_flags
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
ai_family
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
ai_socktype
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
ai_protocol
\family default
 fields are significant in the 
\family typewriter
hints
\family default
 structure, and all other fields should be set to zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Programs can use 
\family typewriter
hints->ai_family
\family default
 to specify the protocol family.
 For example, if it is set to 
\family typewriter
PF_INET6
\family default
, then only IPv6 address records are returned.
 Likewise, setting 
\family typewriter
hints->ai_family
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
PF_INET
\family default
 results in only IPv4 address records being returned.
 If an application wants both IPv4 and IPv6 records, the field should be
 set to 
\family typewriter
PF_UNSPEC
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
hints->socktype
\family default
 field can be set to 
\family typewriter
SOCK_STREAM
\family default
 to return only records that correspond to connection-oriented byte streams,
 
\family typewriter
SOCK_DGRAM
\family default
 to return only records corresponding to connectionless communication, or
 
\family typewriter
0
\family default
 to return both.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the Internet protocols, there is only one protocol associated with connectio
n-oriented sockets (TCP) and one protocol associated with connectionless
 sockets (UDP), so setting 
\family typewriter
hints->ai_socktype
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
SOCK_STREAM
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
SOCK_DGRAM
\family default
 is the same as saying, "Give me only TCP records," or "Give me only UDP
 records," respectively.
 With that in mind, the 
\family typewriter
hints->ai_protocol
\family default
 field isn't really that important with the Internet protocols, and pretty
 much mirrors the 
\family typewriter
hints->ai_socktype
\family default
 field.
 Nevertheless, 
\family typewriter
hints->ai_protocol
\family default
 can be set to 
\family typewriter
IPPROTO_TCP
\family default
 to return only TCP records, 
\family typewriter
IPPROTO_UDP
\family default
 to return only UDP records, or 
\family typewriter
0
\family default
 for both.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
node
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
service
\family default
 parameter to 
\family typewriter
gethostbyname(3)
\family default
 can be 
\family typewriter
NULL
\family default
, but not both.
 If 
\family typewriter
node
\family default
 is 
\family typewriter
NULL
\family default
, then the 
\family typewriter
ai_flags field
\family default
 of the 
\family typewriter
hints
\family default
 parameter specifies how the network address in a returned record is set
 (i.e.
 the 
\family typewriter
sin_addr
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
sin6_addr
\family default
 field of the object pointed at by the 
\family typewriter
ai_addr
\family default
 component in a returned record).
 If the 
\family typewriter
AI_PASSIVE
\family default
 flag is set in 
\family typewriter
hints
\family default
, then the returned network addresses are left unresolved (all zeros).
 This is how server applications would use 
\family typewriter
getaddrinfo(3)
\family default
.
 If the flag is not set, then the address is set to the local loopback address
 (::1 for IPv6 or 127.0.0.1 for IPv4).
 This is one way a client application can specify that the target server
 is running on the same machine as the client.
 If the 
\family typewriter
service
\family default
 parameter is 
\family typewriter
NULL
\family default
, the port number in the returned address records remains unresolved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
getaddrinfo(3)
\family default
 function returns zero on success, or an error code.
 In the case of an error, the 
\family typewriter
gai_strerror(3)
\family default
 function is used to obtain a character pointer to an error message correspondin
g to the error code, just like 
\family typewriter
strerror(3)
\family default
 does in the standard 'C' library.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the address list is no longer needed, it must be freed by the application.
 This is done with the 
\family typewriter
freeaddrinfo(3)
\family default
 function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last function that will be mentioned in this section is 
\family typewriter
getnameinfo(3)
\family default
.
 This function is the inverse of 
\family typewriter
getaddrinfo(3)
\family default
; it is used to create a string representation of the hostname and service
 from a generic 
\family typewriter
struct sockaddr
\family default
 data object.
 It has the following prototype.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
int getnameinfo( const struct sockaddr *sa,

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
sa
\family default
 parameter points to the address structure in question, and 
\family typewriter
salen
\family default
 contains its size.
 The 
\family typewriter
host
\family default
 parameter points to a buffer where the null-terminated hostname string
 is placed, and the hostlen parameter is the size of that buffer.
 If there is no hostname that corresponds to the address, then the network
 address (dotted decimal or colon-hex) is placed in 
\family typewriter
host
\family default
.
 Likewise, the 
\family typewriter
serv
\family default
 parameter points to a buffer where the null-terminated service name string
 (or port number) is placed, and the 
\family typewriter
servlen
\family default
 parameter is the size of that buffer.
 The 
\family typewriter
flags
\family default
 parameter modifies the function's behavior; in particular, the 
\family typewriter
NI_NUMERICHOST
\family default
 flag indicates that the converted hostname should always be formatted in
 numeric form (i.e.
 dotted decimal or colon-hex), and the 
\family typewriter
NI_NUMERICSERV
\family default
 flag indicates that the converted service should always be in numeric form
 (i.e.
 the port number).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The symbols 
\family typewriter
NI_MAXHOST
\family default
 and

 are available to applications and represent the maximum size of any converted
 hostname or service name, respectively.
 Use these when declaring output buffers for 
\family typewriter

\begin_layout Subsection
Quirks Encountered
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before jumping into the programming examples, there are several quirks in
 IPv6 of which the reader should be aware.
 The more significant ones (in addition to the non-uniqueness of IPv6 network
 addresses already discussed) are described in the paragraphs below.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
IPv4 Mapped Addresses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For security reasons that this author won't pretend to understand, "IPv4
 mapped addresses" should not be allowed in IPv6-capable server applications.
 To put it in terms that everyone can understand, this simply means that
 a server should not accept IPv4 traffic on an IPv6 socket (an otherwise
 legal operation).
 An IPv4 mapped address is a mixed-format address of the form:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
::ffff:192.0.2.1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where the first portion is in IPv6 colon-hex format and the last portion
 is in IPv4 dotted decimal notation.
 The dotted decimal IPv4 address is the actual network address, but it is
 being mapped into an IPv6 compatible format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To prevent IPv4 mapped addresses from being accepted on an IPv6 socket,
 server applications must explicitly set the 
\family typewriter
IPV6_V6ONLY
\family default
 socket option on all IPv6 sockets created [the Hagino book implies that
 this is only a concern with server applications.
 However, it has been observed during testing that if a client application
 uses an IPv4 mapped address to specify the target server, and the target
 server has IPv4 mapped addresses disabled, the connection still completes
 regardless.
 On the server side, the connection endpoint is an IPv4 socket as desired;
 but on the client side, the connection endpoint is an IPv6 socket.
 Setting the IPV6_V6ONLY socket option on the client side as well as the
 server side prevents any connection from being established at all.].
 There's only one problem.
 Apparently, 
\family typewriter
IPV6_V6ONLY
\family default
 isn't defined on all systems [or at least it wasn't in 2005 when the Hagino
 book was written].
 The server example at the end of this chapter provides a method for handling
 this problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If IPv4 traffic cannot be handled on IPv6 sockets, then that implies that
 server applications must open both an IPv4 and IPv6 socket for a particular
 network service if it wants to handle requests from either protocol.
 This goes back to the flexibility issue mentioned earlier.
 If 
\family typewriter
getaddrinfo(3)
\family default
 returns multiple address records, then server applications should traverse
 the list and open a passive socket for each address provided.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Cannot Specify the Scope Identifier in /etc/hosts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to assign a hostname to an IPv6 network address in 
\family typewriter
/etc/hosts
\family default
.
 For example, the following is an excerpt from the 
\family typewriter
/etc/hosts
\family default
 file on the author's development system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        ::1                        localhost
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        127.0.0.1                  localhost
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        fe80::2c0:8cff:fe01:2345   pt141
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        192.0.2.1                  pt141
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The "localhost" and "pt141" hostnames can be translated to either an IPv4
 or IPv6 network address.
 So, for example, if "pt141" is passed as the node parameter to 
\family typewriter
getaddrinfo(3)
\family default
, the function returns both an IPv4 and IPv6 address record for the host
 (assuming the behavior hasn't been modified by the hints parameter).
 Unfortunately, a scoped address cannot be used in 
\family typewriter
/etc/hosts
\family default
.
 Doing so results in 
\family typewriter
getaddrinfo(3)
\family default
 returning only the IPv4 record.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Client & Server Residing on the Same Machine
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose a machine has the IPv4 address 192.0.2.1.
 A client application running on that machine can connect to a server applicatio
n on the same machine by using either the local loopback address (127.0.0.1)
 or the network address (192.0.2.1) as the target server.
 Much to this author's surprise (and dismay), it turns out that an IPv6
 client application cannot connect to a server application on the same machine
 if it uses the network address of that machine as the target; it must use
 the local loopback address (::1).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Putting It All Together (A Client-Server Programming Example)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now it's time to put everything discussed thus far together into a sample
 client-server application.
 The remainder of this section is devoted to a remote time-of-day application
 (the 'daytime' Internet service) [I noticed that Ms.
 Castro used a 'daytime' example in her 
\emph on
Porting applications to IPv6 HowTo
\emph default
.
 For the record, the source code presented here is original, developed from
 scratch, and any similarity between it and any other publicly available
 'daytime' example is purely coincidental.].
 The source code presented in this section was developed and tested on a
 RedHat Linux release using the 2.6 kernel (2.6.9 to be specific).
 Readers may use the source code freely, so long as proper credit is attributed;
 but of course the standard disclaimer must be given first: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Although the sample source code is believed to be free of errors, the author
 makes no guarantees as to its reliability, especially considering that
 some error paths were intentionally omitted for brevity.
 Use it at your own risk!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you get right down to it, there really aren't that many differences
 between IPv4 and IPv6 applications.
 The trick is to code IPv6 applications in a protocol-independent manner,
 such that they can handle both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously and transparently.
 This sample application does just that.
 The only protocol-dependent code in the example occurs when printing network
 addresses in verbose mode; but only 
\bar under
after
\bar default
 the 
\family typewriter
ai_family field
\family default
 in the 
\family typewriter
addrinfo
\family default
 structure has been checked, so the programs know exactly what type of address
 they're handling at the time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
'Daytime' Server Code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The server code is found in file tod6d.c (time-of-day IPv6 daemon).
 Once built, the server may be started using the following command syntax
 (assuming tod6d is the executable file):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
tod6d [-v] [service]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ARGUMENTS: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
service The service (or well-known port) on which to listen.
 Default is "daytime".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OPTIONS:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-v Turn on verbose mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The server handles both TCP and UDP requests on the network.
 The server source code contained in tod6d.c follows:

'Daytime' TCP Client Code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TCP client code is found in file tod6tc.c (time-of-day IPv6 TCP client).
 Once built, the TCP client may be started using the following command syntax
 (assuming tod6tc is the executable file):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
tod6tc [-v] [-s scope_id] [host [service]]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ARGUMENTS:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
host The hostname or IP address (dotted decimal or colon-hex) of the remote
 host providing the service.
 Default is "localhost".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
service The TCP service (or well-known port number) to which a connection
 attempt is made.
 Default is "daytime".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OPTIONS:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-s This option is only meaningful for IPv6 addresses, and is used to set
 the scope identifier (i.e.
 the network interface on which to establish the connection).
 Default is "eth0".
 If host is a scoped address, this option is ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-v Turn on verbose mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TCP client source code contained in tod6tc.c follows:

'Daytime' UDP Client Code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The UDP client code is found in file tod6uc.c (time-of-day IPv6 UDP client).
 It is almost an exact duplicate of the TCP client (and in fact was derived
 from it), but is included in this HowTo for completeness.
 Once built, the UDP client may be started using the following command syntax
 (assuming tod6uc is the executable file):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
tod6uc [-v] [-s scope_id] [host [service]]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ARGUMENTS:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
host The hostname or IP address (dotted decimal or colon-hex) of the remote
 host providing the service.
 Default is "localhost".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
service The UDP service (or well-known port number) to which datagrams are
 sent.
 Default is "daytime".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OPTIONS:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-s This option is only meaningful for IPv6 addresses, and is used to set
 the scope identifier (i.e.
 the network interface on which to exchange datagrams).
 Default is "eth0".
 If host is a scoped address, this option is ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-v Turn on verbose mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The UDP client source code contained in tod6uc.c follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
/******************************************************************************
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
* File: tod6uc.c
