\begin_layout Abstract
The goal of the Linux IPv6 HOWTO is to answer both basic and advanced questions
 about IPv6 on the Linux operating system.
 This HOWTO will provide the reader with enough information to install,
 configure, and use IPv6 applications on Linux machines.
 Intermediate releases of this HOWTO are available at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[mirrors.bieringer.de]{http://mirrors.bieringer.de/Linux+IPv6-HOWTO/}

\begin_layout Standard
Looks like the document's change frequency is mostly less than once per
 month.
 Since version 0.27 it looks like that most of the content contributed by
 me has been written.

\begin_layout Standard
SGML is generated using export function in LyX.

Also some fixes are have to be made to create proper SGML code (see also

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Dedicated pages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the HTML pages are generated out of the SGML file, the HTML filenames
 turn out to be quite random.
 However, some pages are tagged in LyX, resulting in static names.
 These tags are useful for references and shouldn't be changed in the future.

Linux IPv6 HOWTO (this document)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[IPv6 & Linux - HowTo]{http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/}

\end_inset

 is written in pure HTML it's not really compatible with the 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[The Linux Documentation Project (TLDP)]{http://www.tldp.org/}

\end_inset

.
 I (
\emph on
Peter Bieringer
\emph default
) got a request in late November 2001 to rewrite the 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[IPv6 & Linux - HowTo]{http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/}

\end_inset

 in SGML.
 However, because of the discontinuation of that HOWTO (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[Future of IPv6 & Linux - HowTo]{http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/IPv6-HOWTO/IPv6-HOWTO-0.html#history}

\end_inset

), and as IPv6 is becoming more and more standard, I decided to write a
 new  document covering basic and advanced issues which will remain important
 over the next few years.
 More dynamic and some advanced content will be still found further on in
 the second HOWTO (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[IPv6 & Linux - HowTo]{http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/}

\end_inset

).

\color none
) which will supersede IPv4 (also known as IP).
 IPv4 was designed long time ago (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[RFC 760 / Internet Protocol]{http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc760.html}

\end_inset

 from January 1980) and since its inception, there have been many requests
 for more addresses and enhanced capabilities.
 Latest RFC is 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[RFC 2460 / Internet Protocol Version 6 Specification]{http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2460.html}

\end_inset

.
 Major changes in IPv6 are the redesign of the header, including the increase
 of address size from 32 bits to 128 bits.
 Because layer 3 is responsible for end-to-end packet transport using packet
 routing based on addresses, it must include the new IPv6 addresses (source
 and destination), like IPv4.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of lack of manpower, the IPv6 implementation in the kernel was unable
 to follow the discussed drafts or newly released RFCs.
 In October 2000, a project was started in Japan, called 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[USAGI]{http://www.linux-ipv6.org/}

\end_inset

, whose aim was to implement all missing, or outdated IPv6 support in Linux.
 It tracks the current IPv6 implementation in FreeBSD made by the

.
 From time to time they create snapshots against current vanilla Linux kernel
 sources.

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, the

\end_inset

 patch is so big, that current Linux networking maintainers are unable to
 include it in the production source of the Linux kernel 2.4.x series.
 Therefore the 2.4.x series is missing some (many) extensions and also does
 not confirm to all current drafts and RFCs (see 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[IP Version 6 Working Group (ipv6) Charter]{http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ipv6-charter.html}

\end_inset

 This can cause some interoperability problems with other operating systems.

 Hopefully the 2.6.x kernel series will contain a true and up-to-date IPv6

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What do IPv6 addresses look like?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
As previously mentioned, IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long.
 This number of bits generates very high decimal numbers with up to 39 digits:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2^128-1: 340282366920938463463374607431768211455
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
Such numbers are not really addresses that can be memorized.
 Also the IPv6 address schema is bitwise orientated (just like IPv4, but
 that's not often recognized).
 Therefore a better notation of such big numbers is hexadecimal.
 In hexadecimal, 4 bits (also known as 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

nibble
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

) are represented by a digit or character from 0-9 and a-f (10-15).
 This format reduces the length of the IPv6 address to 32 characters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2^128-1: 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
This representation is still not very convenient (possible mix-up or loss
 of single hexadecimal digits), so the designers of IPv6 chose a hexadecimal
 format with a colon as separator after each block of 16 bits.
 In addition, the leading "
\family typewriter
0x
\family default
" (a signifier for hexadecimal values used in programming languages) is
 removed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2^128-1: ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
A usable address (see address types later) is e.g.: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
3ffe:ffff:0100:f101:0210:a4ff:fee3:9566
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
For simplifications, leading zeros of each 16 bit block can be omitted:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
3ffe:ffff:0100:f101:0210:a4ff:fee3:9566  -> 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
¬ 3ffe:ffff:100:f101:210:a4ff:fee3:9566
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
One sequence of 16 bit blocks containing only zeroes can be replaced with
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

.
 But not more than one at a time, otherwise it is no longer a unique representat

FAQ (Basics)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Why is the name IPv6 and not IPv5 as successor for IPv4?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
On any IP header, the first 4 bits are reserved for protocol version.
 So theoretically a protocol number between 0 and 15 is possible:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\align left
4: is already used for IPv4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\align left
5: is reserved for the Stream Protocol (STP, 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[RFC 1819 / Internet Stream Protocol Version 2]{http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1819.html}

\end_inset

) (which never really made it to the public)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
The next free number was 6.
 Hence IPv6 was born!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
IPv6 addresses: why such a high number of bits?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
During the design of IPv4, people thought that 32 bits were enough for the
 world.
 Looking back into the past, 32 bits were enough until now and will perhaps
 be enough for another few years.
 However, 32 bits are not enough to provide each network device with a global
 address in the future.
 Think about mobile phones, cars (including electronic devices on its CAN-bus),
 toasters, refrigerators, light switches, and so on...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
So designers have chosen 128 bits, 4 times more in length and 2^96 greater
 in size than in IPv4 today.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The usable size is smaller than it may appear however.
 This is because in the currently defined address schema, 64 bits are used
 for interface identifiers.
 The other 64 bits are used for routing.
 Assuming the current strict levels of aggregation (/48, /32, ...), it is still
 possible to 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

run out
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

 of space, but hopefully not in the near future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
IPv6 addresses: why so small a number of bits on a new design?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
While, there are (possibly) some people (only know about Jim Fleming...) on
 the Internet who are thinking about IPv8 and IPv16, their design is far
 away from acceptance and implementation.
 In the meantime 128 bits was the best choice regarding header overhead
 and data transport.
 Consider the minimum Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) in IPv4 (576 octets) and
 in IPv6 (1280 octets), the header length in IPv4 is 20 octets (minimum,
 can increase to 60 octets with IPv4 options) and in IPv6 is 48 octets (fixed).
 This is 3.4 % of MTU in IPv4 and 3.8 % of MTU in IPv6.
 This means the header overhead is almost equal.
 More bits for addresses would require bigger headers and therefore more
 overhead.
 Also, consider the maximum MTU on normal links (like Ethernet today): it's
 1500 octets (in special cases: 9k octets using Jumbo frames).
 Ultimately, it wouldn't be a proper design if 10 % or 20 % of transported
 data in a Layer-3 packet were used for addresses and not for payload.

Address types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like IPv4, IPv6 addresses can be split into network and host parts using
 subnet masks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IPv4 has shown that sometimes it would be nice, if more than one IP address
 can be assigned to an interface, each for a different purpose (aliases,
 multi-cast).
 To remain extensible in the future, IPv6 is going further and allows more
 than one IPv6 address to be assigned to an interface.
 There is currently no limit defined by an RFC, only in the implementation
 of the IPv6 stack (to prevent DoS attacks).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using this large number of bits for addresses, IPv6 defines address types
 based on some leading bits, which are hopefully never going to be broken
 in the future (unlike IPv4 today and the history of class A, B, and C).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
Also the number of bits are separated into a network part (upper 64 bits)
 and a host part (lower 64 bits), to facilitate auto-configuration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Addresses without a special prefix

0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001 
\end_layout

or compressed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multicast scope is a parameter to specify the maximum distance a multicast
 packet can travel from the sending entity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, the following regions (scopes) are defined:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ffx1: node-local, packets never leave the node.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ffx2: link-local, packets are never forwarded by routers, so they never

\begin_layout Itemize
ffx5: site-local, packets never leave the site.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ffx8: organization-local, packets never leave the organization (not so easy

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ffxe: global scope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
others are reserved
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Multicast types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many types already defined/reserved (see 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[RFC 2373 / IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture]{http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2373.html}

\end_inset

 for details).
 Some examples are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All Nodes Address: ID = 1h, addresses all hosts on the local node (ff01:0:0:0:0:
0:0:1) or the connected link (ff02:0:0:0:0:0:0:1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All Routers Address: ID = 2h, addresses all routers on the local node (ff01:0:0:
0:0:0:0:2), on the connected link (ff02:0:0:0:0:0:0:2), or on the local
 site (ff05:0:0:0:0:0:0:2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Solicited node link-local multicast address
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Special multicast address used as destination address in neighborhood discovery,
 because unlike in IPv4, ARP no longer exists in IPv6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example of this address looks like
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
ff02::1:ff00:1234
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Used prefix shows that this is a link-local multicast address.
 The suffix is generated from the destination address.
 In this example, a packet should be sent to address 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fe80::1234
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but the network stack doesn't know the current layer 2 MAC address.
 It replaces the upper 104 bits with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ff02:0:0:0:0:1:ff00::/104
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and leaves the lower 24 bits untouched.
 This address is now used `on-link' to find the corresponding node which
 has to send a reply containing its layer 2 MAC address.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Anycast addresses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anycast addresses are special addresses and are used to cover things like
 nearest DNS server, nearest DHCP server, or similar dynamic groups.
 Addresses are taken out of the unicast address space (aggregatable global
 or site-local at the moment).
 The anycast mechanism (client view) will be handled by dynamic routing
 protocols.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: Anycast addresses cannot be used as source addresses, they are only
 used as destination addresses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Subnet-router anycast address
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A simple example for an anycast address is the subnet-router anycast address.
 Assuming that a node has the following global assigned IPv6 address:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
3ffe:ffff:100:f101:210:a4ff:fee3:9566/64  <- Node's address
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The subnet-router anycast address will be created blanking the suffix (least
 significant 64 bits) completely:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
3ffe:ffff:100:f101::/64  <- subnet-router anycast address
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Address types (host part)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
For auto-configuration and mobility issues, it was decided to use the lower
 64 bits as host part of the address in most of the current address types.
 Therefore each single subnet can hold a large amount of addresses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
This host part can be inspected differently: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Automatically computed (also known as stateless)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With auto-configuration, the host part of the address is computed by converting
 the MAC address of an interface (if available), with the EUI-64 method,
 to a unique IPv6 address.
 If no MAC address is available for this device (happens e.g.
 on virtual devices), something else (like the IPv4 address or the MAC address
 of a physical interface) is used instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
Consider again the first example 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
3ffe:ffff:100:f101:210:a4ff:fee3:9566
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
here, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
210:a4ff:fee3:9566 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

is the host part and computed from the NIC's MAC address 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
00:10:A4:E3:95:66 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
using the 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[IEEE-Tutorial EUI-64]{http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/tutorials/EUI64.html}

\end_inset

 design for EUI-48 identifiers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Privacy problem with automatically computed addresses and a solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
Because the "automatically computed" host part is globally unique (except
 when a vendor of a NIC uses the same MAC address on more than one NIC),
 client tracking is possible on the host when not using a proxy of any kind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
This is a known problem, and a solution was defined: privacy extension,
 defined in 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[RFC 3041 / Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6]{http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3041.html}

\end_inset

 (there is also already a newer draft available: 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[draft-ietf-ipngwg-temp-addresses-*.txt]{ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/}

\end_inset

).
 Using a random and a static value a new suffix is generated from time to
 time.
 Note: this is only reasonable for outgoing client connections and isn't
 really useful for well-known servers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Manually set
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For servers it's probably easier to remember simpler addresses, this can
 also be accommodated.
 It is possible to assign an additional IPv6 address to an interface, e.g.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
3ffe:ffff:100:f101::1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For manual suffixes like 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

::1
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

 shown in the above example it's required that the 7th most significant
 bit is set to 0 (the universal/local bit of the automatically generated
 identifier).
 Also some other (otherwise unchosen ) bit combinations are reserved for
 anycast addresses, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Prefix lengths for routing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the early design phase it was planned to use a fully hierarchical routing
 approach to reduce the size of the routing tables maximally.
 The reasoning behind this approach were the number of current IPv4 routing
 entries in core routers (> 104 thousand in May 2001), reducing the need
 of memory in hardware routers (ASIC 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

Application Specified Integrated Circuit
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

 driven) to hold the routing table and increase speed (fewer entries hopefully
 result in faster lookups).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
Todays view is that routing will be mostly hierarchically designed for networks
 with only one service provider.
 With more than one ISP connections, this is not possible, and subject to
 an issue named multi-homing (infos on multi-homing: 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[drafts*multi6*]{http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/}

\end_inset

,
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[IPv6 Multihoming Solutions]{http://arneill-py.sacramento.ca.us/ipv6mh/}

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Prefix lengths (also known as "netmasks")
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
Similar to IPv4, the routable network path for routing to take place.
 Because standard netmask notation for 128 bits doesn't look nice, designers
 employed the IPv4 Classless Inter Domain Routing (CIDR, 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[RFC 1519 / Classless Inter-Domain Routing]{http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1519.html}

\end_inset

) scheme, which specifies the number of bits of the IP address to be used
 for routing.
 It is also called the "slash" notation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
An example: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
3ffe:ffff:100:1:2:3:4:5/48
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
This notation will be expanded:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Network:

\begin_layout Code
3ffe:ffff:0100:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Netmask: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
ffff:ffff:ffff:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Matching a route
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under normal circumstances (no QoS) a lookup in a routing table results
 in the route with the most significant number of address bits means the
 route with the biggest prefix length matches first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example if a routing table shows following entries (list is not complete):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
3ffe:ffff:100::/48     ::            U  1 0 0 sit1 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2000::/3               ::192.88.99.1 UG 1 0 0 tun6to4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shown destination addresses of IPv6 packets will be routed through shown
 device
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
3ffe:ffff:100:1:2:3:4:5/48  ->  routed through device sit1

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family default
-file-system.
 Following entry must exists: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
/proc/net/if_inet6

\align left
A short automatical test looks like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# test -f /proc/net/if_inet6 && echo "Running kernel is IPv6 ready"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
If this fails, it is quite likely, that the IPv6 module is not loaded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Try to load IPv6 module
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
You can try to load the IPv6 module executing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# modprobe ipv6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
If this is successful, this module should be listed, testable with following
 auto-magically line:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# lsmod |grep -w 'ipv6' && echo "IPv6 module successfully loaded"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
And the check shown above should now run successfully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: unloading the module is currently not supported and can result, under
 some circumstances, in a kernel crash.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Automatically loading of module
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Its possible to automatically load the IPv6 module on demand.
 You only have to add following line in the configuration file of the kernel
 module loader (normally /etc/modules.conf or /etc/conf.modules):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
alias net-pf-10 ipv6  # automatically load IPv6 module on demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's also possible to disable automatically loading of the IPv6 module using
 following line
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
alias net-pf-10 off   # disable automatically load of IPv6 module on demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additional note: in kernels series 2.6.x, the module loader mechanism was
 changed.
 The new configuration file has to be named /etc/modprobe.conf instead of
 /etc/modules.conf.

\begin_layout Standard
A major issue is that because of the network layer structure of kernel implement
ation an IPv6 packet isn't really recognized by it's IP header number (6
 instead of 4).
 It's recognized by the protocol number of the Layer 2 transport protocol.
 Therefore any transport protocol which doesn't use such protocol number
 cannot dispatch IPv6 packets.
 Note: the packet is still transported over the link, but on receivers side,
 the dispatching won't work (you can see this e.g.
 using tcpdump).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ping6 <hostwithipv6address>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ping6 <ipv6address>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ping6 [-I <device>] <link-local-ipv6address>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ping6 -c 1 ::1 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
PING ::1(::1) from ::1 : 56 data bytes 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
64 bytes from ::1: icmp_seq=0 hops=64 time=292 usec
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
round-trip min/avg/max/mdev = 0.292/0.292/0.292/0.000 ms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hint: ping6 needs raw access to socket and therefore root permissions.
 So if non-root users cannot use ping6 then there are two possible problems:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
ping6 is not in users path (probably, because ping6 is generally stored
 in /usr/sbin -> add path (not really recommended)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
ping6 doesn't execute properly, generally because of missing root permissions
 -> chmod u+s /usr/sbin/ping6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Specifying interface for IPv6 ping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using link-local addresses for an IPv6 ping, the kernel does not know through
 which (physically or virtual) device it must send the packet - each device
 has a link-local address.
 A try will result in following error message:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ping6 fe80::212:34ff:fe12:3456 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
connect: Invalid argument
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case you have to specify the interface additionally like shown here:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ping6 -I eth0 -c 1 fe80::2e0:18ff:fe90:9205 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
PING fe80::212:23ff:fe12:3456(fe80::212:23ff:fe12:3456) from
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
64 bytes from fe80::212:23ff:fe12:3456: icmp_seq=0 hops=64 time=445 usec
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
¬ min/avg/max/mdev = 0.445/0.445/0.445/0.000 ms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Ping6 to multicast addresses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An interesting mechanism to detect IPv6-active hosts on a link is to ping6
 to the link-local all-node multicast address:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ping6 -I eth0 ff02::1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
PING ff02::1(ff02::1) from fe80:::2ab:cdff:feef:0123 eth0: 56 data bytes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
64 bytes from ::1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.104 ms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
64 bytes from fe80::212:34ff:fe12:3450: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.549 ms (DUP!)
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike in IPv4, where replies to a ping on the broadcast address can be
 disabled, in IPv6 currently this behavior cannot be disable except by local
 IPv6 firewalling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: unlike some modern versions of IPv4 traceroute, which can use ICMPv4
 echo-request packets as well as UDP packets (default), current IPv6-traceroute
 is only able to send UDP packets.
 As you perhaps already know, ICMP echo-request packets are more accepted
 by firewalls or ACLs on routers inbetween than UDP packets.

IPv6 tcpdump
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On Linux, tcpdump is the major tool for packet capturing.
 Below you find some examples.
 IPv6 support is normally built-in in current releases of version 3.6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
tcpdump uses expressions for filtering packets to minimize the noise:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
icmp6: filters native ICMPv6 traffic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ip6: filters native IPv6 traffic (including ICMPv6)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
proto ipv6: filters tunneled IPv6-in-IPv4 traffic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
not port ssh: to suppress displaying SSH packets for running tcpdump in
 a remote SSH session
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also some command line options are very useful to catch and print more informati
on in a packet, mostly interesting for digging into ICMPv6 packets:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-s 512
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Checking DNS for resolving IPv6 addresses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of security updates in the last years every Domain Name System (DNS)
 server should run newer software which already understands the (intermediate)
 IPv6 address-type AAAA (the newer one named A6 isn't still common at the
 moment because only supported using BIND9 and newer and also the non-existent
 support of root domain IP6.ARPA).
 A simple test whether the used system can resolve IPv6 addresses is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# host -t AAAA www.join.uni-muenster.de
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and should show something like following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
www.join.uni-muenster.de.
 is an alias for tolot.join.uni-muenster.de.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Automatic proxy settings (*.pac) cannot be extended to handle IPv6 requests
 differently (e.g.
 don't use proxy) because of their nature (written in Java-script and well

6to4 tunneling (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[RFC 3056 / Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds]{http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3056.html}

\end_inset

) uses a simple mechanism to create automatic tunnels.
 Each node with a global unique IPv4 address is able to be a 6to4 tunnel
 endpoint (if no IPv4 firewall prohibits traffic).
 6to4 tunneling is mostly not a one-to-one tunnel.
 This case of tunneling can be divided into upstream and downstream tunneling.
 Also, a special IPv6 address indicates that this node will use 6to4 tunneling
 for connecting the world-wide IPv6 network

Setup of 6to4 tunnels
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pay attention that the support of 6to4 tunnels currently lacks on vanilla
 kernel series 2.2.x (see 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref[systemcheck/kernel]{systemcheck-kernel}

\end_inset

 for more information).
 Also note that that the prefix length for a 6to4 address is 16 because
 of from network point of view, all other 6to4 enabled hosts are on the
 same layer 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Add a 6to4 tunnel
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, you have to calculate your 6to4 prefix using your local assigned
 global routable IPv4 address (if your host has no global routable IPv4
 address, in special cases NAT on border gateways is possible):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming your IPv4 address is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
1.2.3.4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
the generated 6to4 prefix will be
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2002:0102:0304::
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Local 6to4 gateways should (but it's not a must, you can choose an arbitrary
 suffix with local-scope, if you feel better) always assigned the suffix
 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

::1
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

, therefore your local 6to4 address will be
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
2002:0102:0304::1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use e.g.
 following for automatic generation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
ipv4="1.2.3.4"; printf "2002:%02x%02x:%02x%02x::1" `echo $ipv4 | tr "." " "`
\end_layout

There are two ways possible to setup 6to4 tunneling now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

conf/all/forwarding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Type: BOOLEAN
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This enables global IPv6 forwarding between all interfaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In IPv6 you can't control forwarding per device, forwarding control has
 to be done using IPv6-netfilter (controlled with ip6tables) rulesets and
 specify input and output devices (see 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref[Firewalling/Netfilter6]{firewalling-netfilter6}

\end_inset

 for more).
 This is different to IPv4, where you are able to control forwarding per
 device (decision is made on interface where packet came in).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This also sets all interfaces' Host/Router setting 'forwarding' to the specified
 value.
 See below for details.
 This referred to as global forwarding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If this value is 0, no IPv6 forwarding is enabled, packets never leave another
 interface, neither physical nor logical like e.g.
 tunnels.

Support for persistent IPv6 configuration in Linux distributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some Linux distribution contain already support of a persistent IPv6 configurati
on using existing or new configuration and script files and some hook in
 the IPv4 script files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Red Hat Linux and

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since starting writing the 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[IPv6 & Linux - HowTo]{http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/}

\end_inset

 it was my intention to enable a persistent IPv6 configuration which catch
 most of the wished cases like host-only, router-only, dual-homed-host,
 router with second stub network, normal tunnels, 6to4 tunnels, and so on.
 Nowadays there exists a set of configuration and script files which do
 the job very well (never heard about real problems, but I don't know how
 many use the set).
 Because this configuration and script files are extended from time to time,
 they got their own homepage: 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[initscripts-ipv6 homepage]{http://www.deepspace6.net/projects/initscripts-ipv6.html}

\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[Mirror]{http://mirrors.bieringer.de/www.deepspace6.net/projects/initscripts-ipv6.html}

\end_inset

).
 Because I began my IPv6 experience using a Red Hat Linux 5.0 clone, my IPv6
 development systems are mostly Red Hat Linux based now, it's kind a logic
 that the scripts are developed for this kind of distribution (so called
 
\emph on
historic issue
\emph default
).
 Also it was very easy to extend some configuration files, create new ones
 and create some simple hook for calling IPv6 setup during IPv4 setup.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fortunately, in Red Hat Linux since 7.1 a snapshot of my IPv6 scripts is
 included, this was and is still further on assisted by Pekka Savola.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mandrake since version 8.0 also includes an IPv6-enabled initscript package,
 but a minor bug still prevents usage (

\begin_layout Subsection
Test for IPv6 support of network configuration scripts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can test, whether your Linux distribution contain support for persistent
 IPv6 configuration using my set.
 Following script library should exist:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/network-functions-ipv6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Auto-magically test:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# test -f /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/network-functions-ipv6 && echo
 "Main
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
¬ IPv6 script library exists"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The version of the library is important if you miss some features.
 You can get it executing following (or easier look at the top of the file):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# source /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/network-functions-ipv6 &&
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code

Firewalling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IPv6 firewalling is important, especially if using IPv6 on internal networks
 with global IPv6 addresses.
 Because unlike at IPv4 networks where in common internal hosts are protected
 automatically using private IPv4 addresses like 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[RFC 1918 / Address Allocation for Private Internets]{http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1918.html}

\end_inset

 or Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[Google search for Microsoft + APIPA]{http://www.google.com/search?q=apipa+microsoft}

\end_inset

, in IPv6 normally global addresses are used and someone with IPv6 connectivity
 can reach all internal IPv6 enabled nodes.

Firewalling using netfilter6 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Native IPv6 firewalling is only supported in kernel versions 2.4+.

 be specified
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Accept incoming ICMPv6 through tunnels

\begin_layout Code
# ip6tables -A INPUT -i sit+ -p icmpv6 -j ACCEPT

\begin_layout Itemize
Allow outgoing ICMPv6 through tunnels 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ip6tables -A OUTPUT -o sit+ -p icmpv6 -j ACCEPT 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Newer kernels allow specifying of ICMPv6 types:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ip6tables -A INPUT -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type echo-request -j ACCEPT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Rate-limiting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because it can happen (author already saw it to times) that an ICMPv6 storm
 will raise up, you should use available rate limiting for at least ICMPv6
 ruleset.
 In addition logging rules should also get rate limiting to prevent DoS
 attacks against syslog and storage of log file partition.
 An example for a rate limited ICMPv6 looks like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ip6tables -A INPUT --protocol icmpv6 --icmpv6-type echo-request
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
¬ -j ACCEPT --match limit --limit 30/minute

\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
¬ --dport 22 -j ACCEPT 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Allow response packets (at the moment IPv6 connection tracking isn't in

\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
¬ --sport 22 ! --syn j ACCEPT 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Enable tunneled IPv6-in-IPv4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To accept tunneled IPv6-in-IPv4 packets, you have to insert rules in your
 
\series bold
IPv4 firewall setup
\series default
 relating to such packets, for example 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Accept incoming IPv6-in-IPv4 on interface ppp0 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# iptables -A INPUT -i ppp0 -p ipv6 -j ACCEPT 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Allow outgoing IPv6-in-IPv4 to interface ppp0 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# iptables -A OUTPUT -o ppp0 -p ipv6 -j ACCEPT 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have only a static tunnel, you can specify the IPv4 addresses, too,
 like 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Accept incoming IPv6-in-IPv4 on interface ppp0 from tunnel endpoint 1.2.3.4
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# iptables -A INPUT -i ppp0 -p ipv6 -s 1.2.3.4 -j ACCEPT 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Allow outgoing IPv6-in-IPv4 to interface ppp0 to tunnel endpoint 1.2.3.4 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# iptables -A OUTPUT -o ppp0 -p ipv6 -d 1.2.3.4 -j ACCEPT 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Protection against incoming TCP connection requests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
VERY RECOMMENDED!
\series default
 For security issues you should really insert a rule which blocks incoming
 TCP connection requests.
 Adapt "-i" option, if other interface names are in use! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Block incoming TCP connection requests to this host 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ip6tables -I INPUT -i sit+ -p tcp --syn -j DROP 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Block incoming TCP connection requests to hosts behind this router 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ip6tables -I FORWARD -i sit+ -p tcp --syn -j DROP 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps the rules have to be placed below others, but that is work you have
 to think about it.
 Best way is to create a script and execute rules in a specified way.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Protection against incoming UDP connection requests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
ALSO RECOMMENDED!
\series default
 Like mentioned on my firewall information it's possible to control the
 ports on outgoing UDP/TCP sessions.
 So if all of your local IPv6 systems are using local ports e.g.
 from 32768 to 60999 you are able to filter UDP connections also (until
 connection tracking works) like: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Block incoming UDP packets which cannot be responses of outgoing requests
 of this host 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ip6tables -I INPUT -i sit+ -p udp ! --dport 32768:60999 -j DROP 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Block incoming UDP packets which cannot be responses of forwarded requests
 of hosts behind this router 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ip6tables -I FORWARD -i sit+ -p udp ! --dport 32768:60999 -j DROP 
\end_layout

IPv6 security auditing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently there are no comfortable tools out which are able to check a system
 over network for IPv6 security issues.
 Neither 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[Nessus]{http://www.nessus.org/}

\end_inset

 nor any commercial security scanner is as far as I know able to scan IPv6
 addresses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Legal issues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ATTENTION: always take care that you only scan your own systems or after
 receiving a written order, otherwise legal issues are able to come up to
 you.
\newline
CHECK destination IPv6 addresses TWICE before starting a scan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\end_inset

 for more) you can run a portscan by wrapping a script around which run
 through a port range, grab banners and so on.
 Usage example:

Security auditing using IPv6-enabled strobe
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Strobe is a (compared to NMap) more a low budget portscanner, but there
 is an IPv6-enabling patch available (see 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[IPv6+Linux-status-apps/security-auditing]{http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/status/IPv6+Linux-status-apps.html#security-auditing}

\end_inset

 for more).
 Usage example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ./strobe ::1 strobe 1.05 (c) 1995-1999 Julian Assange <proff@iq.org>.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code

\begin_layout Standard
Note: strobe isn't really developed further on, the shown version number

\begin_layout Chapter
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{chapter-encryption-authentication}

\end_inset

Encryption and Authentication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike in IPv4, encryption and authentication is a mandatory feature of
 IPv6.
 Those features are normally implemented using IPsec (which can be also
 used by IPv4).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Modes of using encryption and authentication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two modes of encryption and authentication of a connection are possible:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Transport mode
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Transport mode is a real end-to-end connection mode.
 Here, only the payload (usually ICMP, TCP or UDP) is encrypted with their
 particular header, while the IP header is not encrypted (but usually included
 in authentication).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using AES-128 for encryption and SHA1 for authentication, this mode decreases
 the MTU by 42 octets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Tunnel mode
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tunnel mode can be used either for end-to-end or for gateway-to-gateway
 connection modes.
 Here, the complete IP packet is being encrypted and gets a new IP header
 prepended, all together constituing a new IP packet (this mechanism is
 also known as "encapsulation")
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This mode usually decreases the MTU by 40 octets from the MTU of transport
 mode.
 I.e.
 using AES-128 for encryption and SHA1 for authentication 82 octets less
 than the normal MTU.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Support in kernel (ESP and AH)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Support in vanilla Linux kernel 2.4.x
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the time of writing missing in vanilla up to 2.4.28.
 There was an issue about keeping the Linux kernel source free of export/import-
control-laws regarding encryption code.
 This is also one case why 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[FreeS/WAN project]{http://www.freeswan.org/}

\end_inset

 wasn't included in vanilla source.
 Perhaps a backport from 2.6.x will be done in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Support in vanilla Linux kernel 2.6.x
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Current versions (as time of writing 2.6.9 and upper) support native IPsec
 for IPv4 and IPv6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Implementation was helped by the USAGI project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Automatic key exchange (IKE)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IPsec requires a key exchange of a secret.
 This is mostly done automatically by so called IKE daemons.
 They also handle the authentication of the peers, either by a common known
 secret (so called 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

pre-shared secret
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

) or by RSA keys (which can also be used from X.509 certificates).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, two different IKE daemons are available for Linux, which totally
 differ in configuration and usage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I prefer 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

pluto
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

 from the *S/WAN implementation because of the easier and one-config-only
 setup.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
IKE daemon 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

racoon
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The IKE daemon 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

racoon
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

 is taken from the KAME project and ported to Linux.
 Modern Linux distributions contain this daemon in the package 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

ipsec-tools
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

.
 Two executables are required for a proper IPsec setup.
 Take a look on 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[Linux Advanced Routing & Traffic Control HOWTO / IPSEC]{http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.ipsec.html}

\begin_layout Standard
IPv6 is supported since version 9.
 Always use newest available version.
 At least version 9.1.3 must be used, older versions can contain remote exploitabl
e security holes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Listening on IPv6 addresses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: unlike in IPv4 current versions doesn't allow to bind a server socket
 to dedicated IPv6 addresses, so only 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
none
\emph default

 Because this can be a security issue, check the Access Control List (ACL)
 section below, too!

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Enable BIND named for listening on IPv6 address
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To enable IPv6 for listening, following options are requested to change
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
options {

\begin_layout Code
        # sure other options here, too
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        listen-on-v6 { any; };
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
};
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This should result after restart in e.g.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# netstat -lnptu |grep "named

\end_layout

\begin_layout Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
IPv6 enabled Access Control Lists (ACL)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IPv6 enabled ACLs are possible and should be used whenever it's possible.
 An example looks like following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
acl internal-net { 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        127.0.0.1; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        1.2.3.0/24;  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        3ffe:ffff:100::/56; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        ::1/128; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        ::ffff:1.2.3.4/128; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
};
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
acl ns-internal-net { 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        1.2.3.4;  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        1.2.3.5;  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        3ffe:ffff:100::4/128; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        3ffe:ffff:100::5/128; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
};
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This ACLs can be used e.g.
 for queries of clients and transfer zones to secondary name-servers.
 This prevents also your caching name-server to be used from outside using
 IPv6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
options {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        # sure other options here, too
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        listen-on-v6 { none; };
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        allow-query { internal-net; }; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        allow-transfer { ns-internal-net; }; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
};
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's also possible to set the 
\emph on
allow-query 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
allow-transfer
\emph default
 option for most of single zone definitions, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sending queries with dedicated IPv6 address
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This option is not required, but perhaps needed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
query-source-v6 address <ipv6address|*> port <port|*>;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Per zone defined dedicated IPv6 addresses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's also possible to define per zone some IPv6 addresses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Transfer source address 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Transfer source address is used for outgoing zone transfers:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
transfer-source-v6 <ipv6addr|*> [port port];
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Notify source address 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notify source address is used for outgoing notify messages:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code

Router Advertisement Daemon (radvd)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The router advertisement daemon is very useful on a LAN, if clients should
 be auto-configured.
 The daemon itself should run on the Linux default IPv6 gateway router (it's
 not required that this is also the default IPv4 gateway, so pay attention
 who on your LAN is sending router advertisements).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can specify some information and flags which should be contained in
 the advertisement.
 Common used are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Prefix (needed)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lifetime of the prefix
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Frequency of sending advertisements (optional)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a proper configuration, the daemon sends advertisements through specified
 interfaces and clients are hopefully receive them and auto-magically configure
 addresses with received prefix and the default route.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Configuring radvd
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Simple configuration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Radvd's config file is normally /etc/radvd.conf.
 An simple example looks like following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
interface eth0 { 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        AdvSendAdvert on;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        MinRtrAdvInterval 3; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        MaxRtrAdvInterval 10;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        prefix 3ffe:ffff:0100:f101::/64 { 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                AdvOnLink on; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                AdvAutonomous on; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                AdvRouterAddr on; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        };
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
};
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This results on client side in
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# ip -6 addr show eth0 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
3: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 100 
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
    inet6 fe80::2e0:12ff:fe34:1234/10 scope link
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because no lifetime was defined, a very high value was used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Special 6to4 configuration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Version since 0.6.2pl3 support the automatic (re)-generation of the prefix
 depending on an IPv4 address of a specified interface.
 This can be used to distribute advertisements in a LAN after the 6to4 tunneling
 has changed.
 Mostly used behind a dynamic dial-on-demand Linux router.
 Because of the sure shorter lifetime of such prefix (after each dial-up,
 another prefix is valid), the lifetime configured to minimal values:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
interface eth0 { 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        AdvSendAdvert on;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        MinRtrAdvInterval 3; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        MaxRtrAdvInterval 10;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        prefix 0:0:0:f101::/64 { 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                AdvOnLink off; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                AdvAutonomous on; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                AdvRouterAddr on; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                Base6to4Interface ppp0;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                AdvPreferredLifetime 20; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
                AdvValidLifetime 30;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
        };
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
};
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This results on client side in (assuming, ppp0 has currently 1.2.3.4 as local
 IPv4 address):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# /sbin/ip -6 addr show eth0 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
3: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 100 
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
   inet6 fe80::2e0:12ff:fe34:1234/10 scope link
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because a small lifetime was defined, such prefix will be thrown away quickly,
 if no related advertisement was received.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additional note: if you do not used special 6to4 support in initscripts,
 you have to setup a special route on the internal interface on the router,
 otherwise you will get some backrouting problems.
 for the example showh here:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
# /sbin/ip -6 route add 2002:0102:0304
\series bold
:
\series default
f101::/64 dev eth0 metric 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This route needs to be replaced every time the prefix changes, which is
 the case after a new IPv4 address was assigned to the dial-up interface.

 You should see your configured values here again, if not, perhaps it's
 not your radvd which sends the advertisement...look for another router on
 the link (and take the LLAddress, which is the MAC address for tracing).

tcp_wrapper
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
tcp_wrapper is a library which can help you to protect service against misuse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Filtering capabilities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can use tcp_wrapper for
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Filtering against source addresses (IPv4 or IPv6)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Filtering against users (requires a running ident daemon on the client)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Which program uses tcp_wrapper
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following are known:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each service which is called by xinetd (if xinetd is compiled using tcp_wrapper
 library)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
sshd (if compiled using tcp_wrapper)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
tcp_wrapper is controlled by two files name /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny.
 For more information see
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
$ man hosts.allow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Example for /etc/hosts.allow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this file, each service which should be positive filtered (means connects
 are accepted) need a line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
sshd:           1.2.3.
 [3ffe:ffff:100:200::]/64
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
daytime-stream: 1.2.3.
 [3ffe:ffff:100:200::]/64
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: there are broken implementations around, which uses following broken
 IPv6 network description: [3ffe:ffff:100:200::/64].
 Hopefully, such versions will be fixed soon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Example for /etc/hosts.deny
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This file contains all negative filter entries and should normally deny
 the rest using
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
ALL: ALL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If this node is a more sensible one you can replace the standard line above
 with this one, but this can cause a DoS attack (load of mailer and spool
 directory), if too many connects were made in short time.
 Perhaps a logwatch is better for such issues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
ALL: ALL: spawn (echo "Attempt from %h %a to %d at `date`" 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Code
 | tee -a /var/log/tcp.deny.log | mail root@localhost)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Logging
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Depending on the entry in the syslog daemon configuration file /etc/syslog.conf
 the tcp_wrapper logs normally into /var/log/secure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Refused connection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A refused connection via IPv4 to an xinetd covered daytime service produces
 a line like following example
