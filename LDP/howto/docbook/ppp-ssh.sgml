  <para>
A PPP-SSH VPN is probably the easiest type of VPN to set up.
It uses nothing more than the very common PPP and SSH utilities
to form an encrypted network tunnel between two hosts.

<sect1 id="intro">
<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
The technique described in this HOWTO uses PPP to convert packets
into a character stream and SSH to encrypt it
and transmit it to the remote computer.  Most system administrators
are well acquainted with the tools and configuration files needed
to set up a PPP-SSH VPN.
</para>

<para>
While it works well with moderate loads over a reliable
connection, be warned that a PPP-SSH VPN is subject to
some scalability problems.  I've included a list of benefits in
<xref linkend="benefits"> and drawbacks in
<xref linkend="drawbacks"> so you can decide
for yourself if a PPP-SSH VPN is a good fit for your needs.

<title>Credits</title>

<para>
I took some notes as I adapted Bart Trojanowski's excellent
<ulink url="http://www.jukie.net/~bart/security/vpn/">
instructions</ulink> to a newer version of PPP running on
my Debian system.
A few weeks later, I converted the notes into SGML.
Eventually, those evolved into this HOWTO.
</para>

<para>
Bart's instructions were based on Arpad Magosanyi's 
good but now fairly dated
<ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/VPN.html">
VPN Mini-HOWTO</ulink>.
If you run into troubles and my document doesn't seem to help,
or if you're running an older version of the Linux kernel or PPP,
you'll definitely want to give his HOWTO a read.
</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>


<sect1 id="Introduction">
<title>Introduction</title>

<sect2 id="benefits">
<title>PPP-SSH Benefits</title>

<para>
There are a number of benefits to setting up a PPP-SSH VPN.
It's relatively simple, it uses common off-the-shelf tools,
and it probably won't require a reboot before bringing up the link.
Here's a more comprehensive list:
</para>

<variablelist>

  <varlistentry>
    <term>Easy to install</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
You probably won't need to patch or recompile your kernel, run
LILO, reboot, or perform any other perilous administration activities.
PPP and SSH are included with most distributions, and
most kernels come preconfigured to use them properly.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
    <term>Easy to set up</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
You should not have to edit any existing configuration files.
You simply customize the script file provided later in this document,
which contains all the VPN configuration info, and then execute it
on the client machine. Any existing PPP or SSH configurations
should continue to work just fine.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
    <term>No mucking with firewalling</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
If the SSH protocol currently traverses your firewall,
then PPP over SSH will traverse your firewall as well.
(If you aren't using SSH, then why not?  It is almost
a required tool for system administrators nowadays.)
    </para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
    <term>No mucking with manual routing</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
pppd automatically sets up routing for you.
And, if you have very complex routing needs, it's very easy
to put the custom routing commands in the script file.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
    <term>No need for static IP addresses</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
PPP-SSH VPNs have no trouble whatsoever with dynamic IP addressess.
The client must be able to find the server to connect to, of course,
but dynamic DNS would work fine for that.
Setting up a VPN over a dialup connection is no problem.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
    <term>Multiple Tunnels are Easy</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
It's easy to set up multiple tunnels to a single computer.
You simply need to make sure that the IP address for 
each tunnel's network interface is distinct.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

</variablelist>

</sect2>


<sect2 id="drawbacks">
<title>PPP-SSH Drawbacks</title>

<para>
This type of VPN is not without a few difficulties.
Basically, it doesn't run unattended very well.  If you're
looking for a production-quality VPN that you can
set up and forget about, you will proabably find
PPP-SSH a little disappointing.  Some alternatives
are described in <xref linkend="alternatives">.
</para>

<variablelist>

  <varlistentry>
    <term>Trying to maintain a TCP connection</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
If the SSH TCP connection is broken for any reason,
your VPN goes down hard and takes all tunnelled TCP connections with it.
If you have a less than reliable link --
say it's difficult to download more than a few tens of megabytes
at one go -- you will be re-starting the VPN a lot.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
	
  <varlistentry>
    <term>Running IP packets over a TCP stream</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
The TCP protocol consists of streams layered on top
of IP packets.
When you <emphasis>then</emphasis> run IP packets
over the TCP stream (as we're attempting to do),
the personality conflict between the two can become very apparent.
Mostly, this manifests itself as weird delays, dropouts, and oscillations.
Sometimes you'll see problems at load, sometimes with next to no traffic.
Short of changing the entire OSI model (ha ha), there's not much that can
be done about this.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
    <term>Tends to be bursty</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
For some reason, when network load gets
high, one tunneled TCP connection tends to get all the bandwidth
and the others get ignored.
This leads to timeouts and dropped connections.
Theoretically, this is fixable.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
    <term>Can't reliably tell when link is down</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
Keepalives are small packets sent to tell the machine
on the other end that the connection is still up.
If the network load gets too high, keepalives
will be delayed.  The other machine will mistakenly
assume the connection has
been dropped and take down its end of the link.
    </para>
    <para>
Without keepalives, however, there's no way for either machine tell if the
link has been dropped.  When one machine tries to bring the link back up,
if the other machine thinks it already has it up, confusion can reign.
Most often this will show up as multiple ppp network devices,
duplicate routes, and tunnels that appear to be up but drop every packet.
A liberal use of "killall -9 pppd" will usually set things back in order.
A more intelligent start script could probably improve this.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
    <term>Too many simultaneous connections avalanches fast</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
When I use regular PPP over a 56K modem and Postfix opens 10+
connections to deliver my outgoing mail, everything works well.
However, when I try to run this exact traffic over a VPN tunneled
over a much faster DSL link, it stalls out.
Ping times skyrocket for a spell (2 minutes and beyond), traffic moves
at a trickle for a while, then it stops completely.
The only way to get packets moving again is to restart the tunnel.
I'm not sure if this is a bug or an inherent
limitation.  Reducing the number of connections that Postfix maintains
for outgoing mail fixed this problem for me..
    </para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
    <term>It's high-overhead, high-latency</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
Ping times over my 57.6 modem connection are normally in the
130-170 ms range.  However, ping times for a PPP-SSH VPN running 
over the same modem connection are in the 300-330 ms range.  Turning
on PPP compression can help a lot if you're transmitting compressible
data.  Email is compressible, Vorbis files are not.

There are a ton of VPN technologies in the world now.  If PPP-SSH
doesn't fit all your needs, you might want to check one of the
following packages.
</para>

<variablelist>

  <varlistentry>
    <term>ipsec</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
ipsec describes a set of low-level protocols, 
<ulink url="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2406.html">ESP</ulink> and
<ulink url="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2402.html">AH</ulink>,
to perform authentication and encryption
at the packet level.  It also uses a higher-level protocol,
<ulink url="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2408.html">IKE</ulink>,
to negotiate connection parameters and exchange encryption keys.
    </para>
    <para>
FreeS/WAN is probably the best Linux ipsec implementation today.
Although it can be very difficult to set up, especially for those
who are not terribly familiar with networking,
it is amazingly stable once it is working.
You can find out more at the 
<ulink url="http://www.freeswan.org/">FreeS/WAN home page</ulink>.
    </para>
    <para>
Another good, free ipsec implementation is 
<ulink url="http://www.antd.nist.gov/cerberus/">Cerberus</ulink>.
Unfortunately, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
only distributes Cerberus to US or Candadian citizens currently
located in either the US or Canada. Therefore, depending on who
you are, obtaining Cerberus ranges from moderately
difficult to effectively impossible.

It is a very common and well-understood technology and has many
mature implementations on all commonly-used computer platforms.
However PPTP is generally considered to have

<sect2>
<title>Requirements</title>

<itemizedlist> 

  <listitem>
    <para>
Your kernel must have support for TCP/IP and PPP compiled in.
Almost all distributions ship with PPP support straight
out of the box.  If yours didn't, or if you're using a custom kernel,
I'll include a little more detail about this in
<xref linkend="kernel">.
    </para>
  </ListItem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
You must install the pppd daemon.  This most likely comes with your
distribution. I'm using ppp-2.3.11.  Later versions should work just
fine, and earlier versions should also work as
well as long as they support the "pty" option.  You don't need to install
chat or any of the other tools designed to work with PPP -- you just need
pppd.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
The client machine needs to have the the ssh client installed.
There are many different versions of ssh floating around,
but they should all work.
I'm using OpenBSD's &openssh; package version 2.2.0p1.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
The server machine needs the sshd daemon to field ssh requests from
the client.  OpenSSH includes a very good ssh daemon.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
Finally, you want to install the sudo tool on the server.
You can find out more about sudo in the &lasg, in the Administration Tools
section, and the &linsechowto;, in the Root Security section.
You might also want to look at &sudoshomepage;.

  <listitem>
    <para>
What is the hostname or IP address for your VPN server?

On your server, what username will the VPN software run under?
This HOWTO includes instructions on how to create a

This should <emphasis>not</emphasis> be root!
For security and logging, this should be a dedicated account.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
    <term>Server Interface IP Address</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
The PPP-SSH VPN sets up dedicated network interfaces on both the client
and the server.  The interface will be pppN, where N is the number of
the first unused ppp interface (i.e. it will be ppp1 if you're already
using ppp0 to dial out over your modem).
    </para>
    <para>
You will need to specify the IP address for the interface on the server.
This address is only visible to the client and server (and to any machines
on subnets that the client and server may be forwarding 
unmasqueraded packets for).
    </para>
    <para>
If you don't know what IP address to pick, read chapter 2.2 in the
<ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/LDP/nag2/index.html">
Linux Network Administrators Guide</ulink>
and especially look at Table 2-1.
For example, 192.168.0.1 is a good choice.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
    <term>Client Interface IP Address</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
You need to select the IP address for the interface on the
client.  It must, of course, be on the same network as the
server's IP address.
It must not conflict with any other networks on the client, nor can
it be the same as the server's network interface IP address.
If you selected 192.168.0.1 for the previous answer, you
would probably use 192.168.0.2 here.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

</variablelist>

<para>
My setup looks like this:
</para>

<screen>
SERVER_HOSTNAME = eldivino.domain.com
SERVER_USERNAME = vpn
SERVER_IFIPADDR = 192.168.3.1
CLIENT_IFIPADDR = 192.168.3.2
</screen>

</sect2>


<sect2 id="kernel">
<title>Set Up PPP</title>

<para>
The kernel's PPP code can either be compiled into the kernel
itself or it can be put in loadable kernel modules.
If you compiled it into the kernel, you can
skip on to the next step -- you're done here.
However, if you're loading PPP as modules, you need to make
sure the modules get properly loaded.
</para>

<para>
You can check to see if ppp is listed, along with all other
currently loaded modules, when you run lsmod.  Remember to check
that the PPP module is loaded on both the client and the server.
</para>

<screen>
server$ /sbin/lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
ppp                    20780   0 (unused)

slhc                    4376   1  [ppp]
</screen>

<para>
If you're sure ppp was compiled as a module, but it's not loaded into
the kernel, try loading it with modprobe:
</para>

<screen>
# modprobe ppp
</screen>

<para>
If modprobe didn't return any errors, check lsmod again --
it should be listed this time.  If so, then your ppp module
is not being loaded at boot time.
This is OK if you're running the kernel daemon as the PPP modules
will be loaded on demand.
If you're not, however, you'll need to manually load the
modules at boot time by putting a single line consisting
entirely of the word "ppp" in your /etc/modules file.
</para>

<para>
See the &kernhowto; for more on this subject.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="sshfirewall">
<title>Allow SSH Through the Firewall</title>

<para>
The only network traffic between the two machines
(as a result of the tunnel, of course) will be over the
SSH protocol.
</para>

<para>
SSH uses only TCP streams -- no UDP or ICMP.
 The ssh server (sshd) listens on port 22.
Our client (because we use the -P flag) only uses the unpriveleged ports
from 1024 through 65535.  This description should have given you
enough information to set up your firewall.
</para>

<para>
For example, here are the ipchains commands needed to allow
ssh connections to the server.
We allow incoming SSH connection between port 22 on the local
machine and any port on the remote.
 Replace eth0 with the interface
that will be carrying the ssh traffic and $IPADDR with the IP
address of that interface.
</para>

<screen>
ipchains -A input  -i eth0 -p tcp -d $IPADDR 22 -j ACCEPT
ipchains -A output -i eth0 -p tcp ! -y -s $IPADDR 22 -j ACCEPT
</screen>

<title>Create a VPN User</title>

<para>
The incoming SSH VPN requests must be directed to a particular user
on the server.  For security and accountability, I recommend you
use a dedicated user to field VPN requests.  The following steps will
set up a system user named "vpn" to do just that.
</para>

<orderedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>
First, we create the user's account.  Accounts come in two ranges:
the system range (typically 100-999) and the regular user range (1000+).
"--system" tells adduser to add the user in the system range and
to give him /bin/false for the login shell.  "--group"
tells adduser to also create a group of the same name as the user,
and to add the user to the group.
    </para>
<screen>
server# adduser --sytem --group vpn
</screen>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
<para>
Since the vpn user needs to log in via ssh, change vpn's shell from
/bin/false to /bin/bash in the /etc/passwd file.  You can simply
edit /etc/passwd using vi or any other decent text editor.
</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
<para>
Create a password for the vpn user.  It can (and should) be very
complex, since you'll only type it a few times while setting up the
VPN.  After that, you'll never type it again.

<screen>
server# passwd vpn
Enter new UNIX password: 
Retype new UNIX password:

Now, copy th the client's /root/.ssh/identity.pub file

You may or may not need to use the -P option, depending on how your
client's firewall is set up.  If port 22 is blocked on your client

then -P tells ssh to use an unprivileged port even though it's
running as a priveleged user.

<title>Set Up sudo</title>

<para>
pppd needs to run as root.  However, on the server, we're running
everything as the "vpn" user.  How can the vpn user run pppd?
</para>

<para>
There are a number of ways of solving this problem.  One is to use
the suid bit, and arrange permissions by groups.  However, this can get
confusing and difficult to administer pretty fast, leading to unintentional
security holes.  Personally,
I find the sudo utility to be a much better solution.
</para>

<para>
sudo gives ordinary users superuser powers,
but only for a very limited set of commands.
The system administrator gets to decide what commands are allowed
and how much logging to perform. In this case, we want to
allow the user "vpn" to run pppd with superuser privilege, but
not be allowed to do anything else.
</para>

<orderedlist>

<listitem>
<para>
We need to edit sudo's configuration file, /etc/sudoers.
To use proper locking, hopefully preventing accidents and race conditions,
use the visudo command to edit /etc/sudoers.
If you're not faimiliar with vi, see the &vihowto;.
</para>

<screen>

Add these two lines to the bottom of the file:
</para>

<screen>

vpn ALL=NOPASSWD: VPN
</screen>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Now, verify that sudo is set up correctly.  As the "vpn" user on the
server, try running pppd using sudo:
</para>

<screen>
server# su - vpn
server$ sudo /usr/sbin/pppd noauth
~9}#ÀZ}!}!} }9}"}k} }r} }'}%}zt2-·}'}"}
</screen>

<para>
If you get a whole bunch of PPP garbage to the screen
(like the last line above), this is
good.  It means that the vpn user is allowed to run pppd.  You can
now switch to another terminal to kill it off, or you can just
let pppd finish on its own.  It should give up trying to connect
after 30 seconds or so.
</para>

<para>
However, if you get "bash: /usr/sbin/pppd: Permission denied"
or some other sort of error,
or it asks for a password, then sudo is probably not working.
You'll need to try figure out what is going wrong.  Verify
that pppd is in /usr/sbin, and that you set up the sudoers
file correctly.

<sect3>
<title>sendto: Operation not permitted</title>

<para>
When you try to ping the VPN interfaces, if you get a
"sendto: Operation not permitted" error, you are probably running
into a firewall on the local machine that is denying packets before they
even reach the VPN network interface.  Your firewall must allow
SSH traffic over your regular network <emphasis>and</emphasis>
it must allow all traffic over your VPN interfacess.

ipchains -I output 1 -i ppp1 -d 192.168.3.0/24 -j ACCEPT

<para>
ppp1 must, of course, be the network interface of your PPP-SSH

You only need to read this section if you're trying to connect
networks, not just hosts.  I assume your host-to

server computers can exchange pings flawlessly.  Now, it's time
to allow networks connected to the client and server machines to
use the tunnel as well.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Forwarding</title>

<para>
First of all, you need to be sure that you're allowing packets
to be forwarded across your interfaces.  You turn this on through
the proc configuration interface.  It's best to do this once at
boot time, but you can also put it in the vpn-pppssh script or even
create a script in the /etc/init.d/ip-up.d directory (see
<xref linkend="conndialup">) if you want.

</para>
</callout>
</calloutlist>

</sect2>


<sect2>
<title>Gatewaying</title>

<para>
On all computers in the subnet, you need to set up the local VPN host as the
gateway to all the networks on the other side of the tunnel.
This just tells the
computers "if you have any packets destined for the opposite side of
the VPN, send them to the local VPN host".
Note that if the VPN host
is already the default gateway for all the computers, then you don't need
to worry about this step -- the packets will be forwarded automatically.
</para>

<para>
In the example below, my VPN host has IP address 192.168.1.1 on the local network.
and IP address 192.168.3.2 on the VPN network.  The VPN network, containing both
the client and server VPN interfaces and all computers on the opposite side of the
link, is 192.168.3.0/24.
Therefore, on every local computer that I want to be able to send packets through
the VPN, I need to run the following command:

<screen>
# route add -net 192.168.3.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.1
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Now, any packet destined for the 192.168.3.0/24 network on the local machine
will be relayed to host 192.168.1.1 on the local network to be forwarded through
the VPN.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Routing</title>

<para>
There should be no need to set up custom routing -- pppd 
tries to do it all for you.  However, if you find that pppd
doesn't cover your needs, the place for your routing commands is in
the vpn-pppssh script itself.  To change the routing on the client,
simply run route.  To change the route on the server, use
ssh to send those commands to the server.
Here's an example:
</para>

<screen>
route add -net $NET1 gw $SERVER_IFIPADDR
ssh -o Batchmode=yes $SERVER_HOSTNAME -l$SERVER_USERNAME route add -net $NET2 gw $CLIENT_IFIPADDR
</screen>

</sect2>


<sect2>
<title>Masquerading</title>

<para>
You can even set up one or both hosts to masquerade all
connections through the VPN tunnel.
See the &masqhowto; for more.
</para>

<screen>
# ipchains -A forward -i ppp1 -s 192.168.0.0/24 -j MASQ
</screen>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Now try it</title>

<para>
That should be all you need to forward packets from subnets
connected to the client or server to the opposite machine.
May your PPP-SSH VPNs serve you quietly and reliably for many
years to come.
