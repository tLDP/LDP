<title>Introduction</title>
<para>The purpose of this guide is to provide an easy solution for limiting incoming
traffic, thus preventing our LAN
users from consuming all the bandwidth of our internet link.</para>
<para>This is useful when our internet link is slow or our LAN users
download tons of mp3s and the newest Linux distro's *.iso files.</para>

<title>Before We Start</title>
<para>Let's imagine the following situation:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>We have 115,2 kbits/s ppp (modem) internet link (115,2/10
= 11,5 kbytes/s); yes, there are such types of connection! With eth connections
(network card) we divide 115,2 by 8; with ppp we divide by 10, because
of start/stop bits (8 + 1 + 1 = 10).</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>We have some LAN stations and their users are doing bulk downloads
all the time.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>We want web pages to open fast, no matter how
many dowloads are happening.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Our internet interface is <command>ppp0</command>.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Our LAN interface is <command>eth0</command>.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Our network is 192.168.1.0/24</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<sect2>
<title>What do we need</title>
<para>Believe it or not, shaping the incoming traffic is an easy
task and you don't have to read tons of books about routing or queuing algorithms.
</para>
<para>To make it work, we need at least Squid proxy; if we want to fine tune
it, we will have to get familiar with ipchains or iptables and CBQ.</para>
<para>To test our efforts, we can install IPTraf.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>How does it work?</title>
<para>Squid is probably the most advanced HTTP proxy server available for Linux.
It can help us save bandwidth in two ways:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The first is a main characteristic of proxy servers -- they keep downloaded
web pages, pictures, and other objects in memory or on a disk. So, if two people are 
requesting the same web page, it isn't downloaded from the internet,
but from the local proxy. </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Apart from normal caching, Squid has a special feature called delay
pools. Thanks to delay pools, it is possible to limit internet traffic in a
reasonable way, depending on so-called 'magic words', existing in any given
URL. For example, a magic word could be '.mp3', '.exe' or '.avi', etc.
Any distinct part of a URL (such as .avi) can be defined as a magic word.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>With that, we can tell the Squid to download these kinds of files at a
specified speed (in our example, it will be about 5 kbytes/s). If our
LAN users download files at the same time, they will be downloaded
at about 5 kbytes/s altogether, leaving remaining bandwidth for web pages,
e-mail, news, irc, etc.</para>
<para>Of course, the Internet is not only used for downloading files via web
pages (http or ftp). Later on, we will deal with limiting bandwidth for Napster,
Realaudio, and other possibilities.</para>
</sect2></sect1>

<sect1 id="install">
<title>Installing and Configuring Necessary Software</title>
<para>Here, I will explain how to install the necessary software
so that we can limit and test the bandwidth usage.</para>
<sect2>
<title>Installing Squid with the delay pools feature</title>
<para>As I mentioned before, Squid has a feature called delay pools, which
allows us to control download bandwidth. Unfortunately, in most distributions,
Squid is shipped without that feature.</para>
<para>So if you have Squid already installed, I must disappoint you -- you
need to uninstall it and do it once again with delay pools enabled in the
way I explain below. </para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>To get maximum performance from our Squid proxy, it's best
to create a separate partition for its cache, called /cache/. Its size should
be about 300 megabytes, depending on our needs.</para>
<para>If you don't know how to make a separate partition, you can create the 
/cache/ directory on
a main partition, but Squid performance can suffer a bit.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>We add a safe 'squid' user:
</para>
<para><literal># useradd -d /cache/ -r -s /dev/null squid >/dev/null 2>&amp;1
</literal></para>
<para>No one can log in as squid, including root.
</para>

<para>OK, when we have configured everything, we must make sure everything under <filename>
/opt/squid</filename> and <filename>/cache</filename> directories belongs
to user 'squid'. </para>
<para><command># chown -R squid:squid /opt/squid/</command></para>
<para><command># chown -R squid:squid /cache/</command></para>
<para>or</para>
<para><command># chown -R squid.squid /opt/squid/</command></para>
<para><command># chown -R squid.squid /cache/</command></para>
<para>Now everything is ready to run Squid. When we do it for the first time,
we have to create its cache directories: </para>
<para><command># /opt/squid/usr/bin/squid -z</command></para>
<para>We run Squid and check if everything is working. A good tool to do that
is IPTraf; you can find it on <ulink url="http://freshmeat.net">http://freshmeat.net
</ulink>. Make sure you have set the appropriate proxy in your web browsers (192.168.1.1,
port 8080 in our example): </para>
<para><command># /opt/squid/usr/bin/squid</command></para>
<para>If everything is working, we add <filename>/opt/squid/usr/bin/squid
</filename> line to the end of our initializing scripts. Usually, it can
be <filename>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</filename>. </para>
<para>Other helpful options in Squid may be:</para>
<para><command># /opt/squid/usr/bin/squid -k reconfigure</command> (it reconfigures
Squid if we made any changes in its squid.conf file)</para>
<para><command># /opt/squid/usr/bin/squid -help</command> :) self-explanatory
</para>
<para>You can also copy <filename>cachemgr.cgi</filename> to the cgi-bin directory
of your WWW server.</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Solving remaining problems</title>
<para>OK, we have installed Squid and configured it to use delay pools. I
bet nobody wants to be restricted, especially our clever LAN users. They will
likely try to avoid our limitations, just to download their favourite mp3s
a little faster (and thus causing your headache).</para>
<para>I assume that you use IP-masquerade on your LAN so that your users
can use IRC, ICQ, e-mail, etc. That's OK, but we must make
sure that our LAN users will use our delay pooled Squid to access web pages
and use <filename>ftp</filename>.</para>
<para>We can solve most of these problems by using <filename>ipchains</filename> (Linux
2.2.x kernels) or <filename>iptables</filename> (Linux 2.4.x kernels).</para>
<sect3>
<title>Linux 2.2.x kernels (ipchains)</title>
<para>We must make sure that nobody will try to cheat and use a proxy
server other than ours. Public proxies usually run on 3128 and 8080 ports:</para>
<para><command>/sbin/ipchains -A input -s ! 192.168.1.1 -d ! 192.168.1.1 3128
-p TCP -j REJECT</command></para>
<para><command>/sbin/ipchains -A input -s ! 192.168.1.1 -d ! 192.168.1.1 8080
-p TCP -j REJECT</command></para>
<para>We must also make sure that nobody will try to cheat and connect to the
internet directly (IP-masquerade) to download web pages:</para>
<para><command>/sbin/ipchains -A input -s ! 192.168.1.1 -d ! 192.168.1.1 http
-p TCP -j REDIRECT 8080</command></para>
<para><command>/sbin/ipchains -A input -s ! 192.168.1.1 -d ! 192.168.1.1 https
-p TCP -j REDIRECT 8080</command></para>
<para>If everything is working, we add these lines to the end of our initializing
scripts. Usually, it can be <literal>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</literal>.</para>
<para>We might think to block <filename>ftp</filename> traffic (ports
20 and 21) to force our LAN users to use Squid, but it's not a good idea
for at least two reasons:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Squid is a http proxy with <filename>ftp</filename> support,
not a real <filename>ftp</filename> proxy. It can download from <filename>
ftp</filename>, it can also upload to some <filename>ftp</filename>, but it
can't delete/change name of files on remote <filename>ftp</filename> servers.
</para>
<para>When we block ports 20 and 21, we won't be able to delete/change name
of files on remote <filename>ftp</filename> servers.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>IE5.5 has a bug (at least mine has) -- it doesn't use a proxy
to retrieve the <filename>ftp</filename> directory. Instead it connects directly
via IP-masquerade.</para>
<para>When we block ports 20 and 21, we won't be able to browse through <filename>
ftp</filename> directories, using IE5.5.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>So, we will block excessive <filename>ftp</filename>
downloads using other methods. We will deal with it in chapter 4.</para>
</sect3>

<title>Linux 2.4.x kernels (iptables)</title>
<para>FIXME: Unfortunately, I don't know much about IP-tables, please help
:(((</para>
</sect3></sect2></sect1>

<sect1 id="cbq">
<title>Dealing with Other Bandwidth-consuming Protocols Using CBQ</title>
<para>We must remember that our LAN users can spoil our efforts from chapter
3, if they use Napster or Realaudio. We must also remember that we didn't
block <filename>ftp</filename> traffic in section 3.3.</para>
<para>We will achieve it in a different way -- not by limiting downloading directly,
but rather, indirectly. If our internet device is <literal>ppp0</literal>
and LAN device is <literal>eth0</literal>, we will limit outgoing traffic
on interface <literal>eth0</literal>, and thus, limit incoming traffic to <literal>
ppp0</literal>.</para>
<para>To do it, we will get familiar with CBQ and <filename>cbq.init</filename>
script. You can obtain it from <ulink url="ftp://ftp.equinox.gu.net/pub/linux/cbq/">
ftp://ftp.equinox.gu.net/pub/linux/cbq/</ulink>. Download <filename>cbq.init-v0.6.2
</filename> and put it in<filename> /etc/rc.d/</filename>.</para>
<para>You will also need <filename>iproute2</filename> installed. It comes
with every Linux distribution.</para>
<para>Now look in your <filename>/etc/sysconfig/cbq/</filename> directory.
There, you should have an example file, which should work with <filename>cbq.init
</filename>. If it isn't there, you probably don't have it compiled in your
kernel.</para>
<sect2>
<title>FTP</title>
<para>In chapter 3, we didn't block ftp for two reasons -- so that we could do uploads, 
and so
that users with buggy IE5.5 could browse through <filename>ftp</filename>
directories. In all, our web browsers and <filename>ftp</filename> programs
should make downloads via our Squid proxy and <filename>ftp</filename> uploads/renaming/deleting
should be made via IP-masquerade.</para>
<para>We create a file called <filename>cbq-10.ftp-network</filename> in the <filename>
/etc/sysconfig/cbq/</filename> directory:</para>
<para><command># touch /etc/sysconfig/cbq/cbq-10.ftp-network</command></para>
<para>We insert the following lines into it:</para>
<programlisting>DEVICE=eth0,10Mbit,1Mbit
RATE=10Kbit
WEIGHT=1Kbit
PRIO=5
RULE=:20,192.168.1.0/24
RULE=:21,192.168.1.0/24</programlisting>
<para>You will find the description of thses lines in <filename>cbq.init-v0.6.2 file
</filename>.</para>
<para>When you start <filename>/etc/rc.d/cbq.init-v.0.6.2</filename> script,
it will read your configuration, which is in <filename>/etc/sysconfig/cbq/</filename>:
</para>
<para><command># /etc/rc.d/cbq.init-v.0.6.2 start</command></para>
<para>If everything is working, we add <filename>/etc/rc.d/cbq.init-v.0.6.2 start
</filename> to the end of your initializing scripts. Usually, it can
be <filename>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</filename>.</para>
<para>Thanks to this command, your server will not send <filename>ftp</filename> data
through <filename>eth0</filename> faster than 10kbits/s, and thus will not
download <filename>ftp</filename> data faster than 10kbits/s. Your LAN users
will see that it's more efficient to use Squid proxy for doing <filename>
ftp</filename> downloads. They will be also able to browse <filename>ftp</filename>
directories using their buggy IE5.5.</para>
<para>There is also another bug in IE5.5 - when you right click on a file
in a <filename>ftp</filename> directory then select 'Copy To Folder',
the file is downloaded not through proxy, but directly through IP-masquerade,
thus omitting Squid with delay pools.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Napster, Realaudio, Windows Media and other issues</title>
<para>Here, the idea is the same as with <filename>ftp</filename>; we just
add another port and set a different speed.</para>
<para>We create file called <filename>cbq-50.napster-network</filename> in the <filename>
/etc/sysconfig/cbq/</filename> directory:</para>
<para><command># touch /etc/sysconfig/cbq/cbq-50.napsterandlive</command></para>
<para>Put these lines into that file:</para>
<programlisting>DEVICE=eth0,10Mbit,1Mbit

<title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>
<sect2>
<title>Is it possible to limit bandwidth on a per-user basis with delay pools?
</title>
<para>Yes. Look inside the original <filename>squid.conf</filename> file and
check the Squid documentation on <ulink url="http://www.squid-cache.org">http://www.squid-cache.org
</ulink></para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Is it possible to limit bandwidth on a per-user basis with <command>
cbq.init</command> script?</title>
<para>Yes. Look inside this script; there are some examples.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Delay pools are stupid; why can't I download something at full speed
when the network is used only by me?</title>
<para>Unfortunately, you can't do much about it.</para>
<para>The only thing you can do is to use <command>cron</command> and reconfigure
it, for example, at 1.00 am, so that Squid won't use delay pools, then reconfigure
it again, let's say at 7.30 am, to use delay pools.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>CBQ is stupi; why can't I download something at full speed when the
network is used only be me?</title>
<para>Lucky you, it's possible!</para>
<para>There are to ways to achieve it.</para>
<para>The first is the easy one, similar to the solution we made with Squid. To
do that, just look inside the <command>cbq.init</command><?Pub Caret> script.
</para>
<para>The second way is harder, but more intelligent. You can read about it in the Linux
2.4 Advanced Routing HOWTO.</para>
