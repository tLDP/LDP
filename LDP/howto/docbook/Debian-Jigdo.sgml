	<abstract><title>Abstract</title>

  <para>Getting Debian ISOs has always been a painful, slow and supremely inefficient process.
  Jigdo is a tool for distributing and obtaining Debian ISOs in an easy, fast and very efficient
  manner.  This HOWTO describes why you should use jigdo, a little bit about how it works and how
  you use it to get and update Debian ISOs.</para>

  <para>Jigdo is a very general tool, and isn't tied specifically to Debian ISOs.  The jigdo tools
  can be used to make any ISO available for download in the same easy, fast and efficient manner
  they're used for Debian ISOs.  This HOWTO will cover this as well, but we'll focus primarily on
  downloading Debian ISOs.</para>

      <para>I would like to thank the author of jigdo, <ulink
      url="mailto:atterer@debian.org">Richard Atterer</ulink>, simply for writing jigdo.  Anyone who
      has obtained Debian ISOs by other means will know why.  This HOWTO started out as some
      webpages I wrote about my experience with jigdo.  Richard took the time to email me extensive
      corrections, clarifications and answers to questions I had about jigdo.  Since then, he has
      read my work many times.  Richard is a developer who not only cares about his work, but also
      about the people who use it.  Sadly, this is becoming less common in this busy world we live
      in.  Thanks, Richard!</para>

      <para>I care a great deal about the people who use this document.  Even mini-HOWTOs take a
      long time to write, and I wouldn't have invested so much effort into something people don't
      understand.  If you have comments, corrections or suggestions, even in matters like writing
      style, don't hesitate to email me.  As long as I'm not totally swamped by my PhD
      dissertation and the book I'm writing on debugging code with GDB/DDD for No Starch Press, I'll
      do my best to respond to each email I receive about this mini-HOWTO.  News flash: I've
      completed my Ph.D.; now I'm swamped with job hunting.  Does anyone need to hire a theoretical
      physicist?</para>

<sect1 id="whyjigdo"><title>Why jigdo?</title>

    <sect2><title>How Does One Get A Debian ISO Image Set?</title>

      <para>If you want a set of Debian CDs there are many ways of getting them.  One way is to buy
      them from <ulink url="http://www.debian.org/CD/vendors/">vendors</ulink> who sell Debian CDs.
      This definitely has merit since some of the vendors donate money back to the Debian project.
      Your donations help make sure that Debian is around for a long time.</para>

      <para>Another way of getting a set of Debian CDs is to burn your own set.  This first entails
      obtaining an ISO image and then burning that ISO image to a blank CD.  Before jigdo, there
      were two ways of creating Debian CDs:</para>

			<orderedlist>
			<listitem><para>Downloading the entire ISO</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>Using the pseudo-image kit (PIK)</para></listitem>
			</orderedlist>

      <para>This document is about the newer and better way of obtaining Debian ISO images, using a
      tool called jigdo.   In fact, the PIK is now officially dead and all further references to it
      have been removed from this document.  The canonical method of getting Debian ISO images is
      with jigdo.</para>

		</sect2>



		<sect2 id="whynotdownloadthewholeisoimage"><title>Why Not Download The Whole ISO Image?</title>

      <para>There are mirrors which offer http and ftp downloads of Debian ISOs.  The problem is
      that there are very few mirror sites, and their bandwidth can't support everyone who wants
      Debian ISOs.  For example, fsn.hu has reportedly saturated the connection of its provider.
      The outgoing traffic reaches a few terabytes per month!</para>

      <para>In addition, Debian testing and unstable get updated often.  Your ISOs may become
      outdated the same day you download them unless you find some sneaky way of updating them like
      mounting the ISO on a loopback device and using rsync (which is what the PIK did).  So if you
      want up-to-date ISO images, you must download a new set of ISO images every day.  Clearly,
      this is not the way you want to obtain Debian ISOs!</para>

      <para>Even if you want to download the stable ISO images, they still get updated every few
      months.  Downloading the ISO images will give you up-to-date images for a few months, but
      every time a new revision of Debian stable is released, you'll need to go through the painful
      process of downloading the entire ISO set from scratch.  This is not a good use of your time
      and the mirror's resources.</para>

    </sect2>



    <sect2 id="whatisjigdo"><title>What Is Jigdo?</title>

      <para>Jigdo (which stands for "Jigsaw Download") was written by <ulink
      url="mailto:atterer@debian.org">Richard Atterer</ulink> and is released under the GNU GPL.
      It's a tool that allows efficient downloading and updating of an ISO image.  Any ISO image.
      Jigdo is not Debian specific, however Debian has chosen it to be the official method of
      downloading ISO images.</para>

      <para>A common misconception is that jigdo creates ISO images; it doesn't.  Let's discuss the
      overall process of how jigdo allows you to obtain an ISO image.  Let Adam (a Debian release
      manager) be the person offering the ISO image.  Let Betty (a Debian user) be the person who
      wants to download the ISO image.</para>


      <orderedlist>

      <listitem>
        <para>Adam first creates an ISO image suitable for burning a CD.  He might use a utility
        like <application>mkisofs</application> or <application>debian-cd</application> to create
        the ISO image.  He also creates two small files associated with his newly created image: a
        <filename>.jigdo</filename> file and a <filename>.template</filename> file.  He makes these
        two files available for download to anyone who wants to obtain his ISO image.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Betty then downloads the <filename>.jigdo</filename> and
        <filename>.template</filename> files.  She uses <application>jigdo-lite</application> along
        with these two files to download Adam's ISO image.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>When Debian gets updated, Adam creates a new version of the ISO and generates new
        <filename>.jigdo</filename> and <filename>.template</filename> files.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>When Betty wants to update her CDs, she downloads the new <filename>.jigdo</filename>
        and <filename>.template</filename> files and uses them with
        <application>jigdo-light</application> to update her copy of the ISO images.  The important
        thing here is that she only downloads the differences between her old ISO and Adam's new
        ISO.  She does not have to re-download the parts that are unchanged.</para>
      </listitem>

      </orderedlist>


      <para>Jigdo comes with two utilities: <application>jigdo-file</application> (used by Adam)
      which creates the <filename>.jigdo</filename> and <filename>.template</filename> files, and
      <application>jigdo-lite</application> (used by Betty) which uses these two files to download
      or update the ISO.  If all you want to do is obtain/update Debian ISOs, you'll only use
      <application>jigdo-lite</application>.  You can forget that jigdo-file even exists.  &nbsp;
      :-)</para>
      
      <para>Jigdo addresses all the problems with the other methods of obtaining Debian ISO
      images:</para>


			<itemizedlist>

			<listitem><para>It's much faster than downloading the entire ISO image.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Unlike downloading the entire ISO image, it can take an outdated CD (or a loop
      mounted outdated ISO image), download <emphasis>only</emphasis> the files that have changed
      since the CD (or ISO image) was created and create a new updated ISO.  Very similar to how you
      use cvs to update source code.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>jigdo-lite uses wget which, by default, uses http to transfer files.   Unlike
      rsync, http is never blocked by firewalls (except the ones behind which you shouldn't be using
      jigdo to begin with).</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Jigdo is very kind to the bandwidth of the servers offering the Debian images.
      The Debian mirrors can handle a bigger load of people using jigdo to download Debian images
      than with other methods of getting them.</para></listitem>

      </itemizedlist>


			<para>Clearly, jigdo is the best method of obtaining Debian ISO images.</para>

<sect1 id="howjigdoworks"><title>How Jigdo Works (optional)</title>

  <para>You don't need to know this material to download Debian ISOs, but it may help demystify how
  jigdo works.  If you're not interested in the details, simply fast forward to <xref
  linkend="downloadingyourfirstimage">, "How Do I Use Jigdo".</para>


    <sect2 id="preparingtheisofordownload"><title>Preparing The ISO For Download</title>

      <para>A CD image is a filesystem called iso9660, but for this discussion, we can safely talk
      about a CD image as being a big file called an "ISO image" (about 650MB) that contains files
      at various offsets.  For instance, if a CD contains a 567 byte file named README, the ISO
      image might contain the README file's contents between offsets 20480000 and 20480567.  You can
      visualize a CD image as:</para>

      <screen>
                    --------------------------------------------------------
      ISO Image:    |xxxx| file-0 |xx| file-1 |xxx| file-2 |x| file-3 |xxxx|
                    --------------------------------------------------------
      </screen>

      <para>The "x" areas of the image contain things like directory information, zero padding, disk
      name, boot block, etc.</para>

      <para><application>jigdo-file</application> takes two things as input: the complete CD image
      (so the ISO already needs to have been made) and a set of files which may or may not be in the
      image.  Here's a visualization of jigdo-file's input:</para>

      <screen>
                    --------------------------------------------------------
      ISO Image:    |xxxx| file-0 |xx| file-1 |xxx| file-2 |x| file-3 |xxxx|
                    --------------------------------------------------------

                         ----------  ----------              ----------    ----------
      Loose Files:       | file-0 |  | file-1 |              | file-3 |    | file-4 |
                         ----------  ----------              ----------    ----------
      </screen>

      <para>Through magic, jigdo-file finds out which of the loose files are contained in the ISO
      image and their offsets within the ISO file.  It outputs two files: a ".template" file and a
      ".jigdo" file.</para>

    </sect2>




    <sect2 id="the.templatefile"><title>The .template File</title>

      <para>Given an input of an ISO image and a set of files which may or may not be in the ISO
      image, jigdo-file outputs a .template file for that ISO image.  Here's what the
      <filename>.template</filename> file looks like:</para>

      <screen>
                    --------------------------------------------------------
      .template:    |xxxx| md5-0  |xx| md5-1  |xxx|cccccccc|x| md5-3  |xxxx|
                    --------------------------------------------------------
      </screen>

      <para>jigdo-file found that the files <filename>file-0</filename>, <filename>file-1</filename>
      and <filename>file-3</filename> were contained in the ISO image.  It removed the contents of
      the these files and replaced them with each file's md5 checksum (the
      <filename>md5-0</filename>, <filename>md5-1</filename>, etc).</para>

      <para>The "<literal remap="bf">x</literal>" data (directory information, zero padding, etc)
      within the ISO image is compressed and written to the .template file.  Finally, any files
      within the ISO image that weren't supplied as loose files (like <filename>file-2</filename>)
      are also compressed and written to the .template file.  This is shown as "<literal
      remap="bf">c</literal>" data in the .template file visualization.</para>

      <para>Loose files which were supplied to <application>jigdo-file</application> that aren't
      found in the ISO image (like <filename>file-4</filename>) are ignored.</para>

    </sect2>




    <sect2 id="the.jigdofile"><title>The .jigdo File</title>

      <para>Given an input of an ISO image and a set of loose files which may or may not be in the
      ISO image, jigdo-file outputs a .jigdo file for that ISO image.  The Debian .jigdo files are
      gzipped, so you need to use zcat or zless to view them.  Here's what a .jigdo file looks like
      when you gunzip it:</para>

      <screen>
      md5-0=http://somemirror.org/file-0
      md5-1=http://somemirror.org/file-1
      md5-2=http://somemirror.org/file-2
      md5-3=http://somemirror.org/file-3
      </screen>

      <para>The .jigdo file simply provides a mapping between the md5sum of a file within the ISO
      image and the download URL of that file.  There are some other things within the
      <filename>.jigdo</filename> file,
      and if you look through it, you'll see the <filename>.jigdo</filename> file has the same
      format as a ".ini" file.  It should be self explanatory, but if you want the nitty-gritty
      details, see the jigdo documentation.</para>

      <para>The format shown above is not quite what you'd see in a typical .jigdo file, but it's
      very similar.  If you look at the [Servers] section at the bottom of the .jigdo file, you'll
      see exactly what the difference is between what I showed above and an actual
      <filename>.jigdo</filename> file.</para>

    </sect2>




    <sect2 id="downloadingtheimage"><title>Downloading The Image</title>

      <para>Once you use <application>jigdo-file</application> to generate a
      <filename>.jigdo</filename> and .<filename>template</filename> file for an ISO image, anyone
      can use <application>jigdo-lite</application> to download that image.  jigdo-lite downloads
      all the files of a Debian ISO using <application>wget</application>, assembles them and forms
      a copy of the original ISO image on the fly.</para>

    </sect2>

</sect1>





<sect1 id="downloadingyourfirstimage"><title>Downloading Your First Image (In 5 Easy Steps)</title>

  <para>We'll assume that you're starting from scratch and don't have any Debian ISOs on hand.  Once
  you burn your set of ISOs, you can use jigdo-lite later to update them.  We'll cover updating your
  ISOs in the next section.</para>



		<sect2><title>Install Jigdo</title>

			<para>First install the jigdo-file package:</para>

			<screen>
      # apt-get install jigdo-file
      </screen>

      <para>Jigdo is under aggressive development.  Bug fixes and enhancements are constant, so if
      you're using stable or testing, download jigdo-file from unstable at <ulink url=
      "http://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/jigdo-file.html"
      >http://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/jigdo-file.html</ulink>.  As of 28 Nov 2005 it's at
      version 0.7.2-2.</para>

		</sect2>



		<sect2 id="downloadthe.templateand.jigdofiles"><title>Download The .template And .jigdo Files</title>

      <para>For each ISO image you want to download, you'll need both the .jigdo and .template file
      for that image.  Both files follow the same naming convention:</para>

      <screen>
      distro-arch-n.jigdo
      distro-arch-n.template
      </screen>

      <para>where distro is the name of the distro (like "sarge"), arch is the architecture (like
      "i386") and n is the disk number (like "1").</para>

      <para>For example, sarge has 8 images, so you need to download 8 .jigdo files and 8 .template
      files.  They can be downloaded from <ulink url="http://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/"
      >http://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/</ulink>.  The first .jigdo and .template file are named
      <filename>sarge-i386-1.jigdo</filename> and <filename>sarge-i386-1.template</filename>
      respectively.</para>

		<sect2 id="runjigdo-lite"><title>Run jigdo-lite</title>

      <para>Run <application>jigdo-lite</application> and give it the <filename>.jigdo</filename>
      file of the image you want to download.  Using Sarge as an example:</para>

      If you already have a previous version of the CD you are
      downloading, jigdo can re-use files on the old CD that are also
      present in the new image, and you do not need to download them

			<para>You'll see:</para>

			<screen>
      -----------------------------------------------------------------
      The jigdo file refers to files stored on Debian mirrors. Please
      choose a Debian mirror as follows: Either enter a complete URL
      pointing to a mirror (in the form
      `ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/'), or enter any regular expression
      for searching through the list of mirrors: Try a two-letter
      country code such as `de', or a country name like `United
      States', or a server name like `sunsite'.
      Debian mirror [http://linux.csua.berkeley.edu/debian/]: 
			</screen>

      <para>By default, <application>jigdo-lite</application> pulls the mirror from your
      <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list</filename>.  If you want to use a different mirror, you would
      specify a different mirror here.  If this is the mirror you want to use, press
      <keycap>ENTER</keycap>.  Jigdo-lite will then write a <filename>.jigdo-lite</filename> file in
      your home directory.</para>

      <para>Next, if the <filename>.jigdo</filename> file you're using references a package which
      needs to be downloaded from a Non-US server, <application>jigdo-lite</application> will prompt
      you for a Debian Non-US mirror.  The message displayed (and your response) will be very
      similar to the mirror dialog in the previous paragraph.</para>

			<screen>
      -----------------------------------------------------------------
      The jigdo file also refers to the Non-US section of the Debian
      archive. Please repeat the mirror selection for Non-US. Do not
      simply copy the URL you entered above; this does not work because
      the path on the servers differs!

      the image you're about to download doesn't contain Non-US software you won't see this
      dialog.</para>
			
      <para>If you want to change the default mirrors you use with jigdo at any time in the future,
      you can modify these two lines in <filename>~/.jigdo-lite</filename>:</para>

<sect1 id="updatingyourimage"><title>Updating Your Image</title>

  <para>Presumably, you've read the last section, followed the instructions, burned your newly
  created ISO files onto CD and are feeling warm and fuzzy.  Sooner or later, some packages will get
  updated and now you want to donate your old CDs to some newbie at your local LUG's installfest and
  burn yourself a set of updated CDs.  Since you're well on the way to becoming a jigdo-guru, we
  won't go into as much painful detail as we did in the last section.</para>

  <para>The first step is to download the .jigdo and .template files, again, for the images you want
  to update.  You may wonder why you need to download them a second time.  The reason is because the
  updated image you want to download has changed.  Files may have been added or deleted, but even if
  not, any updated packages or files will have a different checksum from the checksum listed in the
  .jigdo and .template files you used when you first downloaded the images.</para>

  <para>At this point, you're either holding an outdated Debian CD in your hand or you have the CD's
  outdated ISO image on your hard drive.  Let's go through the steps of getting an updated ISO file.
  If you have a CD, put it in your CD drive and mount it:</para>

	<screen>
      $ mount /cdrom
	</screen>

  <para>On the other hand, if you have an ISO file you'd like to update, mount it as a loop device
  (you may need to be root to do this).  Using Woody as an example:</para>

	<screen>
      # mount -o loop woody-i386-1.iso /mnt
	</screen>

  <para>Now run <application>jigdo-lite</application> with the <filename>.jigdo</filename> file as
  an argument.</para>

  <para>jigdo-lite is asking us to give it the location of your mounted CD (if you're updating a CD)
  or your loop mounted ISO file (if you're using the ISO file).  I'm using an ISO file loop mounted
  on <filename role="directory">/mnt</filename>, so I'll enter <filename
  role="directory">/mnt</filename>.  If you're updating a CD, enter the mount directory of your CD,
  which is most likely <literal>/cdrom</literal>.  In either case,
  <application>jigdo-lite</application> will scan the directory of your mounted media, determine
  which files need updating and re-use the files which don't need updating.  See also <xref
  linkend="more-about-scan">, "More About Scan Sources".</para>
  
  <para>You may see something like:</para>

      it or use --force
      jigdo-file failed with code 3 - aborting.
	</screen>


  <para>What happened?  Actually, I wanted to show you this because you'll bump into it sooner or
  later.  I'm updating an ISO file, but the outdated image file is in the same directory I'm working
  in.  Jigdo-lite wants to generate a file called <filename>woody-i386-1.iso</filename> but there's
  already a file by that name in the current directory (the outdated image).  Jigdo-lite doesn't
  want to destroy that file, so it bails and lets me know that I can either delete that file or use
  <literal>--force</literal> to overwrite the file.   You could also rename or move the file too,
  but I guess <application>jigdo-lite</application> assumes we already know this. &nbsp;  :-)</para>
	
  <para>Don't be timid about moving or renaming the image file just because it's loop mounted.  The
  filesystem uses inodes under the hood, and even if you move or rename the file, the inode stays
  the same.  You won't hurt the filesystem mounted under <filename role="directory">/mnt</filename>.
  As for deleting the ISO file, that won't hurt the mounted filesystem either.  A file's inode gets
  deallocated only when the inode's reference count drops to zero.  Mounting the ISO image bumps the
  reference count up, so the file really gets deleted only after you <command>rm</command> the file
  <emphasis>and</emphasis> umount the loop device.  All you people who are updating the CD don't
  have to worry about any of this.  :-)</para>

  <para>I'll rename the ISO file to <filename>woody-i386-1.iso.old</filename> and run
  <application>jigdo-lite</application> again.  Let's try again:</para>

      <para>It keeps asking this as long as you enter a path to scan. The idea is that you may want
      to scan several old CDs, so you can insert one after the other into the drive and keep

    <sect2><title>Jigdo Has Problems Downloading Certain Filenames.</title>

      <para>When downloading Debian images under Windows, jigdo-lite may appear to have trouble
      downloading one or more of the following files:</para>

      <screen>
      libbusiness-onlinepayment-bankofamerica-perl_xxx_all.deb
      libbusiness-onlinepayment-authorizenet-perl_xxx_all.deb
      libbusiness-onlinepayment-payconnect-perl_xxx_all.deb
      libmasonx-request-withapachesession-perl_xxx_all.deb
      libtemplate-plugin-calendar-simple-perl_xxx_all.deb
      </screen>

      <para>Move the jigdo download directory up by as many directories as possible, closer to the
      drives's root directory.</para>

      <para>The NTFS filesystem has a 255 character limit on a file's pathname.  When jigdo-lite
      downloads files from the internet, it makes a copy of the server directory structure in its
      download directory.  With their very long names, the above Debian packages may exceed the
      allowed path length, which leads to error messages like "<literal>Cannot write to `[very long
      pathname]' (No such file or directory)</literal>".</para>


      <para>Some people may now wonder: Why does jigdo-lite use wget's
      "<literal>--force-directories</literal>" switch, which creates these problematic directory
      hierarchies?</para>

      <para>Early versions of jigdo-lite did not use it, but then some folks requested that
      jigdo-lite always use the "<literal>--continue</literal>" switch to avoid half-downloaded
      .deb files being ignored and deleted when you interrupt and restart jigdo-lite.</para>

      <para>Unfortunately, it turned out that this led to problems: The Debian servers contained
      several identically named files (e.g. "<literal>root.bin</literal>") in different directories,
      and if you interrupted jigdo-lite at roughly the right time during the download, the chances
      were high that the resumed download would append data to the wrong half-downloaded file,
      corrupting it and making the entire jigdo download fail.</para>

    </sect2>



    <sect2 id="useproxy"><title>How do I make jigdo use my proxy?</title>

      <para>Edit <filename>~/.jigdo-lite</filename> (or <filename>jigdo-lite-settings.txt</filename>
      for the Microsoft Windows version) into a text editor and find the line that starts with
      "<literal>wgetOpts</literal>".  The following switches can be added to that line:</para>

      <screen>
      -e ftp_proxy=http://LOCAL-PROXY:PORT/
      -e http_proxy=http://LOCAL-PROXY:PORT/
      --proxy-user=USER
      --proxy-passwd=PASSWORD
      </screen>

      <para>Of course, substitute the correct values for your proxy server.  The last two options
      are only necessary if your proxy uses password authentication.  The switches need to be added
      to the end of the wgetOpts line before the final <literal>'</literal> character.  All options
      must be on one line.</para>

      <para>Alternatively, under Linux you can also set up the <varname>ftp_proxy</varname> and
      <varname>http_proxy</varname> environment variables, for example in the file
      <filename>/etc/environment</filename> or <filename>~/.bashrc</filename>.</para>

    <sect2><title>Jigdo-lite fails with an error - have I downloaded all those MBs in vain?</title>

      <para>If <application>jigdo-file</application> aborts after downloading a considerable chunk
      of the ISO contents, you'll have a large "<literal>.iso.tmp</literal>" file.  There are
      several things to try to salvage your download:</para>

      <itemizedlist>

      <listitem><para>Restart the download by pressing <keycap>RETURN</keycap>.  Maybe some of the
      files could not be downloaded because of timeouts or other transient errors.  Try to download
      the missing files again.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Try a different mirror.  Some Debian mirrors are slightly out of sync -- maybe
      a different mirror still holds files that were deleted from the one you specified, or it has
      already been updated with files that are not yet present on your mirror.  This has happened
      quite a few times with me.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Retrieve the missing parts of the image using <ulink
      url="http://rsync.samba.org">rsync</ulink>.  First, you need to find out the correct rsync URL
      of the image you are downloading: Choose a server that offers rsync access to the <ulink
      url="http://www.debian.org/CD/mirroring/rsync-mirrors">stable</ulink> or <ulink
      url="http://www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/#testing">testing</ulink> images, then determine the

        <para>Next, remove the "<literal>.tmp</literal>" extension from jigdo-lite's temporary file
        by renaming it, and pass both the remote URL and the local filename to rsync: <command>rsync
        rsync://server.org/path/binary-i386-1.iso binary-i386-1.iso</command> You may want to use
        rsync's <literal>--verbose</literal> and <literal>--progress</literal> switches to get
        status messages, and <literal>--block-size=8192</literal> to increase its
        speed.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Under Linux, you can loop-mount the <literal>.tmp</literal> file to access the
      packages that were already downloaded, and reuse them for generating an image from a newer
      .jigdo file.  To do this, first issue the following commands as root in the directory
      with the broken download: <command>mkdir mnt; mount -t iso9660 -o loop *.tmp mnt</command>.
      Next, start a new download in a different directory, and enter the path of the mnt directory
      at the "Files to scan" prompt.</para>
      
      <para>Under Microsoft Windows you can do the same thing by loop mounting the temporary ISO
      image using "virtual drive" software.  <application><ulink

      <title>[11 Aug 2002]: Why aren't the translations of this HOWTO on LDP?</title>

      <para>I've been having trouble getting the translations of this HOWTO submitted to the
      non-English LDP editors.</para>

      <para>The German LDP editor, Marco Budde <email>Budde@tu-harburg.de</email> refuses to accept
      the German translation because it was written in Docbook and not Linuxdoc, even though Docbook
      is the preferred SGML language for the LDP.  It's a shame that we have people within the open
      source community who would sabotage our community from the inside.</para>
			
      <para>The Portuguese LDP editor, Alfredo Carvalho <email>ajpc@poli.org</email>, has completely
      ignored my submission of the Portuguese translation.</para>
			
      <para>If you care about having LDP documents in these languages, I urge you to write to these
      editors and ask them to please be more responsible about accepting translated documents.  For
      the time being, you can download these translations from my personal website, <ulink

		<sect2 id="interrupted"><title>What do I do if my jigdo download gets interrupted?</title>

      <para>If your download gets interrupted, all you need to do is restart jigdo-lite and hit
      <keycap>ENTER</keycap> at all the question prompts.  Jigdo-lite will pick up where it left
      off.</para>

		</sect2>



    <sect2><title>My jigdo download won't complete because the .jigdo file is broken.  When I
    download a new, fixed .jigdo file, do I need to download all the data over again?</title>

      <para>You may find that the .jigdo file you downloaded is broken.  It's uncommon, but it does
      happen from time to time with moving targets like Debian testing or unstable.</para>

      <para>If you find that <filename>.jigdo</filename> is broken, you'll need to download a new
      .jigdo file (when a fixed one becomes available), but you <emphasis>won't</emphasis> need to
      download all the ISO data again.</para>

      <para>You can use the same loop mounting trick we use when updating an ISO image.  The
      difference is that there's no finished .iso file to start with, but the .iso.tmp file is an
      ISO image too and can be used to finish the download without having to re-download all the
      data that was downloaded before the broken .jigdo file caused jigdo-lite to halt.  Simply loop
      mount the .iso.tmp file on <filename role="directory">/mnt</filename> and when you re-run
      jigdo-lite with the fixed .jigdo file, tell jigdo-lite to scan <filename
      role="directory">/mnt</filename>.  Don't forget to rename or move the .iso.tmp file so it
      doesn't interfere with jigdo-lite which will want to create a new .iso.tmp file.</para>

		</sect2>



		<sect2 id="dvdsizedimages"><title>Can I use jigdo to download images for DVD?</title>

      <para>Absolutely; the process is identical to downloading CD images.  The only thing you need
      to do differently is to download the .jigdo and .template files for DVDs instead of CDs.  You
      can find the DVD .jigdo and .template files at <ulink
      url="http://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/">http://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/</ulink>.</para>

      <para>On Linux, you need kernel 2.4 or later to create DVD-sized files.</para>
      
      <para>Under MS Windows, you need to use <literal>jigdo-win-0.7.1a</literal> (released 21 July
      2004) or later to create DVD-sized images.  This is because of a bug in the large file support
      of Mingw32, the compiler used to create the MS Windows executables.  The bug got fixed on this
      date, and <literal>jigdo-win-0.7.1a</literal> was released.</para>

		<sect2><title>Can I burn the <filename>.iso.tmp</filename> file to CD?</title>

      <para>Thanks to Gordon Huff and David Anselmi, we now know the answer is "yes you can".   But
      more importantly, Gordon gave a good reason why you'd want to do this in the first place.
      Paraphrasing Gordon:</para>

      <blockquote>
      <para>My friend's Win98 has a *nice* cable connection.  I arrive in the morning, start jigdo
      (more than one, actually) and then we go to the store, tie back the kiwi plant, put up the
      Christmas lights and Christmas tree, trim the tree, order and split a pizza and fire up the
      satellite dish.</para>

      <para>I leave my friends place with several iso.tmp's on CDRWs.  When I get home, I use the
      iso's that didn't finish to update my jigdo setup at home which is a dial-up.</para>
      </blockquote>

		<sect2><title>Jigdo-lite is broken!  It downloads packages and deletes them.  I know it doesn't write them to the
		<filename>iso.tmp</filename> file because the file size doesn't change!</title>

      <para>Jigdo works just fine -- the <filename>.iso.tmp</filename> file is created at the
      beginning with its final size, but filled with zero bytes.  Later, parts of it are overwritten
      with the downloaded data.</para>

      <para>You can tell that jigdo is making progress by looking at the messages "<literal>Found X
      of the Y files required by the template</literal>" that are printed from time to time.  The
      first value "<literal>X</literal>" should increase.  When <literal>X</literal> equals
      <literal>Y</literal>, the download is finished.</para>

    <sect2 id="scanmultipleimages"><title>For image updates, I want jigdo-lite to scan 14
    loop-mounted images in one go.  How can I do this?</title>

      <para>When updating CD images, it's tiresome to keep loop-mounting and unmounting images.
      However, by default the Linux kernel only supports eight loop devices, and jigdo-lite's menu
      of previously entered paths only has five entries.</para>

      <para>To scan many loop-mounted images, you must first tell the Linux kernel to support more
      than the default eight devices.  This is done by giving the "<literal>max_loop</literal>"
      parameter to the module when loading it, e.g. with "<literal>modprobe loop
      max_loop=16</literal>" on the command line or by adding the line "<literal>options loop
      max_loop=16</literal>" to <filename>/etc/modules.conf</filename>.  In Debian, you must put
      this line into a file named e.g. <filename>/etc/modutils/local-loop</filename> and then run
      <command>update-modules</command> because direct changes to
      <filename>/etc/modules.conf</filename> will be overwritten.</para>

      <para>Having mounted the individual images, you can pass the parent directory of their mount
      points to jigdo-lite for scanning.  For example, if the images are mounted under <filename
      role="directory">/mnt/myloopmounts/image1/</filename> etc., pass "<filename
      role="directory">/mnt/myloopmounts</filename>" as the path to scan.  If passing the parent
      directory is inconvenient, you can also create a directory and fill it with symlinks to the
      mount points.</para>

    </sect2>



		<sect2 id="wgetoptions"><title>Jigdo-lite is too verbose.  How can I supress some or all of its messages?</title>

      <para>Jigdo-lite uses wget, and wget's output can be quite verbose.  If this is unsettling,
      you can make wget more quiet by adding <literal>--non-verbose</literal> to the
      <literal>wgetOpts</literal> switch in your <filename>~/.jigdo-lite</filename> file.  If you
      want wget to print no messages at all, use <literal>--quiet</literal> in the
      <literal>wgetOpts</literal> switch.</para>

    </sect2>



    <sect2 id="otherplatforms"><title>Can I use jigdo on platforms other than Linux?</title>

      <para>Certainly.  If you're interested in Potato or Woody under Microsoft Windows, old SunOS,
      HP-UX and IRIX you can use jigdo-easy.  See <xref linkend="jigdo-easy"> and <xref
      linkend="links">.</para>

      <para>If you want to download Potato, Woody, Sarge or Sid under Microsoft Windows, jigdo-lite
      has been ported to that platform and can be downloaded from the main jigdo site (<xref
      linkend="links">).</para>

		</sect2>



    <sect2><title>On MS Windows, why do I get a "<literal>No such file or directory</literal>" error message?</title>

      <para>You might find that under MS Windows, jigdo-lite will download some files but then fail
      to read their contents, which will produce a "<literal>No such file or directory</literal>"
      error message.</para>

      <para>It seems that this occurs if the length of the filenames that jigdo processes exceeds a
      certain limit. The solution is to move the half-finished download up in the directory
      hierarchy, closer to the top-level directory of the drive.</para>

        </sect2>

    <sect2><title>On MS Windows, why won't my image grow larger than 2GB?</title>

      <para>You're using an old version of jigdo.  Please upgrade to
      <literal>jigdo-win-0.7.1a </literal> or newer.  See <xref linkend="dvdsizedimages">.</para>

    </sect2>


    <sect2><title>On MS Windows, <filename>jigdo-lite.bat</filename> fails with an error message
    saying "sh" was not found.</title>

      <para>This means that the <literal>PATH</literal> command in the <literal>.bat</literal> file failed.  For some
      reason, this is the case if you unpacked jigdo on a Windows network share using a path like
      "<filename role="directory">\\SomeServer\Files\jigdo</filename>".  Solution: Use "<command>Map
      network drive</command>" (in the explorer "tools" menu) to assign a drive letter like
      "<literal>Z:</literal>", then double-click on the <literal>.bat</literal> file inside
      "<literal>Z:\jigdo</literal>".  Alternatively, a workaround is to move
      everything in the <filename role="directory">jigdo-bin</filename> subdirectory up to where the
      <literal>.bat</literal> file is.</para>

    </sect2>


    <sect2><title>Can I run multiple instances of jigdo-lite to download images in parallel?</title>
      <para>Absolutely.  However, to avoid filename clashing, you should run each
      <application>jigdo-lite</application> instance in its own separate directory.  You can start
      as many instances as you want, go to bed, and when you wake up, all the ISO images will be
      waiting for you on your hard drive.  Be aware that <application>jigdo-lite</application> is
      bandwidth and CPU intensive, so you won't want to use your computer with multiple instances
      running in tandem.</para>
    </sect2>



		<sect2><title>Is there a GUI interface available?</title>

      <para>A GTK+ interface to jigdo is being worked on.  Both Linux and Microsoft Windows GUI
      clients are planned.  Unfortunately, it's been 80% done for over 1.5 years, so don't hold your
      breath for its release.</para>

		<sect2 id="jigdo-easy"><title>jigdo-easy</title>

      <para>Jigdo-easy, by Anne Bezemer, is a fork of <application>jigdo-lite</application> which is
      portable to a wider range of systems, including Microsoft Windows, old SunOS, HP-UX and IRIX).
      It's also easier to use than jigdo-lite but because of changes made to Jigdo, will only work
      with Potato and Woody.  Jigdo-easy will not be able to download Sarge and Sid.  See <xref
      linkend="links"> and <xref linkend="otherplatforms">.</para>

		</sect2>



    <sect2 id="more-about-scan"><title>More About Scan Sources</title>

      <para>By now you know that when <application>jigdo-lite</application> asks for files to scan,
      you can use 3 sources:</para>


      <itemizedlist mark='bullet'>

        <listitem><para>A mounted copy of an outdated CD or DVD that you wish to
        update.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>A loop-mounted copy of an outdated ISO image file on your hard
        drive.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>A loop-mounted copy of the temporary <filename>.iso.tmp</filename> file,
        when a previous <application>jigdo-lite</application> run aborted.</para></listitem>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>As Jens Seidel points out, there is another, rather crafty, source you should use for a
      scanning source: your apt cache.  Apt uses the directory <filename
      role="directory">/var/cache/apt/archives</filename> for cache.  There will be many Debian
      packages sitting in this directory, and they can be used for a scan source for
      <application>jigdo-lite</application>!  So when you're asked for a directory to scan, by all
      means, use this directory too.</para>

      <para>If you're editing the <filename>~/.jigdo-lite</filename> file by hand, be aware that
      multiple scan directories are space separated, for example:</para>

      <screen>
      scanMenu='/var/cache/apt/archives/ /cdrom/'
      </screen>

    </sect2>



		<sect2 id="jigdo-file-cache"><title>jigdo-file-cache.db</title>

      <para>The cache contains the md5sums of files read when you supply a directory at the
      <literal>Files to scan:</literal> prompt.  If you have jigdo-file scan the same directory a
      second time, the scan will be very fast.</para>

      <para>This could be useful in the following case: rev0 gets updated to rev1.  With the rev1 CD
      images, some packages may have been pushed from CD <literal>n</literal> to CD
      <literal>n+1</literal>, or vice versa.  If you had a particularly slow link (e.g.  modem),
      you'd try to avoid downloading these packages again.  For this reason, when downloading the
      new version of CD <literal>n</literal>, you'd let jigdo-lite scan the three CDs
      <literal>n-1</literal>, <literal>n</literal> and <literal>n+1</literal> (or even all 8 CDs if
      you want to be 100% sure).</para>

      <para>If you have jigdo-lite scan the same CDs over and over again while updating each of the
      8 CD images, the cache will prevent all the data on the CDs from being read multiple
      times.</para>

      <para>The cache is much more important when <emphasis>generating</emphasis> jigdo files,
      because you don't want jigdo-file to read in your whole 50GB Debian mirror for every generated
      jigdo file.</para>
