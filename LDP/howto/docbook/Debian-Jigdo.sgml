	<abstract><title>Abstract</title>

	<para>Getting Debian ISOs has always been a painful, slow and supremely inefficient process.  Jigdo is a new tool for
	obtaining Debian ISOs in an easy, fast and very efficient manner.  This HOWTO describes why you should use jigdo, a little
	bit about how it works and how you use it to get and update Debian ISOs.</para>

	<para>Jigdo is a very general tool, and isn't tied specifically to Debian ISOs.  The jigdo tools can be used to make any ISO
	available for download in the same easy, fast and efficient manner they're used for Debian ISOs.  This HOWTO will cover this
	as well, but we'll focus primarily on downloading Debian ISOs.</para>

			<para>Originally, I was going to thank the author of jigdo, <ulink url="mailto:atterer@debian.org">Richard
			Atterer</ulink>, simply for writing jigdo.  Anyone who has obtained Debian ISOs by other means will know why.  However, my
			thanks needs to go further.  This HOWTO started out as some webpages I wrote about my experience with jigdo.  Richard took
			the time to email me extensive corrections, clarifications and answers to questions I had about jigdo.  Since then, he has
			read my work many times.  Richard is a developer who not only cares about his work, but also about the people who use it.
			Sadly, this is becoming less common in this busy world we live in.  Thanks, Richard!</para>

<sect1 id="whyjigdo"><title>Why jigdo?</title>

		<sect2><title>How Does One Get A Debian ISO Image Set?</title>

			<para>If you want your own set of Debian CDs there are many ways of getting them.  One way is to buy them from <ulink
			url="http://www.debian.org/CD/vendors/">vendors</ulink> who sell Debian CDs.  This has some merit since some of the
			vendors donate money back to the Debian project.  Your donations help make sure that Debian is around for a long
			time.</para>


			<para>Another way of getting a set of Debian CDs is to burn your own set.  This first entails obtaining an ISO image and
			then burning that ISO image to a blank CD.  Before jigdo, there were two ways of creating Debian CDs:</para>
	

			<orderedlist>
			<listitem><para>Downloading the entire ISO</para>
			<listitem><para>Using the pseudo-image kit (PIK)</para>
			</orderedlist>

			<para>This document is about the new and better way of obtaining Debian ISO images, using a tool called jigdo.   In fact,
			the PIK is now deprecated.  The canonical method of getting Debian ISO images is with jigdo.</para>

		</sect2>




		<sect2 id="whynotdownloadthewholeisoimage"><title>Why Not Download The Whole ISO Image?</title>

			<para>There are mirrors which offer http and ftp downloads of Debian ISOs.  The problem is that there are very few mirror
			sites, and their bandwidth can't support everyone who wants Debian ISOs.  For example, fsn.hu has reportedly saturated
			the connection of its provider.  The outgoing traffic reaches a few terabytes per month!</para>

			<para>In addition, Debian testing and unstable get updated often.  Your ISOs may become outdated the same day you
			download them unless you find some sneaky way of updating them like mounting the ISO on a loopback device and using rsync
			(which is what the PIK does).  So if you want up-to-date ISO images, you must download a new set of ISO images every day.
			Clearly, this is not the way you want to obtain Debian ISOs!</para>

			<para>Even if you want to download the stable ISO images, they still get updated every few months.  Downloading the ISO
			images will give you up-to-date images for a few months, but every time a new revision of Debian stable is released,
			you'll need to go through the painful process of downloading the entire ISO set from scratch.  This is not a good use of
			your time and the mirror's resources.</para>




		<sect2 id="whynotusethewholepik"><title>Why Not Use The Pseudo Image Kit (PIK)?</title>
	
			<para>The PIK addresses most of the problems of downloading entire ISO images.   The downloads are fast, and the PIK uses
			rsync to update only those portions of an ISO image that need to be updated, so it's an efficient way of keeping your ISO
			set up-to-date.  However, there are some hefty problems with the PIK:</para>

			<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>It's difficult to use and not very user friendly.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>You can't use the PIK to download testing and unstable ISO sets.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>The PIK relies on rsync which is CPU-intensive for the server.  If too many people use PIK with the same
				server, it would go up in smoke.  Even if the PIK is made more friendly for the user, it's unacceptably unfriendly for
				the mirrors.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>The PIK uses rsync, which is blocked by many of the stricter firewalls.  So even if you wanted to use that
				nice fast corporate network at work, you might run into problems using the PIK.
			<listitem><para>Each image needs to be stored on the server.  That was OK in the good old Potato days, when the 28 CD
				images "only" took 17 GB.  Starting with Woody, the 96 CDs need 57 GB or so.  Now imagine that we also want to offer
				DVDs and this figure doubles.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

		</sect2>




		<sect2 id="whatisjigdo"><title>What Is Jigdo?</title>

			<para>Jigdo (which stands for "Jigsaw Download") was written by <ulink url="mailto:atterer@debian.org">Richard
			Atterer</ulink> and is released under the GNU GPL.  It's a tool that allows efficient downloading and updating of an ISO
			image.  Any ISO image.  Jigdo is not Debian specific, however Debian has chosen it to be the prefered method of
			downloading ISO images.</para>
			
			<para>The jigdo tool comes with two utilities:</para>
			
			<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>jigdo-file is used by the person offering the ISO image.  It enables anyone to download that image by
				creating a .jigdo and .template file for the image.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>jigdo-lite is used by people who want to download the ISO image.  It downloads the image using the
				image's .jigdo and .template files which were created by jigdo-file.  If your main concern is simply downloading Debian
				ISO images, you'll just be using jigdo-lite.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			
			<para>A common misconception is that jigdo creates ISO images; it doesn't.  Jigdo-file simply allows people to download
			an ISO image by creating a .jigdo and .template file.  The people who want to download the ISO image will get these two
			files and use jigdo-lite to download the image.  The ISO image needs to be made in advance, before jigdo-file is used,
			and that's usually done with a utility like mkisofs or debian-cd.</para>

			<para>Jigdo addresses all the problems with the other two methods of obtaining Debian ISO images:</para>

			<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>It's much faster than downloading the entire ISO image.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>Unlike downloading the entire ISO image, it can take an outdated CD (or a loop mounted outdated ISO
				image), download <emphasis>only</emphasis> the files that have changed since the CD (or ISO image) was created and
				create a new updated ISO.  Very similar to how you use cvs to update source code.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>jigdo-lite is much easier to use than the PIK.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>jigdo-lite uses wget which, by default, uses http to transfer files.  The PIK uses rsync.  While rsync
				may be blocked by some firewalls, the only firewalls that block http are the ones from which you shouldn't be using
				jigdo to begin with.  You'll almost never run into firewall problems with jigdo-lite.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>jigdo-lite is much more user friendly than the PIK.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>jigdo-lite is much more server friendly than the PIK.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

			<para>Clearly, jigdo is the best method of obtaining Debian ISO images.</para>

<sect1 id="howjigdoworks"><title>How Jigdo Works (optional)</title>

	<para>You don't need to know this material to use jigdo, but it may help demystify what jigdo does.  If you're not interested
	in the details, simply fast forward to <xref linkend="downloadingyourfirstimage">, "How Do I Use Jigdo".</para>

  <para>There are two components to jigdo:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>jigdo-file: Prepares an ISO for download (used by the person offering the ISO)</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>jigdo-lite: Downloads the ISO (used by the person downloading the ISO)</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>


    <sect2 id="preparingtheisofordownload"><title>Preparing The ISO For Download</title>

			<para>A CD image is a filesystem called iso9660, but for this discussion, we can safely talk about a CD image as being a
			big file called an "ISO image" (about 650MB) that contains files at various offsets.  For instance, if a CD contains a 567
			byte file named README, the ISO image might contain the README file's contents between offsets 20480000 and 20480567.  You
			can visualize a CD image as:</para>

      <screen>
                    --------------------------------------------------------
      ISO Image:    |xxxx| file-0 |xx| file-1 |xxx| file-2 |x| file-3 |xxxx|
                    --------------------------------------------------------
      </screen>

			<para>The "x" areas of the image contain things like directory information, zero padding, disk name, boot block,
			etc.</para>

			<para>jigdo-file takes two things as input: the complete CD image (so the ISO already needs to have been made) and a set
			of files which may or may not be in the image.  Here's a visualization of jigdo-file's input:</para>

      <screen>
                    --------------------------------------------------------
      ISO Image:    |xxxx| file-0 |xx| file-1 |xxx| file-2 |x| file-3 |xxxx|
                    --------------------------------------------------------

                         ----------  ----------              ----------    ----------
      Loose Files:       | file-0 |  | file-1 |              | file-3 |    | file-4 |
                         ----------  ----------              ----------    ----------
      </screen>

			<para>Through magic, jigdo-file finds out which of the loose files are contained in the ISO image and their offsets within
			the ISO file.  It outputs two files: a ".template" file and a ".jigdo" file.</para>

    </sect2>




    <sect2 id="the.templatefile"><title>The .template File</title>

			<para>Given an input of an ISO image and a set of files which may or may not be in the ISO image, jigdo-file outputs a
			.template file for that ISO image.  Here's what the .template file looks like:</para>

      <screen>
                    --------------------------------------------------------
      .template:    |xxxx| md5-0  |xx| md5-1  |xxx|cccccccc|x| md5-3  |xxxx|
                    --------------------------------------------------------
      </screen>

			<para>jigdo-file found that the files <filename>file-0</filename>, <filename>file-1</filename> and
			<filename>file-3</filename> were contained in the ISO image.  It removed the contents of the these files and replaced them
			with each file's md5 checksum (the <filename>md5-0</filename>, <filename>md5-1</filename>, etc).</para>

			<para>The "<literal remap="bf">x</literal>" data (directory information, zero padding, etc) within the ISO image is
			compressed and written to the .template file.  Finally, any files within the ISO image that weren't supplied as loose
			files (like <filename>file-2</filename>) are also compressed and written to the .template file.  This is shown as
			"<literal remap="bf">c</literal>" data in the .template file visualization.</para>

			<para>Loose files which were supplied to jigdo-file that aren't found in the ISO image (like <filename>file-4</filename>)
			are ignored.</para>
   
		</sect2>




    <sect2 id="the.jigdofile"><title>The .jigdo File</title>

			<para>Given an input of an ISO image and a set of loose files which may or may not be in the ISO image, jigdo-file outputs
			a .jigdo file for that ISO image.  The Debian .jigdo files are gzipped, so you need to use zcat or zless to view them.
			Here's what a .jigdo file looks like when you gunzip it:</para>

      <screen>
      md5-0=http://somemirror.org/file-0
      md5-1=http://somemirror.org/file-1
      md5-2=http://somemirror.org/file-2
      md5-3=http://somemirror.org/file-3
      </screen>

			<para>The .jigdo file simply provides a mapping between the md5sum of a file within the ISO image and the download URL of
			that file.  There are some other things within the .jigdo file, and if you look through it, you'll see the .jigdo file has
			the same format as a ".ini" file.  It should be self explanatory, but if you want the nitty-gritty details, see the jigdo
			documentation.</para>
   
			<para>The format shown above is not quite what you'd see in a typical .jigdo file, but it's very similar.  If you look at
			the [Servers] section at the bottom of the .jigdo file, you'll see exactly what the difference is between what I showed
			above and an actual .jigdo file.</para>

    </sect2>




    <sect2 id="downloadingtheimage"><title>Downloading The Image</title>

			<para>Once you use jigdo-file to generate a .jigdo and .template file for an ISO image, anyone can use jigdo-lite to
			download that image.  jigdo-lite downloads all the files of a Debian ISO using wget, assembles them and forms a copy of
			the original ISO image on the fly.</para>

    </sect2>

</sect1>





<sect1 id="downloadingyourfirstimage"><title>Downloading Your First Image (In 5 Easy Steps)</title>

	<para>We'll assume that you're starting from scratch and don't have any Debian ISOs on hand.  Once you burn your set of
	ISOs, you can use jigdo-lite later to update them.  We'll cover updating your ISOs in the next section.</para>


		<sect2><title>Install Jigdo</title>

			<para>First install the jigdo-file package:</para>

			<screen>
      # apt-get install jigdo-file
			</screen>

			<para>Jigdo is under aggressive development.  Bug fixes and improvements are constant, so if you're using stable or
			testing, download jigdo-file from unstable at <ulink url= "http://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/jigdo-file.html"
			>http://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/jigdo-file.html</ulink>.  As of 19 July 2002 it's at version 0.6.8.   This is
			the version used for the examples of this HOWTO.</para>

			<para>Note to Woody users: The version of jigdo-lite which comes with Woody (rev 0) is not capable of downloading
			Sarge or Sid.  See <xref linkend="needtoupgrade">.

		</sect2>




		<sect2 id="downloadthe.templateand.jigdofiles"><title>Download The .template And .jigdo Files</title>

			<para>For each ISO image you want to download, you'll need two files:</para>

	 		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>The .jigdo file for the disk image you want to download.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>The .template file for the disk image you want to download.</para></listitem>
	 		</itemizedlist>

			<para>Example: Woody has 8 images, so you need to download 8 .jigdo files and 8 .template files.  They can be
			downloaded from <ulink url="http://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/" >http://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/</ulink> and are named
			<filename>woody-i386-1.iso.jigdo</filename>, <filename>woody-i386-1.iso.template</filename>, <filename>...</filename>,
			and <filename>woody-i386-8.iso.template</filename>.</para>

			<para>Alternatively, instead of downloading a .jigdo and .template file for each ISO image, you can give jigdo-lite an URL
			that points to the .jigdo file that you need, like <literal>http://a.mirror/woody-i386-1.jigdo</literal>.  jigdo-lite will
			download the relevent .jigdo and .template files on the fly.  However, if you're a bit nervous about using jigdo-lite for
			the first time, just download the files and I'll walk you through the process.</para>

		</sect2>




		<sect2 id="runjigdo-lite"><title>Run jigdo-lite</title>

			<para>Run jigdo-lite and give it the .jigdo file of the image you want to download.  Using Woody as an example:</para>

			<screen>
      $ jigdo-lite woody-i386-1.iso.jigdo
			</screen>
   
			<para>Alternatively, if you're working with an URL to the .jigdo file rather than a copy of the .jigdo file on your hard
			drive, run jigdo-lite with an argument of the URL:</para>

			<screen>
      $ jigdo-lite http://a.mirror/woody-i386-1.jigdo
			</screen>

			<para>You'll see something like:</para>

      If you already have a previous version of the CD you are
      downloading, jigdo can re-use files on the old CD that are also
      present on the new image, and you do not need to download them
      again. Mount the old CD ROM and enter the path it is mounted under
      (e.g. `/mnt/cdrom'). Alternatively, just press enter if you want
      to start the download of any remaining files.

			<para>If you forget to pass jigdo-lite a .jigdo file, it will prompt you for one (or an URL that points to one).</para>

			<para>If you suspended jigdo-lite with cntrl-z (don't do this; I'll tell you what you'd see) and did an
			<command>ls</command>, you'd find a new file in the directory named <filename>woody-i386-1.iso.jigdo.unpacked</filename>.
			This file is simply a gunzip'ed version of the .jigdo file.</para>

			<para>Right now, jigdo-lite is telling us that if we did have an outdated version of the CD, to give the pathname to the
			CD.  Since we're assuming that you're starting from scratch and have no Debian ISOs yet, we have nothing to scan (we'll
			cover this in <xref linkend="updatingyourimage">).  So just press &lt;ENTER&gt;.</para>

		<sect2 id="specifyamirror"><title>Specify A Mirror</title>

			<para>You'll see:</para>

			<screen>
      -----------------------------------------------------------------
      The jigdo file refers to files stored on Debian mirrors. Please
      choose a Debian mirror as follows: Either enter a complete URL
      pointing to a mirror (in the form
      `ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/'), or enter any regular expression
      for searching through the list of mirrors (try a two-letter
      country code such as `de', or a country name like `United
      States', or a server name like `sunsite'):
      Debian mirror [http://linux.csua.berkeley.edu/debian//]: 
			</screen>

			<para>jigdo-lite is smart enough to use the mirror that you use for your Debian updates by pulling it from
			<filename>/etc/apt/sources.list</filename> (you can see that I use <filename>linux.csua.berkeley.edu</filename> for my
			updates).  If you wanted to use a different mirror, you would specify a different mirror here.  If this is the mirror you
			want to use, press &lt;ENTER&gt;.  Jigdo-lite will then write a <filename>.jigdo-lite</filename> file in your home
			directory.</para>

			<para>Next, if the .jigdo file you're using references a package which needs to be downloaded from a Non-US server
			(software encumbered by US export restrictions), jigdo-lite will prompt you for a Non-US server.  The message displayed
			(and your response) will be very similar to the mirror dialog described in the previous paragraph.  The only difference is
			that you need to specify (or accept the default value for) a Non-US server.   If the ISO image you're about to download
			contains Non-US software, you'll see:

			<screen>
      -----------------------------------------------------------------
      The jigdo file also refers to the Non-US section of the Debian
      archive. Please repeat the mirror selection for Non-US. Do not
      simply copy the URL you entered above; this does not work because
      the path on the servers differs!
      Debian non-US mirror [http://linux.csua.berkeley.edu/debian-non-US//]: 
			</screen>

			<para>and jigdo-lite will write your choice to your <filename>$HOME/.jigdo-lite</filename> file.  However, if the image
			you're about to download doesn't contain Non-US software you won't see this dialog.</para>
			
			<para>Note that you can reset the default mirrors that jigdo uses for your future downloads in
			<filename>$HOME/.jigdo-lite</filename> file with the following lines:</para>

			<para>After the .template file was found (or after it was downloaded), jigdo-lite begins pulling packages onto your hard
			drive.   There will be alot of messages flying across your screen.  If this is confusing to you, see <xref
			linkend="wgetoptions">.  While jigdo-lite is downloading the packages, switch to another console (or open another xterm)
			and do an <command>ls</command> in the directory you're running jigdo-lite in.  Now there should be 6 files in the
			directory:</para>

			<para><filename>woody-i386-1.iso.tmp</filename> won't appear right away.  It's a temporary version of the ISO file that

			<para><filename>jigdo-file-cache.db</filename> is a Berekeley DB file containing md5sums of any files read in when you

			<para><filename role="direcotry">tmp/</filename> is a directory containing Debian package files that get downloaded.  For

<sect1 id="updatingyourimage"><title>Updating Your Image</title>

	<para>Presumably, you've read the last section, followed the instructions, burned your newly created ISO files onto CD and are
	feeling warm and fuzzy.  Sooner or later, some packages will get updated and now you want to donate your old CDs to some
	newbie at your local LUG's installfest and burn yourself a set of updated CDs.  Since you're well on the way to becoming a
	jigdo-guru, we won't go into as much painful detail as we did in the last section.</para>

	<para>The first step is to download the .jigdo and .template files, again, for the images you want to update.  You may wonder
	why you need to download them a second time.  The reason is because the updated image you want to download has changed.  Files
	may have been added or deleted, but even if not, any updated packages or files will have a different checksum from the
	checksum listed in the .jigdo and .template files you used when you first downloaded the images.</para>

	<para>At this point, you're either holding an outdated Debian CD in your hand or you have the CD's outdated ISO image on your
	hard drive.  Let's go through the steps of getting an updated ISO file.  If you have a CD, put it in your CD drive and mount
	it:</para>

	<screen>
      $ mount /cdrom
	</screen>

	<para>On the other hand, if you have an ISO file you'd like to update, mount it as a loop device (you may need to be root
	to do this).  I'll be updating my Woody image, since I noticed that Woody just got a few security updates:</para>

	<screen>
      # mount -o loop woody-i386-1.iso /mnt
	</screen>

	<para>Now run jigdo-lite with the .jigdo file as an argument.</para>

      If you already have a previous version of the CD you are
      downloading, jigdo can re-use files on the old CD that are also
      present on the new image, and you do not need to download them
      again. Mount the old CD ROM and enter the path it is mounted under
      (e.g. `/mnt/cdrom'). Alternatively, just press enter if you want
      to start the download of any remaining files.

	<para>jigdo-lite is asking us to give it the location of your mounted CD (if you're updating a CD) or your loop mounted ISO
	file (if you're using the ISO file).  I'm using an ISO file loop mounted on <filename role="directory">/mnt</filename>, so
	I'll enter <literal>/mnt</literal>.  If you're updating a CD, enter the mount directory of your CD, which is most likely
	<literal>/cdrom</literal>.  In either case, jigdo-lite will scan the directory of your mounted media, determine which files
	need updating and re-use the files which don't need updating.  You may see something like:</para>

      it or use --force
      jigdo-file failed with code 3 - aborting.
	</screen>


	<para>What happened?  Actually, I wanted to show you this because you'll bump into it sooner or later.  I'm updating an ISO
	file, but the outdated image file is in the same directory I'm working in.  Jigdo-lite wants to generate a file called
	<filename>woody-i386-1.iso</filename> but there's already a file by that name in the current directory (the outdated image).
	Jigdo-lite doesn't want to destroy that file, so it bails and lets me know that I can either delete that file or use
	<literal>--force</literal> to overwrite the file.   You could also rename or move the file too, but I guess jigdo-lite
	assumes we already know this. &nbsp;  :-)</para>
	
	<para>Don't be timid about moving or renaming the image file just because it's loop mounted.  The filesystem uses inodes under
	the hood, and even if you move or rename the file, the inode stays the same.  You won't hurt the filesystem mounted under
	<filename role="directory">/mnt</filename>.  As for deleting the ISO file, that won't hurt the mounted filesystem either.  A
	file's inode gets deallocated only when the inode's reference count drops to zero.  Mounting the ISO image bumps the reference
	count up, so the file really gets deleted only after you <command>rm</command> the file <emphasis>and</emphasis> umount the
	loop device.  All you people who are updating the CD don't have to worry about any of this.  :-)</para>

	<para>I'll rename the ISO file to <filename>woody-i386-1.iso.old</filename> and run jigdo-lite again.  Let's try again:</para>

	temporary situation.  If you see one of these questions and know that the temporary situation has changed, please <ulink
	url="mailto:p@dirac.org">contact me</ulink> and let me know so I can remove the question from the mini-HOWTO.</para>


		<sect2><title>[11 Aug 2002]: I see the Woody and Sid .jigdo files.  Where are the Sarge .jigdo files?</title>

			<para>The testing ISO images aren't being offered at the moment because the boot floppies are broken.  When they get
			fixed, .jigdo files for weekly snapshots of Sarge will be available from a semi-official source (probably
			<ulink url="http://non-us.cdimage.debian.org">http://non-us.cdimage.debian.org</ulink>).

		</sect2>




		<sect2><title>[11 Aug 2002]: Can I have two jigdo-lite sessions at the same time in the same directory?</title>

			<para>Not at the moment.  The two sessions will clash over the <filename>tmp/</filename> and
			<filename>jigdo-file-cache.db</filename> files.  This will being worked on.  If you want to run concurrent jigdo-lite
			sessions, use different working directories.</para>

		</sect2>




		<sect2 id="disacknowledgements"><title>[11 Aug 2002]: Why aren't the translations of this HOWTO on LDP?</title>

			<para>I've been having trouble getting the translations of this HOWTO submitted to the non-English LDP editors.</para>

			<para>The German LDP editor, Marco Budde <email>Budde@tu-harburg.de</email> refuses to accept the German translation
			because it was written in Docbook and not Linuxdoc, even though Docbook is the preferred SGML language for the LDP.</para>
			
			<para>The Portuguese LDP editor, Alfredo Carvalho <email>ajpc@poli.org</email>, has completely ignored my submission of
			the Portuguese translation.</para>
			
			<para>If you care about having LDP documents in these languages, I urge you to write to these editors and ask them to
			please be more responsible about accepting translated documents.  For the time being, you can download these translations
			from my personal website, <ulink url="http://www.dirac.org/linux/debian/jigdo"
			>http://www.dirac.org/linux/debian/jigdo</ulink>.</para>

		</sect2>




		<sect2><title>How can I make jigdo use a proxy?</title>

			<para>This is described on <ulink url="http://debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/">http://debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/</ulink> as well as
			the <filename>README</filename> of the jigdo-lite tarball.</para>

		</sect2>




		<sect2 id="interrupted"><title>What do I do if my jigdo download gets interrupted?</title>

			<para>If your download gets interrupted, all you need to do is restart jigdo-lite and hit &lt;ENTER&gt; at all the
			question prompts.  Jigdo-lite will pick up where it left off.</para>

		</sect2>




		<sect2><title>My jigdo download won't complete because the .jigdo file is broken.  When I download a new, fixed .jigdo file,
		do I need to download all the data over again?</title>

			<para>You may find that the .jigdo file you downloaded is broken.  It's very uncommon, but it does happen from time to
			time with moving targets like Debian testing or unstable.</para>
			
			<para>If you find that your .jigdo file is broken, you'll need to download a new .jigdo file (when a fixed one becomes
			available), but you <emphasis>won't</emphasis> need to download all the ISO data again.</para>

			<para>You can use the same loop mounting trick we use when updating an ISO image.  The difference is that there's no
			finished .iso file to start with, but the .iso.tmp file is an ISO image too and can be used to finish the download without
			having to re-download all the data that was downloaded before the broken .jigdo file caused jigdo-file to halt.  Simply
			loop mount the .tmp.iso file on <filename role="directory">/mnt</filename> and when you re-run jigdo-lite with the fixed
			.jigdo file, tell jigdo-lite to scan <filename role="directory">/mnt</filename>.  Don't forget to rename or move the
			.tmp.iso file so it doesn't interfere with jigdo-lite which will want to create a new .tmp.iso file.</para>

		</sect2>




		<sect2><title>Can I use jigdo to download images for DVD?</title>

			<para>Absolutely; the process is identical to downloading CD images.  The only thing you need to do differently is to
			download the .jigdo and .template files for DVDs instead of CDs.  You can find the DVD .jigdo and .template files at
			<ulink url="http://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/">http://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/</ulink>.</para>

			<para>Note that you need Linux 2.4 or later to create DVD-sized files.  Under Windows, DVD-sized images can't be created
			at all at the moment because the C++ library of the mingw gcc port doesn't have big file support yet.</para>

		</sect2>




		<sect2><title>Can I burn the <filename>.iso.tmp</filename> file to CD?</title>

			<para>We haven't tried yet, but it should be possible.  You'd probably find some files are filled with "0"'s.  If someone
			tries it, please contact me at <email><ulink url="mailto:p@dirac.org">p@dirac.org</ulink></email> and let me know what
			happened.</para>

			<para>But more importantly, why would you WANT to do this? &nbsp; :-)</para>

		</sect2>




		<sect2><title>Why doesn't jigdo work?  It downloads some packages and deletes them.  I know it doesn't write them to the
		<filename>iso.tmp</filename> file because the file size doesn't change!</title>

			<para>Jigdo works just fine - the .iso.tmp file is created at the beginning with its final size, but filled with zero
			bytes.  Later, parts of it are overwritten with the downloaded data.</para>

			<para>You can tell that jigdo is making progress by looking at the messages "<literal>Found X of the Y files required by
			the template</literal>" that are printed from time to time.  The second value "<literal>Y</literal>" should decrease.
			When it reaches zero, the download is finished.</para>

		<sect2 id="needtoupgrade"><title>I'm having trouble getting jigdo to download Sarge or Sid.</title>

			<para>If you're using Potato or Woody, upgrade to jigdo-lite 0.6.8.  Because of a change in Jigdo, the version of
			jigdo-lite that comes with Woody (rev 0) cannot download Sarge and Sid images.  The version that comes with Sarge is
			sufficient (<xref linkend="links">).

			<para>If you're using Sarge or Sid, then you may need some help.  Search the archives of the debian-cd mailing list, and
			if that doesn't solve your problem, you should send them a request for help (<xref linkend="links">).</para>

		</sect2>




		<sect2 id="wgetoptions"><title>Jigdo-lite is too verbose.  How can I supress some or all of its messages?</title>

			<para>Jigdo-lite uses wget, and wget's output can be quite verbose.  If this is unsettling, you can make wget more quiet
			by adding <literal>--non-verbose</literal> to the <literal>wgetOpts</literal> switch in your
			<filename>~/.jigdo-lite</filename> file.  If you want wget to print no messages at all, use <literal>--quiet</literal> in
			the <literal>wgetOpts</literal> switch.</para>

		</sect2>




		<sect2 id="otherplatforms"><title>Can I use jigdo on platforms other than Linux?</title>

			<para>Certainly.  If you're interested in Potato or Woody under Microsoft Windows, old SunOS, HP-UX and IRIX you can use
			jigdo-easy.  See <xref linkend="jigdo-easy"> and <xref linkend="links">.</para>

			<para>If you want to download Potato, Woody, Sarge or Sid under Microsoft Windows, jigdo-lite has been ported to that
			platform and can be downloaded from the main jigdo site (<xref linkend="links">).</para>

</sect1>





<sect1 id="errata"><title>Errata</title>

		<sect2 id="jigdo-easy"><title>jigdo-easy</title>

			<para>Jigdo-easy, by Anne Bezemer, is a fork from jigdo-lite which is portable to a wider range of systems, including
			Microsoft Windows, old SunOS, HP-UX and IRIX).  It's also easier to use than jigdo-lite but because of changes made to
			Jigdo, will only work with Potato and Woody.  Jigdo-easy will not be able to download Sarge and Sid.  See <xref

		<sect2><title>GUI Interface</title>

			<para>A GTK+ interface to jigdo is currently being worked on.  It's not fully functional yet, but will be available at
			some point.  There will be a Linux as well as a Windows GUI client.</para>

		</sect2>




		<sect2 id="jigdo-file-cache"><title>jigdo-file-cache.db</title>

			<para>The cache contains the md5sums of files read when you supply a directory at the <literal>Files to scan:</literal>
			prompt.  If you have jigdo-file scan the same directory a second time, the scan will be very fast.</para>

			<para>This could be useful in the following case: rev0 gets updated to rev1.  With the rev1 CD images, some packages may
			have been pushed from CD <literal>n</literal> to CD <literal>n+1</literal>, or vice versa.  If you had a particularly slow
			link (e.g.  modem), you'd try to avoid downloading these packages again.  For this reason, when downloading the new
			version of CD <literal>n</literal>, you'd let jigdo-lite scan the three CDs <literal>n-1</literal>, <literal>n</literal>
			and <literal>n+1</literal> (or even all 8 CDs if you want to be 100% sure).</para>

			<para>If you have jigdo-lite scan the same CDs over and over again while updating each of the 8 CD images, the cache will
			prevent all the data on the CDs from being read multiple times.</para>

			<para>The cache is much more important when <emphasis>generating</emphasis> jigdo files, because you don't want jigdo-file
			to read in your whole 50GB Debian mirror for every generated jigdo file.</para>
