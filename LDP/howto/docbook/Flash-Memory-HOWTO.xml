  <abstract>

    <para>
     This document describes procedures for installing USB Flash
     Memory devices and the way of formatting them for various file
     systems such as vfat (the way they usually come) and ext2 (the
     way they fit in better with Linux). It is also described how to
     partition the device in two sections with different file types.

   <title> Purpose</title>


   <para>
    The purpose of this document is to describe procedures for
    implementing USB flash memory devices (memory sticks) on
    Linux. This entails the following:
   </para>
   
   <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>
         <para>
         making over-the-counter devices, pre-formatted for the MS
         Windows system, work on Linux;
         </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
         <para>
         formatting the device in the ext2 filesystem on a single
         partition and making it work. This is intended for situations
         where the device will be used exclusively on Linux machines;
         </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
         <para>
         formatting the device on a dual partition in the ext2 and
         vfat filesystems and making it work. The purpose of this
         is for situations where Linux + Linux and Linux + Windows are
         possible;
         </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
         <para>
         making the device more user friendly;
         </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
         <para>
         maintaining the filesystem of the device;
         </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
         <para>
         using additional features of Linux-2.6.x.
         </para>
       </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>


   <para>
    The procedures described in this document should work on
    any USB memory stick device which can be operated as a read-write
    device. Read-only devices do not fall in this category. The
    procedures will not work if the write facility of the device is
    disabled (i.e. if the write protect switch is on).
   </para>

   <para>
    The procedures described for formatting and maintenance in
    particular filesystems may (in principle) be adapted for other
    filesystems such as ext3 and reiserfs. These have not been tried
    and tested. Neither has any attention been paid to adaptation of
    the procedures to other related operating systems.
   </para>


   <warning><para>
    It may be dangerous to re-format the flash memory
    intended for a digital camera. The camera may then be unable to
    understand it. Use the camera's built-in menu system to do this
	 reformatting for you.

<sect1 id="physical">
   <title>Physical devices</title>

   <para>
    Flash memory devices come mainly in the form of small, portable
    devices often referred to as <emphasis>memory sticks</emphasis> or
    <emphasis>keychains</emphasis>, and as part of digital
    cameras. They are <emphasis>non-volatile devices</emphasis> which
    operate on the principle that electric charges are used to
    represent data in binary format. These charges can remain
    unchanged almost indefinitely, but changes (such as writing to the
    device) limit the life span of the device (100000 writes of 8MB
    each).
   </para>
   
   <para> 
    Memory sticks plug directly into a USB-port at the back of your
    computer. The power it needs is supplied by the USB-port. It is
    sometimes convenient to use a USB-extension cable to bring the
    device within easy reach. 
   </para>
   
   <para>
    Memory sticks usually have <emphasis>write protect
    switches</emphasis> which should be turned off if you want to use
    it as read-write device. If the switch is in the <quote>on</quote> position,
    the device is <emphasis>read-only</emphasis>. The devices are
    usually equipped with a led (light emitting diode), which
    indicates that the device is operational. The led also flickers
    while data is being transferred to or from the device.
   </para>

   <para>
    Digital cameras use flash memory for image storage. These are 
    powered by the camera and connected to the computer's USB-port via
    an electronic interface. To be able to connect to the computer,
    the camera's power must be turned on for the duration of the
    interfacing, and should only be turned off after the device had
    been unmounted from the computer. It is important to remember that
    the device takes power from the camera's battery. The operation
    should therefore be terminated as soon as possible.
   </para>

   <title> Buying a memory stick</title>	
	
	<para>
    Important considerations when buying a memory stick are the
    following:
   </para>
	
	<variablelist>
	
	<varlistentry>
	<term><emphasis role="strong">The size of the memory</emphasis></term>
	<listitem>
	<para>
		This will depend on whatever use you have in mind. 128MB seems to be

	<varlistentry>
	<term><emphasis role="strong">Is it known to work on Linux?</emphasis></term>
	<listitem>
	<para>
    The established brands have web sites in which this may be stated
    explicitly. Alternatively, ask the supplier. But beware: the sales
    person may not know what you are talking about. The instruction
    leaflet may also mention something like: Works on Linux-2.4, or
    may have a picture of the Linux penguin. If these inquiries fail, it
    may be wise not to buy.  
	</para>
	</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	<term><emphasis role="strong">Extension cable and keychain</emphasis></term>
	<listitem>
	<para>
    Memory sticks usually are packaged with an extension cable 
    (<xref linkend="physical" />) and a keychain. The latter provides
    a safe and with-it way of transporting the device. Make sure that
    these are included. You may need an additional extension cable,
    depending on circumstances. Laptop and notebook computers usually
    don't need them.
	</para>
	</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	<term><emphasis role="strong">File system</emphasis></term>
	<listitem>
	<para>
    Over-the-counter memory sticks are usually formatted in vfat
    (msdos), and this will work in Linux, but you will not have the
    strength and versatility of the standard ext2 (or other) file
    system. This is not a problem. It can be endowed with other file
    systems as will be described later in this document.
	</para>
	</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	<term><emphasis role="strong">Cost</emphasis></term>
	<listitem>
	<para>
    Prices of memory sticks of a given size may vary considerably. It
    is a good idea to find out what that range is. The internet is
    excellent for the purpose.

    In this section we discuss in a very brief manner, some basic

  <sect2 id="proc">
    <title>The /proc filesystem</title>

    <para>
      The /proc filesystem serves as a window through which we can see
      the workings of a Linux setup. The objects of most interest for
      this document are the directories<filename
      class="directory">/proc/bus/usb/</filename> and <filename
      class="directory">/proc/scsi/</filename>. These will be used to
      verify that the kernel had been set up properly for our purpose
      (<xref linkend="proc-probe" />). 

    </para>
  </sect2>

 <sect2 id="scsidev">
 <title> SCSI devices</title>

   <para>
    Your memory stick will be considered as a USB mass storage device
    posing as a removable SCSI disk (sd).  SCSI disk devices are
    mapped to the <filename class="directory"> /dev</filename>
    (devices) directory under <filename class="directory">
    /dev/sda</filename> , <filename class="directory">
    /dev/sdb</filename> , ... When different disk devices are present,
    they will be mapped to <filename>/dev/sda</filename>,
    <filename>/dev/sdb</filename>, etc.  If, for example, a memory
    stick and a digital camera are plugged in, the one would be mapped
    to <filename>/dev/sda</filename> and the other to
    <filename>/dev/sdb</filename>. Tests have indicated that the first
    device to be detected is mapped to <filename>sda</filename> and
    represented in the directory <filename
    class="directory">/proc/scsi/usb-storage-0</filename>. The second
    will be mapped to <filename>sdb</filename> and represented in
    <filename class="directory">/proc/scsi/usb-storage-0</filename>.
    What will happen when both devices are present at boot-up, is not
    known. An overview of the partitions relevant to this document,
    the file <filename>/proc/partitions</filename> may be consulted.
    Look for entries like <filename>sda, sda1, sdb</filename>. Under
    the Linux-2.6 series of kernels this problem may be very neatly
    resolved (<xref linkend="linux-2.6"/>).


    </para>
    
   <para>
    In the descriptions further on, it will be assumed that only one
    memory stick is present, and therefore mapped to 
    <filename>/dev/sda</filename>.
   </para>

   <para>
    In most distributions these points exist in abundance. You should
    check that this is the case in your setup
	 (<userinput><command>ls</command> /dev/sda*</userinput>. If there are none you can create them by
    doing (as root, indicated by the hash).
   </para>

   <screen>
             <prompt>#</prompt> <userinput><command>mknod</command> /dev/sda  b 8 0</userinput>

   </screen>
        
   <para>
    etc, up to <filename>/dev/sda15</filename> if necessary. The
    device as a whole is mapped to <filename>/dev/sda</filename>,
    while <filename>/dev/sdax (x = 1 ... 15)</filename> represent
    the various partitions of the device. We shall describe, later on,
    how to create different partitions for different file systems (see
    <xref linkend="ext2" /> and <xref linkend="mixed" /> ). If you
    intend to use your memory stick with a single partition
    (filesystem), <filename>/dev/sda1</filename> is sufficient.

  <sect2 id="usbfs">
  <title> The USB device filesystem</title>
    <para>
     This dynamically generated filesystem should be mounted at
     <filename class="directory">/proc/bus/usb/</filename>. It is
     therefore essential that this mount point exists. Once it is
     mounted, there should be more to be seen in <filename
     class="directory">/proc/bus/usb/</filename> and in <filename
     class="directory">/proc/scsi/</filename> (<xref
     linkend="mounting" />). To find out which USB devices are
     present, read the file <filename>/proc/bus/usb/devices</filename>
     (<command> less /proc/bus/usb/devices</command>). It takes a
     small effort to interpret the writing on the screen, but it is
     not difficult. A memory stick is indicated by <emphasis>Mass

  <sect2 id="ext2fs">
  <title>The ext2 filesystem</title>
    <para>
     The ext2 (second extended) filesystem still is the most prevalent
     in Linux setups. It is most versatile and sophisticated, carrying

     what), ownership (user, group, others), a timestamp (when last
     modified), etc. Moreover, tools for the proper maintenance of a
     device endowed with ext2, exist (<xref linkend="maintain"/>).  If
     a flash memory device is to be used exclusively within Linux
     setups, it is therefore desirable to format it in ext2 (see <xref

  <title>The vfat filesystem</title>
    <para>
     Enabling vfat in the kernel makes it possible to mount
     filesystems created under Dos/Windows to be mounted in a Linux
     system. Most memory sticks are formatted for direct use on
     Windows and should therefore be considered as vfat-formatted. The
     vfat filesystem is less sophisticated than ext2 and will
     therefore be more economic as far as memory space is
     concerned. It does not carry permissions in the same way as ext2
     with the result that an ext2-file saved in vfat will re-appear
     with its permissions changed. Nonetheless, if a memory stick is
     to be used for the purpose of carrying data between Linux and
     Windows machines, it is best to keep it in the vfat format. A
     compromise is to partition the memory stick in two parts: one in
     vfat and the other in ext2. At least the Linux machine should be
     able to handle both. This is described in <xref linkend="mixed"/>

    your kernel supports the USB-subsystem correctly. If this is not

    It is assumed that the flash memory is mapped to <filename>
    /dev/sda</filename>. In this section we treat the situation where
    the whole flash memory device will become devoted to a single ext2
    partition. In the example procedure shown below, a 128MB flash
    memory was formatted for ext2. That is why figures like 131MB and
    888 cylinders appear. The fdisk tool, which is used, simply reads
    that from the device.

    created on <filename> /dev/sda</filename>
    (please note: not <filename>

    shattered. The procedure will be given in somewhat less detailed

    of the previous section is repeated and that the hex code for 
    each file type is explicitly entered (lines following the entry 
    "t": Win95 = b; Linux = 83). When the partition will only be for
    Linux, this is unnecessary -- Linux is the default. Also note that
    the vfat partition goes on first -- that is the way Windows would

<title> Making the memory stick accessible to users</title>

   <para> 
    What we have described so far, are simply the procedures of setting
    up the system and formatting memory sticks. We have to make the
    mounting of the USB filesystem more permanent, and we have to make
    mounting of such a device easier for non-root users. There are
    only a few things to be done.
   </para>

   <para>
    The procedure described below is for the more complex situation of
    a memory stick with a dual partition (<xref linkend="mixed"/>). If 
    the partition is a single ext2, the procedure should be simplified
    by leaving out the line referring to the vfat part and changing 
    <filename>sda2</filename> to <filename>sda1</filename>.
   </para>

   <para> 
    Suppose that the mount points <filename> /mnt/memstick</filename>
    and <filename> /mnt/fatstick</filename> have been created. You do
    not have to use those words and they don't even have to be
    sub-directories of <filename> /mnt</filename>
   </para>

   <para> 
    To make remembering easier, create the following symbolic links:
   </para>

   <screen>
 
             <prompt>#</prompt> <userinput><command>ln</command> -s /dev/sda1 /dev/fatflash</userinput>
             <prompt>#</prompt> <userinput><command>ln</command> -s /dev/sda2 /dev/flash</userinput> 
   </screen>

   <para> 
    For smoother and easier mounting add the following lines to
   <filename> /etc/fstab</filename> : (<emphasis> See NOTE at the end of
   </emphasis> <xref linkend="mounting" /> )</para>

    <screen>
             none          /proc/bus/usb usbfs       defaults       0 0 
             /dev/flash    /mnt/memstick ext2,vfat   rw,user,noauto 0 0 
             /dev/fatflash /mnt/fatstick vfat        rw,user,noauto 0 0 
   </screen>

   <para> 
    The middle line enables mounting either in ext2 or vfat.
    The last two lines make it possible for any user to mount the
    device by the command
   </para>

   <screen>
             <prompt>$</prompt><userinput><command> mount</command> /dev/flash</userinput>  [for ext2 or vfat] 
             <prompt>$</prompt><userinput><command> mount</command> /dev/fatflash</userinput>  [for vfat] 
   </screen>

   <para> 
     It is possible to mount both partitions simultaneously. See <xref linkend="mixed" />.
   </para>

   <para> 
    In the case of an ext2-formatted device it does not seem possible
    for a user (other than root) to mount in read-write mode. The
    solution is to create a directory on the memory stick owned by the
    particular user with complete permissions. Root should do that:
   </para>

   <screen>
             <prompt>#</prompt> <userinput><command>mount </command>/dev/flash </userinput>
             <prompt># </prompt><userinput><command>mkdir</command> -m 777 /mnt/memstick/superdir </userinput>
             <prompt># </prompt><userinput><command>chown</command> charles:charles /mnt/memstick/superdir </userinput>
   </screen>
 
   <para>
    If the device is in the vfat format, this step is unnecessary.

           <para>
             The <emphasis>sysfs</emphasis> filesystem is intrinsic to
             the Linux-2.6 kernel series. It is used by
             <emphasis>udev</emphasis> and
             <emphasis>sysfstools</emphasis> to obtain information
             about kernel objects (devices, etc.), their attributes
             and mutual linkages. Activation is according to the
             following procedure:
            </para>
              
            <screen>
              <prompt># </prompt><userinput><command>cd</command></userinput> /
              <prompt># </prompt><userinput><command>mkdir</command></userinput> sys
              <prompt># </prompt><userinput><command>mount</command></userinput> -t sysfs none /sys
            </screen>

            <para> 

             If you do <userinput><command> ls </command>  -F
             /sys</userinput>, a whole directory structure
             with entries like <emphasis>block/</emphasis>,
             <emphasis>bus/</emphasis>, ... will be shown. You were
             successful. The mounting should now be made permanent by
             adding the following line to
             <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>:
            </para>

             This is installed in one of the usual ways without having
             to make special configuration options. Instructions in
             the README file are very clear. You should, however,
             first make sure that the entry
             <filename>/usr/local/lib</filename> is entered in
             <filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename> so that the
             <filename>libsysfs.so</filename> libraries will be
             recognisable by the system. After installation, check
             that the utilities <filename>/usr/local/bin/lsbus</filename>
             and <filename>/usr/local/bin/systool</filename> have been
             installed. Also check that the libraries mentioned above
             have been properly linked in
             (<userinput><command>ldconfig </command>-p | grep
             libsysfs</userinput>).

         </formalpara>

           <para>
             Next install the <filename>hotplug</filename>
             scripts. The first thing to do is to check that
             hotplugging will work on your system. Do:
             <userinput><command> less </command>
             /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug</userinput>. The
             result should be
             <computeroutput>/sbin/hotplug</computeroutput>. If it is
             not so, you should add the line <filename> echo
             "/sbin/hotplug" > /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug</filename> to
             an appropriate initialization script,
             e.g. <filename>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</filename>. This
             command could also be given (as root) before checking
             that everything works. Installation is extremely
             simple. Do: <prompt># </prompt><userinput><command> make
             </command> install</userinput>. Check afterwards that the
             script <filename>/sbin/hotplug</filename> exists.
            </para>

          <title>Udev.</title>

         </formalpara>
           
           <para>
             This is the last installation. Study the README file and
             follow the instructions necessary to be able to run
             <userinput><command>make </command>
             USE_KLIBC=true</userinput>. If you have
             compiled the Linux-2.6.x kernel, this should not be too
             difficult. A quick check would be to find out if
             <filename>/sbin/udev</filename> and
             <filename>/sbin/udevinfo</filename> exist. There are
             other occurences as well, a very important one being
             <filename>/etc/udev/udev.rules</filename>. If you have a
             working setup for memory sticks (as described above) and
             a memory stick plugged in you could try
             <userinput><command>ls </command>/udev</userinput>, you
             should see the device (sda, sda1, ...). If it is there,
             unplug the device and list again. It should be gone!
           </para>
           
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="names">
      <title>Naming memory sticks</title>
           <para>
             With the <emphasis>udev</emphasis> utility in place, it
             is possible to identify a memory stick on the basis of
             some built-in attribute. One that works, is the
             <emphasis>vendor</emphasis> identity. To find this for an
             attached device, do <userinput><command>systool
             </command> -vb scsi | grep vendor</userinput>. This
             should give a list of attached SCSI devices (remember
             that your memory stick poses as a SCSI device <xref
             linkend="scsidev"/>). Let us suppose that you have two
             memory sticks plugged in at the same time and found (as I
             did) two vendor Id's, namely "UFD" and "STORAGE". Then
             add to the file <filename>/etc/udev/udev.rules</filename>
             the following lines (at the top if you like):
           </para>

           <screen>
              ## Flash Memory 1
              BUS="scsi", SYSFS_vendor="UFD*", NAME="namib%n"

              ## Flash Memory 2
              BUS="scsi", SYSFS_vendor="STORAGE*", NAME="kalahari%n"
           </screen>

           <para>
             The vendor-identities may have trailing blank spaces, and
             therefore the wildcard asterisks have a purpose. Do not
             ignore them.  Remove and replace the memory sticks, then
             do <userinput><command>ls </command>
             /udev</userinput>. Instead of the impersonal
             <filename>sda</filename>, <filename>sda1</filename>,
             etc. there should now be <filename>kalahari</filename>,
             <filename>kalahari1</filename>,
             <filename>namib</filename> and
             <filename>namib1</filename>. The devices have been named
             according to the "vendor" information in them. Thus we
             can identify the device, no matter where it was
             mapped. All that remains to be done is to creat
             appropriate mount points like
             <filename>/mnt/namib</filename> and
             <filename>kalahari</filename> and make entries like
           </para>
            <screen>
             /udev/namib1     /mnt/namib     vfat,ext2  user,noauto,rw  0 0 
             /udev/kalahari1  /mnt/kalahari  vfat,ext2  user,noauto,rw  0 0         
            </screen>
           <para>
             in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> to enable mounting
             from other places.
           </para>
           <para>
             This is great fun ... and remember, there are other
             deserts on the planet.
