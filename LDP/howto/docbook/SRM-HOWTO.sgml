<Abstract>

<Para>
This document describes how to boot Linux/Alpha using the SRM console,
which is the console firmware also used to boot Compaq Tru64 Unix
(also known as Digital Unix and OSF/1) and OpenVMS.
</Para>

<Sect1>
<Title>About this manual</Title>

<Sect2>
<Title>Who should read this manual</Title>

<Para>
You should read this manual if you are installing Linux on a new
Alpha system that can only boot from the SRM console, or if you are
installing Linux on an older Alpha system that can use the SRM console
and wish to use SRM to boot your Linux installation.
</Para>

<Para>
Because SRM is the only way to boot Linux on modern Alpha systems,
and because it provides the proper operating environment for Unix and
Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux), it is the recommended way
of booting Linux on Alpha when available.
</Para>

<Para>
Sometimes, it is preferable to use the ARC, ARCSBIOS, or AlphaBIOS
console, such as if you have a machine for which SRM is not available,
if you wish to dual-boot with Windows NT without switching consoles,
or if you have hardware that is not supported by SRM.  On these
machines, you will typically use MILO to boot Linux.  For more
information, refer to the MILO Howto, available from
<ULink
URL="http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/milo.html"
>http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/milo.html</ULink

<Title>Conventions</Title>

<Para>
Throughout this manual, we will use the following conventions for
commands to be entered by the user:
</Para>

<Para>
SRM console commands will be shown with the characteristic SRM
'&#62;&#62;&#62;' prompt, like this: 
<FOOTNOTE>

<Para>
On multiprocessor machines, you
will see 'P00&#62&#62;' instead, or possibly some other number depending on
which processor SRM is running. 
</Para>

</FOOTNOTE>


<Screen>
&#62;&#62;&#62; boot dva0 -fi linux.gz -fl "root=/dev/fd0 load_ramdisk=1"
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
Unix commands will be shown with the '&num;' command prompt if they are
to be run as <Literal remap="tt">root</Literal>, or '$' if they are to be run by a normal user,
like this:

<Screen>
# swriteboot -f3 /dev/sda /boot/bootlx
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
Aboot commands will be shown with the 'aboot&#62;' command prompt, like
this:

<Screen>
aboot&#62; b 6/boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/hda6
</Screen>

</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect1>
<Title>What is SRM?</Title>

<Para>
SRM console is used by Alpha systems as
Unix-style boot firmware. Tru64 Unix and OpenVMS depend on it and
Linux can boot from it. You can recognize SRM console as a blue screen
with a prompt that is presented to you on power-up.
</Para>

<Sect2>
<Title>Getting to SRM</Title>

<Para>
Most Alpha systems have both the SRM and ARC/AlphaBIOS console in
their firmware.  On one of these machines, if your machine starts up
with ARC/AlphaBIOS by default, you can switch to SRM through the
"Console Selection" option in the Advanced CMOS Setup menu.  To make
the change permanent, you should set the <Literal remap="tt">os&lowbar;type</Literal> environment
variable in SRM to "OpenVMS" or "Unix", like this:

<Screen>
&#62;&#62;&#62; set os_type Unix
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
Either one will work to boot Linux.  However, if you intend to
dual-boot OpenVMS on this machine, you must set <Literal remap="tt">os&lowbar;type</Literal> to
"OpenVMS".  Conversely, to return to ARC/AlphaBIOS, you can set
<Literal remap="tt">os&lowbar;type</Literal> to "NT".
</Para>

<Para>
Some older systems may not have both SRM and ARC in firmware as
shipped.  On these systems, you will have to upgrade your firmware.
See <ULink
URL="http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/"
>http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware</ULink
> for the
latest firmware updates and instructions.
</Para>

<Para>
A few older systems (primarily evaluation boards such as the 164SX
and 164LX) are "half-flash" systems, whose firmware can hold SRM or
AlphaBIOS, but not both.  If you have one of these machines, you will
have to reflash your firmware with the SRM console using the AlphaBIOS
firmware update utility.  Again, see
<ULink
URL="http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/"
>http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware</ULink
> for firmware
images and instructions.  If you wish to return to AlphaBIOS on these
machines, you may rerun the firmware update utility from a floppy in
SRM using the <Literal remap="tt">fwupdate</Literal> command.  You can also start AlphaBIOS
from a floppy using the <Literal remap="tt">arc</Literal> command.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Using the SRM console</Title>

<Para>
The SRM console works very much like a Unix or OpenVMS shell.  It
views your NVRAM and devices as a pseudo-filesystem.  You can see this
if you use the <Literal remap="tt">ls</Literal> command.  Also, it contains a fairly large set
of diagnostic, setup, and debugging utilities, the details of which
are beyond the scope of this document.  As in the Unix shell, you can
pipe the output of one command to the input of another, and there is a
<Literal remap="tt">more</Literal> command that works not unlike the Unix one.  To get a full
listing of available commands, run:

<Screen>
&#62;&#62;&#62; help | more
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
As well, SRM has environment variables, a number of which are
pre-defined and correspond to locations in NVRAM.  You can view the
entire list of environment variables and their values with the
<Literal remap="tt">show</Literal> command (there are quite a few of them, so you will probably
want to pipe its output to <Literal remap="tt">more</Literal>).  You can also show variables
matching a "glob" pattern - for example, <Literal remap="tt">show boot*</Literal> will show all
the variables starting in "boot".
</Para>

<Para>
Environment variables are categorized as either <Emphasis>read-only</Emphasis>,
<Emphasis>warm non-volatile</Emphasis>, or <Emphasis>cold non-volatile</Emphasis>.  The full listing
of pre-defined variables is detailed in the Alpha Architecture
Reference Manual.  The most useful pre-defined environment variables
for the purposes of booting Linux are <Literal remap="tt">bootdef&lowbar;dev</Literal>,
<Literal remap="tt">boot&lowbar;file</Literal>, <Literal remap="tt">boot&lowbar;flags</Literal>, and
<Literal remap="tt">auto&lowbar;action</Literal>, all of which are cold non-volatile.
</Para>

<Para>
To set environment variables, use the <Literal remap="tt">set</Literal> command, like this:

<Screen>
&#62;&#62;&#62; set bootdef_def dka0
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
If you set an undefined variable, it will be created for you, however
it will not persist across reboots.
</Para>

<Para>
The <Literal remap="tt">bootdef&lowbar;dev</Literal> variable specifies the device (using
VMS naming conventions - see <XRef LinkEnd="device-naming"> for an
explanation of these) which will be booted from if no device is
specified on the <Literal remap="tt">boot</Literal> command line, or in an automatic boot.
The <Literal remap="tt">boot&lowbar;file</Literal> variable contains the filename to be
loaded by the secondary bootloader, while <Literal remap="tt">boot&lowbar;flags</Literal>
contains any extra flags.  <Literal remap="tt">auto&lowbar;action</Literal> specifies the
action which the console should take on power-up.  By default, it is
set to <Literal remap="tt">HALT</Literal>, meaning that the machine will start up in the
SRM console.  Once you have configured your bootloader and the
boot-related variables, you can set it to <Literal remap="tt">BOOT</Literal> in order to
boot automatically on power-up.
</Para>

<Para>
Finally, two helpful console keystrokes you should know are
Control-C, which, as in the shell, halts a command in progress (such
as an automatic boot), and Control-P, which if issued from the aboot
prompt (or other secondary bootloader) will halt the bootloader and
return you to the SRM console.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2 id="how-srm-boots">
<Title>How Does SRM Boot an OS?</Title>

<Para>
All versions of SRM can boot from SCSI disks and the versions for
recent platforms, such as the Noname or AlphaStations can boot from
floppy disks as well.  Network booting via <Literal remap="tt">bootp</Literal> is supported.
Note that older SRM versions (notably the one for the Jensen)
cannot boot from floppy disks. Booting from IDE devices
is supported on newer platforms ( 164SX, 164LX, 164UX, DS20, DS10, DP264, UP2000(+), UP1000, UP1100 etc..). 
</Para>

<Para>
Booting Linux with SRM is a two step process: first, SRM loads and
transfers control to the secondary bootstrap loader.  Then the
secondary bootstrap loader sets up the environment for Linux, reads
the kernel image from a disk filesystem and finally transfers control to Linux.
</Para>

<Para>
Currently, there are two secondary bootstrap loaders for Linux:
the <Emphasis>raw</Emphasis> loader that comes with the Linux kernel and <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal>
which is distributed separately.  These two loaders are described in
more detail below.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Loading The Secondary Bootstrap Loader</Title>

<Para>
SRM knows nothing about filesystems or disk-partitions.  It simply
expects that the secondary bootstrap loader occupies a consecutive
range of physical disk sector, starting from a given offset.  The
information on the size of the secondary bootstrap loader and the
offset of its first disk sector is stored in the first 512 byte
sector.  Specifically, the long integer at offset 480 stores the
<Emphasis>size</Emphasis> of the secondary bootstrap loader (in 512-byte blocks) and
the long at offset 488 gives the <Emphasis>sector number</Emphasis> at which the
secondary bootstrap loader starts.  The first sector also stores a
flag-word at offset 496 which is always 0 and a checksum at offset
504.  The checksum is simply the sum of the first 63 long integers in
the first sector.
</Para>

<Para>
If the checksum in the first sector is correct, SRM goes ahead and
reads the <Emphasis>size</Emphasis> sectors starting from the sector given in the
<Emphasis>sector number</Emphasis> field and places them in <Emphasis>virtual</Emphasis> memory at
address <Literal remap="tt">0x20000000</Literal>.  If the reading completes successfully,
SRM performs a jump to address <Literal remap="tt">0x20000000</Literal>.

<Title>The Raw Loader</Title>

<Para>
The sources for this loader can be found in directory
<Literal remap="tt">arch/alpha/boot</Literal> of the Linux kernel source
distribution.  It loads the Linux kernel by reading
<Literal remap="tt">START&lowbar;SIZE</Literal> bytes starting at disk offset
<Literal remap="tt">BOOT&lowbar;SIZE+512</Literal> (also in bytes).  The constants
<Literal remap="tt">START&lowbar;SIZE</Literal> and <Literal remap="tt">BOOT&lowbar;SIZE</Literal> are defined in
<Literal remap="tt">linux/include/asm-alpha/system.h</Literal>.  <Literal remap="tt">START&lowbar;SIZE</Literal>
must be at least as big as the kernel image (i.e., the size of the
<Literal remap="tt">.text</Literal>, <Literal remap="tt">.data</Literal>, and <Literal remap="tt">.bss</Literal> segments).  Similarly,
<Literal remap="tt">BOOT&lowbar;SIZE</Literal> must be at least as big as the image of the raw
bootstrap loader.  Both constants should be an integer multiple of the
sector size, which is 512 bytes.  The default values are currently 2MB
for <Literal remap="tt">START&lowbar;SIZE</Literal> and 16KB for <Literal remap="tt">BOOT&lowbar;SIZE</Literal>.  Note
that if you want to boot from a 1.44MB floppy disk, you have to reduce
<Literal remap="tt">START&lowbar;SIZE</Literal> to 1400KB and make sure that the kernel you
want to boot is no bigger than that.
</Para>

<Para>
To build a raw loader, simply type <Literal remap="tt">make rawboot</Literal> in the top
directory of your linux source tree (typically
<Literal remap="tt">/usr/src/linux</Literal>).  This should produce the following files in
<Literal remap="tt">arch/alpha/boot</Literal>:
</Para>

<Para>
<VariableList>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal remap="tt">tools/lxboot</Literal>:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
The first
sector on the disk.  It contains the offset and size of
the next file in the format described above.
</Para>
</Listitem>

</Listitem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal remap="tt">vmlinux.nh</Literal>:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
The raw kernel image consisting of
the <Literal remap="tt">.text</Literal>, <Literal remap="tt">.data</Literal>, and <Literal remap="tt">.bss</Literal> segments of the
object file in <Literal remap="tt">/usr/src/linux/vmlinux</Literal>.  The
extension <Literal remap="tt">.nh</Literal> indicates that this file has no object-file
header.
</Para>
</Listitem>
</VarListEntry>
</VariableList>
</Para>

<Para>
The concatenation of these three files should be written to the
disk from which you want to boot.  For example, to boot from a floppy,
insert an empty floppy disk in, say, <Literal remap="tt">/dev/fd0</Literal> and then type:

<Screen>
# cat tools/lxboot tools/bootlx vmlinux &#62;/dev/fd0
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
You can then shutdown the system and boot from the floppy by
issuing the command <Literal remap="tt">boot dva0</Literal>.

The latest sources for <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> are available from <ULink
URL="ftp://ftp.alphalinux.org/pub/Linux-Alpha/aboot"
>alphalinux.org</ULink> and <ULink URL="http://www.alphalinux.org/mirrors">alphalinux.org mirrors</ULink>. They can
also be obtained via CVS from www.alphalinux.org, to get the latest version from CVS use these commands:
<Screen>
bash$ export CVSROOT=':pserver:anonymous@www.alphalinux.org:/home/axplinux/cvs/development'
bash$ cvs login
bash# cvs -z3 co aboot
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
The description in this manual applies to <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> version 0.6
or newer. Please note that many distributions ship aboot with them so
downloading aboot from this directory is probably not neccesary.
</Para>

<Para>
 Once you downloaded and extracted the latest tar file, take a
look at the <Literal remap="tt">README</Literal> and <Literal remap="tt">INSTALL</Literal> files for
installation hints.  In particular, be sure to adjust the variables in
<Literal remap="tt">Makefile</Literal> and in <Literal remap="tt">include/config.h</Literal> to match your
environment.  Normally, you won't need to change anything when
building under Linux, but it is always a good idea to double check.
If you're satisfied with the configuration, simply type <Literal remap="tt">make</Literal>
to build it (if you're not building under Linux, be advised that
<Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> requires GNU <Literal remap="tt">make</Literal>).

<Title>Floppy Installation</Title>

<Para>
 The bootloader can be installed on a floppy using the
<Literal remap="tt">e2writeboot</Literal> command (note: this can't be done on a Jensen since
its firmware does <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> support booting from floppy).  This command
requires that the disk is not overly fragmented as it needs to find
enough contiguous file blocks to store the entire <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> image
(currently about 90KB).  If <Literal remap="tt">e2writeboot</Literal> fails because of this,
reformat the floppy and try again (e.g., with <Literal remap="tt">fdformat(1)</Literal>).  For
example, the following steps install <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> on floppy disk
assuming the floppy is in drive <Literal remap="tt">/dev/fd0</Literal>:

<Screen>
# fdformat /dev/fd0
# mke2fs /dev/fd0
# e2writeboot /dev/fd0 bootlx
</Screen>

</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Harddisk Installation</Title>

<Para>
Since the <Literal remap="tt">e2writeboot</Literal> command may fail on highly fragmented
disks and since reformatting a harddisk is not without pain, it is
generally safer to install <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> on a harddisk using the
<Literal remap="tt">swriteboot</Literal> command.  <Literal remap="tt">swriteboot</Literal> requires that the first few
sectors are reserved for booting purposes.  We suggest that the disk
be partitioned such that the first partition starts at an offset of
2048 sectors.  This leaves 1MB of space for storing <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal>.  On
a properly partitioned disk, it is then possible to install <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal>
as follows (assuming the disk is <Literal remap="tt">/dev/sda</Literal>):

<Screen>
# swriteboot /dev/sda bootlx
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
On systems where partition <Literal remap="tt">c</Literal> in the entire disk it will be
necessary to 'force' the write of aboot. In this case use the <Literal remap="tt">-f</Literal>
flag followed by the partition number (in the case of partition <Literal remap="tt">c</Literal>
this is 3):

<Screen>
# swriteboot /dev/sda bootlx -f3
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
On a Jensen, you will want to leave some more space, since you need to
write a kernel to this place, too---2MB should be sufficient when
using compressed kernels.  Use <Literal remap="tt">swriteboot</Literal> as described in Section
<XRef LinkEnd="booting"> to write <Literal remap="tt">bootlx</Literal> together with the Linux
kernel.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>CD-ROM Installation</Title>

<Para>
 To make a CD-ROM bootable by SRM, simply build <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> as
described above.  Then, make sure that the <Literal remap="tt">bootlx</Literal> file is present
on the iso9660 filesystem (e.g., copy <Literal remap="tt">bootlx</Literal> to the directory
that is the filesystem master, then run <Literal remap="tt">mkisofs</Literal> on that
directory).  After that, all that remains to be done is to mark the
filesystem as SRM bootable.  This is achieved with a command of the
form:

<Screen>
# isomarkboot filesystem bootlx
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
The command above assumes that <Literal remap="tt">filesystem</Literal> is a file containing
the iso9660 filesystem and that <Literal remap="tt">bootlx</Literal> has been copied into the
root directory of that filesystem.  That's it!

<Sect2 id="Building-Linux">
<Title>Building the Linux Kernel</Title>

<Para>
A bootable Linux kernel can be built with the following steps.
During the <Literal remap="tt">make config</Literal>, be sure to answer "yes" to the question
whether you want to boot the kernel via SRM (for certain platforms
this is automatically selected).  Note that if you build a generic
kernel (by selecting "Generic" as the alpha system type), the kernel
is able to guess whether it is running under SRM or not.

<Screen>
# cd /usr/src/linux
# make config
# make dep
# make boot
# make modules (if applicable)
# make modules_install (if applicable)
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
The last command will build the file
<Literal remap="tt">arch/alpha/boot/vmlinux.gz</Literal> which can then be copied to the
disk from which you want to boot from.  In our floppy disk example
above, this would entail:

mentioned in <XRef LinkEnd="how-srm-boots">, that SRM knows <Emphasis>nothing</Emphasis>
about partitions or disklabels - it merely reads a boot block and

If a disk has no partition table, <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> pretends the disk

<Para>
As a special case, partition number 0 is used to request booting
from a disk that does not (yet) contain a file system.  When
specifying "partition" number 0, <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> assumes that the Linux
kernel is stored right behind the <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> image.  Such a layout
can be achieved with the <Literal remap="tt">swriteboot</Literal> command.  For example, to
setup a filesystem-less boot from <Literal remap="tt">/dev/sda</Literal>, one could use
the command:

<Screen>
# swriteboot /dev/sda bootlx vmlinux.gz
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
Booting a system in this way is not normally necessary.  The

<Title>The aboot.conf configuration file</Title>

<Para>
Since booting in that manner quickly becomes tedious, <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal>
allows to define short-hands for frequently used command lines.  In
particular, a single digit option (0-9) requests that <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> uses
the corresponding option string stored in file
<Literal remap="tt">/etc/aboot.conf</Literal>.  A sample <Literal remap="tt">aboot.conf</Literal> is shown below:

#
# aboot default configurations

<Para>
With this configuration file, the command

<Screen>
&#62;&#62;&#62; boot dka0 -fl 1
</Screen>

corresponds exactly to the boot command shown above.
</Para>

<Para>
Finally, at the <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> prompt, it is possible to enter one of the
single character flags ("0"-"9") to get the same effect as if that
flag had been specified in the boot command line.  As noted in the
help text cited above, you can also list the available default
configurations with the "l" command.
</Para>

<Sect4>
<Title>Selecting the Partition of /etc/aboot.conf</Title>

<Para>
When installed on a harddisk, <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> needs to know what
partition to search for the <Literal remap="tt">/etc/aboot.conf</Literal> file.  A newly
compiled <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> will search the <Emphasis>second</Emphasis> partition (e.g.,
<Literal remap="tt">/dev/sda2</Literal>).  Since it would be inconvenient to have to
recompile <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> just to change the partition number,
<Literal remap="tt">abootconf</Literal> allows to directly modify an installed <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal>.
Specifically, if you want to change <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> to use the <Emphasis>third</Emphasis>
partition on disk <Literal remap="tt">/dev/sda</Literal>, you'd use the command:

<Screen>
# abootconf /dev/sda 3
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
You can verify the current setting by simply omitting the partition
number.  That is: <Literal remap="tt">abootconf /dev/sda</Literal> will print the currently
selected partition number.  Note that <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> does have to be
installed already for this command to succeed.  As of version 0.6,
<Literal remap="tt">swriteboot</Literal> it will preserve the existing configuration when
installing a new <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> on a hard disk.
</Para>


<Para>
Since <Literal remap="tt">aboot </Literal> version 0.5, it is also possible to select the
<Literal remap="tt"> aboot.conf </Literal> partition via the boot command line. This can be
done with a command line of the form <Emphasis remap="it">a</Emphasis><Literal remap="tt">:</Literal><Emphasis remap="it">b</Emphasis>
where <Emphasis remap="it">a</Emphasis>
is the partition that holds <Literal remap="tt">/etc/aboot.conf</Literal> and <Emphasis remap="it">b</Emphasis> is a
single-letter option as described above (<Literal remap="tt">0</Literal>-<Literal remap="tt">9</Literal>, <Literal remap="tt">i</Literal>, or
<Literal remap="tt">h</Literal>). For example, if you type <Literal remap="tt">boot -fl "3:h" dka100</Literal> the
system boots from SCSI ID 1, loads <Literal remap="tt">/etc/aboot.conf</Literal> from the
third partition, prints its contents on the screen and waits for you
to enter the boot options.

<Title id="bootpd-setup">bootpd configuration</Title>
<Para>
The bootpd is the older way of making a bootp server and for the most part is not used anymore
in lieu of more modern DHCP servers that are capable of handling the protocol with minimal configuration
and more flexibility. This style of setup does not allow just any client to be granted a BOOTP request. 
Instead you must specify the ip address and MAC address of the allowed clients. Naturally this could get
quite tedious if you where say administrating more than a few machines. 
</Para>

<Para>
bootpd rpms can be found on older versions of RedHat's distributions like version 5.2 and below. Note:
the rpm itself is named bootp though the package does contain the bootpd filename. It is available
for download at your favorite RedHat <ulink url="ftp://ftp.freesoftware.com/.1/linux/redhat/old-releases/redhat-5.2/alpha/RedHat/RPMS/">mirror</ulink>.
The bootp package requires the tftp-server just as before and the location to where the files are grabbed from is the same.  
</Para>

<Para>
Once installed you must configure your inetd service to talk to the bootpd daemon. Uncomment the following line in your /etc/inetd.conf .

<Literal remap="tt">voodoo.alphalinux.org</Literal>, then an entry of the following form would

<Para>
This entry assumes that the machine's Ethernet address is
<Literal remap="tt">08012B1C51F8</Literal> and that its IP address is 192.12.69.254.  The
Ethernet address can be found with the <Literal remap="tt">show device</Literal> command of the
SRM console or, if Linux is running, with the <Literal remap="tt">ifconfig</Literal> command.
The entry also defines that if the client does not specify otherwise,
the file that will be booted is <Literal remap="tt">vmlinux.bootp</Literal> in directory
<Literal remap="tt">/tftpboot</Literal>.  For more information on configuring <Literal remap="tt">bootpd</Literal>,

<Sect2 id="Network-Booting">
<Title>Booting Over the Network</Title>

<Para>
Three steps are necessary before Linux can be booted via
a network.  First you need an Ethernet adapter that is supported by SRM.
Most version of SRM support the DE500 series of cards, with newer
versions (5.6 and later) also supporting the Intel EtherExpress/Pro series
of cards.
Second, you need to set the SRM environment variables to
enable booting via the bootp protocol and third you need to setup
another machine as the your boot server.  Enabling bootp in SRM is
usually done by setting the ewa0&lowbar;protocol (DE500 cards) or eia0&lowbar;protocol (Intel cards) variable to bootp.

<Para>
Next, power up the client machine and boot it, specifying the Ethernet adapter as the boot device. Typically, SRM calls the DEC based Ethernet adapter ewa0 and the Intel based adapter
eia0, so to boot from that device, you'd use the command: 
<screen>
      >>> boot ewa0

<Para>
The -fi and -fl options can be used as usual. For example,

In particular, you can ask aboot to prompt for Linux kernel arguments by specifying the option 
-fl i .

<Title>Updating the SRM console through BOOTP</Title>
<Para>
Updating your SRM console over the network through BOOTP is just as easy as booting the Linux kernel
in the same manner. The hardware prerequisites are the same as netbooting Linux. 
</Para>

<Para>
First you have to obtain an SRM image that is able to BOOTP over the network. These images normally
have a .exe extension. For DEC/Compaq Alpha products these images can be found at 
<ulink url="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/v5.8/">ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/v5.8/</ulink>. You can also find these files on the Alpha Systems Firmware Update CD-ROM. <ulink url="http://www.api-networks.com">API NetWorks</ulink> does not offer net bootable SRM images at this time though that may change in the near future.
</Para>

<Para>
For example say you had a DS20 and wanted to update it's firmware over the network using BOOTP. You would have to,
<OrderedList>
<Listitem><Para>Get the correct firmware image for the DS20 that supported BOOTP execution which in this case the filename is 
<Literal remap="tt">ds20_v5_8.exe </Literal> from  <ulink url="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/v5.8/">ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/v5.8/</ulink>.</Para>
</Listitem>
<Listitem>
<Para>Copy the file to the /tftpboot folder located on the BOOTP server.</Para>
</Listitem>
</OrderedList>
</Para>

<Para>
To execute the update from SRM you would do the following:
</Para>
<Screen>>>> b ewa0 -fi ds20_v5_8.exe</Screen>  
<Para>
SRM would then proceed to upgrade the firmware in the same fashion as if you had done the firmware update from a CD.

<Title>Partitioning Disks</Title>

<Sect3>
<Title>What is a disklabel?</Title>

<Para>
A disk label is a partition table. Unfortunately, there are several
formats the partition table can take, depending on the operating
system.
</Para>

<Para>
DOS partition tables are the standard used by Linux and
Windows. AlphaBIOS systems and every Linux kernel can read DOS
partition tables. Unfortunately, the SRM console's boot sector format
overlaps with parts of the DOS partition table on disk, and therefore
DOS partition tables cannot be used with SRM.
</Para>

<Para>
BSD disklabels are used by several variants of Unix, including
Tru64.  SRM's boot block does not conflict with the BSD disklabel (in
fact, the BSD disklabel resides entirely within "reserved" areas of
the first sector), and Linux can use a BSD disklabel, provided that
support for BSD disklabels has been compiled into the kernel.
</Para>

<Para>
To boot from a disk using SRM, a BSD disklabel is required. If the
disk is not a boot disk, the BSD disklabel is not required. A BSD
disklabel can be created using fdisk, the standard Linux disk
partitioning tool.
</Para>

</Sect3>

<Sect3>
<Title>Partitioning the Easy Way: a DOS Disklabel</Title>

<Para>
The simplest way to partition your disk is to let your Linux installer
do it for you, for example by using Red Hat's disk druid or fdisk.  On
Red Hat 6.1, this will produce a valid BSD disklabel, but
<Emphasis>only</Emphasis> if the disk in question previously contained one.  In
most cases, this will produce a DOS disklabel.  It will be readable by
Linux, but you will not be able to boot from it via SRM.  For this
reason, you will probably want to create a BSD disklabel manually in
order to boot Linux

<Para>
You'll notice some things: Partitions are letters instead of
numbers, from a-h Partition 'c' covers the whole of the disk. This is
the convention, don't touch it.  While you can see it, note down the
disk parameters as you'll use them more often than with the
DOS-disklabel approach
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
Creating a new partition uses the same procedure as the
DOS-disklabel approach, except that the partitions are referred to by
letter instead of number. That is, 'n' to make a new partition
followed by the partition letter followed by the starting block
followed by the end block
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

Setting partition type is slightly different, because the

<Para>
There are some important catches that you must be aware of when
partitioning using a BSD disklabel:

<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>

<Para>
Partition 'a' should start about 1M into the disk: don't start
it at sector 1, try starting at sector 10 (for example). This leaves
plenty of space for writing the boot block (see below)
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
There is a bug in some versions of fdisk which makes the disk
look one sector bigger than it actually is.  The listing when you
create the BSD disklabel is correct.  The last sector of partition 'c'
is correct.  The default last sector when creating a new partition is
1 sector too big
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
Always adjust for this extra sector. This bug exists in the
version of fdisk shipped with Red Hat 6.0. Not making an adjustment
for this problem almost always leads to "Access beyond end of device"
errors from the Linux kernel.
</Para>
</ListItem>

</ItemizedList>

</Para>

<Para>
Once you have made a BSD disklabel, continue the installation. After
installation, you can write a boot block to your disk to make it
bootable from SRM.

<Sect1>
<Title>Sharing a Disk With DEC Unix</Title>

<Para>
Unfortunately, DEC Unix doesn't know anything about Linux, so sharing
a single disk between the two OSes is not entirely trivial.  However,
it is not a difficult task if you heed the tips in this section.  The
section assumes you are using <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> version 0.5 or newer.
</Para>

<Sect2>
<Title>Partitioning the disk</Title>

<Para>
First and foremost: <Emphasis>never</Emphasis> use any of the Linux partitioning
programs (<Literal remap="tt">minlabel</Literal> or <Literal remap="tt">fdisk</Literal>) on a disk that is also
used by DEC Unix.  The Linux <Literal remap="tt">minlabel</Literal> program uses the same
partition table format as DEC Unix <Literal remap="tt">disklabel</Literal>, but there are
some incompatibilities in the data that <Literal remap="tt">minlabel</Literal> fills in, so
DEC Unix will simply refuse to accept a partition table generated by
<Literal remap="tt">minlabel</Literal>.  To setup a Linux <Literal remap="tt">ext2</Literal> partition under DEC
Unix, you'll have to change the disktab entry for your disk.  For the
purpose of this discussion, let's assume that you have an rz26 disk (a
common 1GB drive) on which you want to install Linux.  The disktab
entry under DEC Unix v3.2 looks like this (see file
<Literal remap="tt">/etc/disktab</Literal>):

<Screen>
rz26|RZ26|DEC RZ26 Winchester:\
        :ty=winchester:dt=SCSI:ns#57:nt#14:nc#2570:\

        :oh#1212416:ph#838444:bh#8192:fh#1024:
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
The interesting fields here are <Literal remap="tt">o</Literal><Emphasis remap="it">?</Emphasis>, and
<Literal remap="tt">p</Literal><Emphasis remap="it">?</Emphasis>, where <Emphasis remap="it">?</Emphasis> is a letter in the range
<Literal remap="tt">a</Literal>-<Literal remap="tt">h</Literal> (first through 8-th partition).  The <Literal remap="tt">o</Literal>
value gives the starting offset of the partition (in sectors) and the
<Literal remap="tt">p</Literal> value gives the size of the partition (also in sectors).
See <Literal remap="tt">disktab(4)</Literal> for more info.  Note that DEC Unix likes to
define overlapping partitions.  For the entry above, the partition
layout looks like this (you can verify this by adding up the various
<Literal remap="tt">o</Literal> and <Literal remap="tt">p</Literal> values):

<Screen>
  a    	b      	  d    	      e	     	  f
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|

                        c
|-----------------------------------------------|

                     g                 h
            |-----------------|-----------------|
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
DEC Unix insists that partition <Literal remap="tt">a</Literal> starts at offset 0 and that
partition <Literal remap="tt">c</Literal> spans the entire disk.  Other than that, you can
setup the partition table any way you like.
</Para>

<Para>
Let's suppose you have DEC Unix using partition <Literal remap="tt">g</Literal> and want to
install Linux on partition <Literal remap="tt">h</Literal> with partition <Literal remap="tt">b</Literal> being a
(largish) swap partition.  To get this layout without destroying the
existing DEC Unix partition, you need to set the partition types
explicitly.  You can do this by adding a <Literal remap="tt">t</Literal> field for each
partition.  In our case, we add the following line to the above
disktab entry.

<Screen>
	:ta=unused:tb=swap:tg=4.2BSD:th=resrvd8:
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
Now why do we mark partition <Literal remap="tt">h</Literal> as "reservd8" instead of "ext2"?
Well, DEC Unix doesn't know about Linux.  It so happens that partition
type "ext2" corresponds to a numeric value of 8, and DEC Unix uses the
string "reservd8" for that value.  Thus, in DEC Unix speak, "reservd8"
means "ext2".  OK, this was the hard part.  Now we just need to
install the updated disktab entry on the disk.  Let's assume the disk
has SCSI id 5.  In this case, we'd do:

<Screen>
# disklabel -rw /dev/rrz5c rz26
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
You can verify that everything is all right by reading back the
disklabel with <Literal remap="tt">disklabel -r /dev/rrz5c</Literal>.  At this point, you
may want to reboot DEC Unix and make sure the existing DEC Unix
partition is still alive and well.  If that is the case, you can shut
down the machine and start with the Linux installation.  Be sure to
skip the disk partitioning step during the install.  Since we already
installed a good partition table, you should be able to proceed and
select the 8th partition as the Linux root partition and the 2nd
partition as the swap partition.  If the disk is, say, the second SCSI
disk in the machine, then the device name for these partitions would
be <Literal remap="tt">/dev/sdb8</Literal> and <Literal remap="tt">/dev/sdb2</Literal>, respectively (note that
Linux uses letters to name the drives and numbers to name the
partitions, which is exactly reversed from what DEC Unix does; the
Linux scheme makes more sense, of course ;-).
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Installing <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal></Title>

<Para>
<Emphasis>First big caveat</Emphasis>: with the SRM firmware, you can boot one and
only one operating system per disk.  For this reason, it is generally
best to have at least two SCSI disks in a machine that you want to
dual-boot between Linux and DEC Unix.  Of course, you could also boot
Linux from a floppy if speed doesn't matter or over the network, if
you have a <Literal remap="tt">bootp</Literal>-capable server.  But in this section we assume
you want to boot Linux from a disk that contains one or more DEC Unix
partitions.
</Para>

<Para>
<Emphasis>Second big caveat</Emphasis>: installing <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> on a disk shared with
DEC Unix renders the first and third partition unusable (since those
<Emphasis>must</Emphasis> have a starting offset of 0).  For this reason, we recommend
that you change the size of partition <Literal remap="tt">a</Literal> to something that is just
big enough to hold <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> (1MB should be plenty).
</Para>

<Para>
Once these two caveats are taken care of, installing <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> is
almost as easy as usual: since partition <Literal remap="tt">a</Literal> and <Literal remap="tt">c</Literal> will
overlap with <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal>, we need to tell <Literal remap="tt">swriteboot</Literal> that this is
indeed OK.  We can do this under Linux with a command line of the
following form (again, assuming we're trying to install <Literal remap="tt">aboot</Literal> on
the second SCSI disk):

<Screen>
# swriteboot -f1 -f3 /dev/sdb bootlx
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
The <Literal remap="tt">-f1</Literal> means that we want to force writing <Literal remap="tt">bootlx</Literal> even
though it overlaps with partition 1.  The corresponding applies for
partition 3.
</Para>

<Para>
This is it.  You should now be able to shutdown the system and boot
Linux from the harddisk.  In our example, the SRM command line to do
this would be:

<Screen>
&#62;&#62;&#62; boot dka5 -fi 8/vmlinux.gz -fl root=/dev/sdb8

The SuSE 6.1 CD is not bootable from SRM console. SuSE have an
alternative approach which involves creating two boot floppies, the
images of which are included on the CD.  The boot disks can be created
in various ways, depending on the systems you have available
</Para>

<Para>
Writing the boot disks from a linux system
The command to use is dd. From the mount-point of SuSE CD 1, the commands are:

# dd if=disks/aboot of=/dev/fd0
# dd if=disks/install of=/dev/fd0
</Screen>

</Para>

For writing the boot disks from a windows system, the command to use
is rawrite. It is available on the CD.

<Screen>
 D:\tools\&#62; rawrite

<Title>Installation from the SuSE 6.3 CD</Title>

<Para>
The SuSE 6.3 CD-ROM is SRM bootable much like the RedHat 6.0 and 6.1 CD-ROMs. The best way
to start the install from SRM is to use the following command:

<Screen>
&#62;&#62;&#62; boot srm-device -flags 0
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
In the above, the SRM device names for your
CD-ROM drive is needed.  For Example if the machine had an IDE cdrom
installed as primary master the command would look like this:

<Screen>
&#62;&#62;&#62; boot dqa0 -flags 0
</Screen>

SuSE has added support to aboot to allow it to load initrd files. The above command will from the
CD-ROM drive and use config number 0 from the /etc/aboot.conf file. For other variations
on this refer to the SuSE installation guide.
