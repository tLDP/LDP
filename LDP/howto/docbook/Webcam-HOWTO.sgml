<sect2 id="conventions"> <title>Conventions Used in this Document</title>

<para> The following conventions are used in this document and are
outlined here for those who may not yet have a complete understanding
of how to access and control the underlying operating system in Linux,
which is usually via the Bash shell.  </para>

<para> First, filenames are referenced in a paragraph like so:
<filename>/path/file</filename> </para>

<para> Commands in Linux are executed (or 'called') at the command prompt,
otherwise known as the 'command line.'

If you are in the non-graphical (text-based) environment, you will usually
be presented with the Bash shell prompt which is a dollar sign: </para>

<para>
<screen>
   $</screen>
</para>

<para>
	...or the hash mark:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
   #</screen>
</para>

<para> ...if you have logged in as root or have otherwise acquired root, or
'superuser' privileges.

You can also access the Bash shell in the X window
system, otherwise known as X or X11, with an <ulink
url="http://invisible-island.net/xterm/">xterm</ulink> or similar
X-terminal-emulator.

Commands to be performed at the Bash prompt, but referenced in a paragraph
of this document, usually look like this: <command>do this now</command>
</para>

<para> Commands and/or the resulting output of commands may also be
outlined with screen output in their own paragraph or heading: </para>

<para>
<screen>
   $  date
   Sun Jul 27 22:37:11 CDT 2003</screen> </para>

<para>
	When a command is written in front of the Bash prompt (e.g.,
	<command>$ date</command> above), it is assumed the [Return]
	or [Enter] key has been pressed after the command, possibly
	followed by the output on a new line (e.g., as in the date in
	the above example).  </para>

<sect1 id="hardware">
<title>Enabling Support for Your (Webcam) Hardware in Linux</title>

<sect2 id="driver-intro">
<title>Drivers and Modules</title>
<para> For your webcam to work you will need support for the connection and support for the actual camera hardware. Those who are already versed in kernels and modules and how to load them should skip to <xref linkend="connection">, which addresses support of the connection type. If you know your USB, IEEE 1394 or whatever bus you will be connecting your camera to is already configured and working, you should move on to the list of specific webcam hardware listed in <xref linkend="models">. 
</para>
<para>
Webcam drivers are usually available one of three ways: within the kernel, as a compilable stand alone module, or available as a pre-compiled (packaged) binary driver from your Linux distribution.</para>

<sect3 id="kernel-modules">
<title>Module or In-Kernel?</title>
<para>
As a rule, often the stock kernel, or operating system, of your initial installation may already have support for what you need. Your Linux distribution vendor has likely enabled the most common options already, including the bus, or connection type, and drivers for common camera models. The driver exists either as a loadable module or within the already running kernel.
</para>
<para>
An easy way to tell if the driver is enabled is to use the <command>dmesg</command> command piped into <command>less</command> (for easy paging) to look for an acknowledgement that it was loaded when your system started up:</para>

<para>
<screen>
   $  dmesg | less
</screen>
</para>
<para>
...which may yield something like the following, depending on your hardware:
</para>
<para>
<screen>
   Dec 18 17:35:18 localhost kernel: hub 5-0:1.0: USB hub found
   Dec 18 17:35:18 localhost kernel: hub 5-0:1.0: 2 ports detected
   Dec 18 17:35:18 localhost kernel: Linux video capture interface: v1.00
   Dec 18 17:35:18 localhost kernel: quickcam: QuickCam USB camera found (driver version QuickCam USB $Date$)
   Dec 18 17:35:18 localhost kernel: quickcam: Kernel:2.6.7 bus:1 class:FF subclass:FF vendor:046D product:0840
   Dec 18 17:35:18 localhost kernel: quickcam: Sensor HDCS-1000/1100 detected
   Dec 18 17:35:18 localhost kernel: quickcam: Registered device: /dev/video0
   Dec 18 17:35:18 localhost kernel: usbcore: registered new driver quickcam
</screen>
</para>
<para>
If you don't see it, the particular driver may exist as a loadable module. If you know what that module is named, try using <filename>find</filename>; in this example we are looking for the 'ibmcam' module:<para>
<screen>
  $  find /lib/modules -name ibmcam.o
</screen>
<para>Note that up until the 2.4 series modules had the suffix <filename>.o</filename>; for 2.6+ series kernels this was replaced with <filename>.ko</filename>.</para>
<para>
You can get a list of all modules available by typing the following at the command line:</para>

<para>
<screen>
  $  ls -R /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel </screen>
</para>

<para> Where <command>`uname -r`</command>, surrounded by forward tick marks, is your kernel version number.

The following output is an example of what you might find in a USB
webcam-ready kernel , where everything is loaded as a module (all
but the relevant lines have been edited for brevity):</para>

<para>
<screen>
   ./usb: usbvideo.o usbcore.o ibmcam.o
</screen> </para>

<para>
Once you know which module your camera needs you can find out if it is already loaded 
by typing the following at the command line:
</para>
<para>
<screen>
   #  lsmod</screen></para>

<para> As shown by the prompt above, you will need to have root privileges
to do this.

You should get output similar to the following:</para>

<para>
<screen>
   cdrom                  29312   0  (autoclean) [sr_mod]
   usb-ohci               17888   0  (unused) 
   usbcore                56768   0  [scanner ibmcam usbvideo usb-ohci] 
   ibmcam                 39680   0
</screen>
</para>
<para> Most stock kernels are compiled with <filename>kmod</filename>, which enabling automatic loading of necessary modules when the appropriate hardware is detected. It may not always do so, however, so  if you don't have the particular module you're seeking loaded and
you think the module may be available, try loading
it manually with <command>modprobe</command>, as in the following using the <filename>ibmcam</filename> module as an example:</para>

<para>
<screen>
   # modprobe -v ibmcam</screen>
</para>

<para>
Drivers for specific webcam models, or links to project pages hosting code for drivers, are outlined in <xref linkend="models">. The drivers are usually available one of three ways: within the kernel, as a compilable stand alone module, or available as a pre-compiled binary from your Linux distribution.
</para>


<para>If the support for your driver is not found either enabled statically within the kernel or as a module, don't despair. Drivers for numerous models are in the Linux kernel source (available directly from <ulink url="http://www.kernel.org">kernel.org</ulink> source code repository), or in code offered separately from the kernel that can be configured to work with your current setup (see section <xref linkend="binary">. If your webcam driver is available in the kernel source but not enabled as a module or otherwise in your default system, you can either recompile the kernel from the source code you have or obtain a new version of the kernel source, either pre-packaged by your Linux distributor or directly from the previous link (as a so-called <quote>vanilla</quote> kernel).
If you are unfamiliar with the prerequisites and procedure of compiling your own kernel, I direct you to the <ulink
url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">Kernel HOWTO</ulink>
for more information.  </para>

<sect3 id="binary">
<title>Patching, Source-Only or Precompiled Binary?</title> 
<para>
You may find that your webcam is supported by only a kernel patch, by a source-only driver not requiring a kernel recompile, or you may even be lucky enough to have a distribution that makes a pre-compiled and packaged binary driver available for your computer's architecture. The procedure involved in the former is largely beyond the scope of this document and is probably best outlined in the documentation available on the web page of your particular model's driver found in <xref linkend="models">. Some further more general documentation on these processes are, however, addressed in <xref linkend="troubleshooting"></para></sect2>

<sect2 id="connection">

<title>Supporting the Connection Type</title>

<sect3 id="usb-type">

<title>USB Webcams</title>

<para> If you have a USB webcam, it is likely a Linux driver has been written for your device.

There are two ways of supporting USB devices in Linux.

One is the more traditional kernel support, and the other is through
libusb.

For at least one webcam category, the STV0680-based models, working 
libusb support is recommended, at least according to <ulink 
url="http://stv0680-usb.sourceforge.net/">the Sourceforge page 
on the subject</ulink>.</para>

<para>
Unless you know your driver requires libusb support, you should probably 
stick with the more conventional in-kernel support for USB devices beginning 
in <xref linkend="usb-kernel">.  </para>

<sect4 id="libusb">

<title>Libusb</title>

<para> Libusb is a library that allows access to the USB functions in
Linux through userspace and without the need to enable kernel support
and insert modules. 

Most distributions, at this point, are offering <ulink
url="http://libusb.sourceforge.net/">libusb</ulink> in their stable
branches (and some install it by default), so if you don't already have
kernel support for USB devices, then you may only have to install the
libusb package in order to access your device.

You must have USB device filesystem support enabled in your kernel,
which most distributions do.

To find out for sure, issue the following at the command line: </para>

<para>
<screen>
   $  cat /proc/filesystems</screen></para>
<para>You should see (among others):</para> <para> <screen>
   nodev    usbdevfs 
   nodev    usbfs
</screen> </para>

<para> You may need to mount usbdevfs to enable it and see the device
files, which you can do at the command line with <command>mount -t
usbdevfs none /proc/bus/usb</command>.

Don't try to use libusb while your particular <emphasis>kernel</emphasis>
webcam support is enabled either statically or the module loaded; you
can only use one at at time.</para>

<para> You can obtain the libusb package in <filename>.rpm</filename>,
<filename>.tgz</filename> or <filename>.deb</filename> format from your
Linux distribution.</para>

<sect4 id="usb-kernel">

<title>Linux Kernel USB Support</title>

<para> Kernel support is required for USB webcam support if not using
libusb (outlined above).</para>

<para>For 2.2 and 2.4 series kernels, your USB webcam may require the module <filename>usbvideo</filename>
to function. This is not required in the 2.6+ series.

<para> For generic USB bus support in Linux, you will need USB subsystem
support in your kernel, whether usb-ohci, usb-ehci, or whatever flavor
of USB driver your system prefers.

USB subsystem support has been present in the Linux kernel since the
late 2.2 series.

For a more in-depth discussion of USB support in general, I direct you to
the <ulink url="http://www.linux-usb.org/">Linux-usb project site</ulink>.

If you want to find out which modules are loaded, at the command line
or in an xterm, type the following:

<para>
<screen>
   #  lsmod
</screen>
</para>

<para> As shown by the prompt above, you will need to have root privileges
to do this.

You should get output similar to the following:</para>

<para>
<screen>
   cdrom	       29312   0  (autoclean) [sr_mod]
   usb-ohci	       17888   0  (unused) 
   usbcore             56768   0  [scanner ibmcam usbvideo usb-ohci] 
   ibmcam              39680   0
</screen>
</para>

<para> If you don't have the particular module you're seeking loaded and
you think the module may be available, try loading
it directly (using the usb ibmcam module as an example):</para>

<para>
<screen>
   #  modprobe -v ibmcam</screen>
</para>

<para> ...at which point you should see something like the
following:</para>

<para> <screen>
   Using /lib/modules/2.4.20/kernel/drivers/usb/ibmcam.o</screen></para>

<para> By placing the entry <filename>ibmcam</filename> (for example) in
<filename>/etc/modules</filename> (note that this varies by distribution),
you can have the module load at boot-time automatically.

You can then confirm the module was loaded by checking the syslog or in
the boot-time record with <command>dmesg | less</command>), where you
should see an entry such as the following:</para>

<para>
<screen>
   Oct 18 12:43:12 K7 kernel: hub.c: new USB device 00:02.3-2, assigned address 3 
   Oct 18 12:43:12 K7 kernel: ibmcam.c: IBM PC Camera USB camera found (model 2, rev. 0x030a)

</screen>
</para> </sect4>

<sect3 id="IEEE1394">

<title>IEEE 1394 (<trademark>Firewire</trademark>,
<trademark>i.Link</trademark>)</title>

<para> IEEE 1394 webcams require an IEEE 1394 PCI card or an IEEE 1394
bus port on your mainboard.

The IEEE interface has been supported in Linux since the early 2.4-series
kernel.

If you are lucky enough to own such a device, generic information
on support of the IEEE 1394 bus in Linux can be found at <ulink
url="http://www.linux1394.org">www.linux1394.org</ulink>.

If you have a kernel older than 2.4.2, you will need to
patch your kernel with one of the patches found on <ulink
url="http://download.sourceforge.net/linux1394">this page</ulink>
matched to your kernel version.

In addition, you will require <ulink
url="http://download.sourceforge.net/libraw1394">libraw1394</ulink>.

The previously referenced linux1394.org site has a great installation
guide.</para>

<para> The <ulink
url="http://www.tele.ucl.ac.be/PEOPLE/DOUXCHAMPS/ieee1394/cameras/">IEEE1394
Digital Camera List</ulink>, by Damien Douxchamps, offers an outstanding
summary of the capabilities of IEEE 1394 cameras as well as the current
status of support for individual models.  </para> 

<sect3 id="parport-general">

<title>Generic Parallel Port Support for Parport Webcams</title>

<para> For 2.2 and 2.4 kernel systems, parallel-port support must be
enabled statically or as a module (stock kernels usually have this
enabled by default).

You may want to read <ulink url="http://www.torque.net/linux-pp.html">more
generic info about parallel-port device support under the Linux
kernel</ulink> before starting this process.

To find out for sure if the module <filename>parport</filename> is loaded,
you can check the <filename>dmesg</filename> file or use <command>
lsmod </command> as outlined above.

Using <command>dmesg | less</command>, you should see (among many other
lines) the following: </para>

<para>
<screen>
   Mar  3 08:00:25 K7 kernel: parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778) [PCSPP,TRISTATE] 
   Mar  3 08:00:25 K7 kernel: parport0: irq 7 detected
</screen>
</para>

<para> If you are compiling your own kernel, enable 'Parallel Port
support'.

You should enable 'IEEE 1284 transfer modes', and if you have x86 type
architecture, you should also enable 'PC-style hardware'.  </para>

<para> If modprobe returns an error when you attempt to load the module,
note that you may need to determine and supply the hardware address when
invoking <command>modprobe</command>.

The most common address is 0x378 for an x86 system; 0x278 and 0x3BC are
other possibilities for integrated or ISA parallel ports.

Add-in PCI parallel ports may have unusual base addresses.

You can also arrange multiple devices with either the parport_pc or
parport_arc modules, though that topic is beyond the scope of this
document.

<emphasis>WARNING: </emphasis>Be sure you have the correct address before
entering this information at the command line or else your machine may
become unstable, crash or otherwise implode.</para>

<para> Your parallel port should be set to preferably <quote>EPP</quote>
mode, or alternatively ECP/EPP.

<quote>Bidirectional</quote> (also known as <quote>BPP</quote> or
<quote>PS/2</quote>) may work, albeit much more slowly.

<quote>Unidirectional</quote> mode is unsuitable for scanning.

The above setting can usually be accessed through your BIOS menu, at
least on x86 systems.</para> </sect3>

<sect1 id="dev-intro">

<title>Accessing the Video Device</title> <para> The following
section applies to all connection types.  </para> 

<sect2 id="dev-manual">

<title>The Video Devices Node</title>

<para>The Linux kernel requires a virtual device node be created to access and control the device in question. It may have already been created for you at boot-up; <command>ls -l /dev/video*</command> (with an asterisk) or alternatively <command>find /dev -name video*</command> or even visual inspection of the <filename>/dev</filename> directory with your favorite file manager can give you an idea if the video devices exist. If so you can proceed to <xref linkend="permissions">; if not you will need to create them manually.</para>

<para>An easy way to create them, if available with your Linux distribution, is use of the <filename>MAKEDEV</filename> script, which may be located in <filename>/dev</filename> or the usual places for storing executable commands (<filename>/bin</filename>,<filename>/sbin</filename> and so on). The manual page for <filename>MAKEDEV</filename> (<command>man MAKEDEV</command>) can guide you further, but be aware of the device-specific command options. If <filename>MAKEDEV</filename> doesn't work or doesn't exist, or you just prefer doing things the hard way, move on to the next paragraph.
</para>

<para>
A device can be created as a block (such as a drive), a fifo
(file-in-file-out or pipe, as in xconsole) or a character device, which
represents other hardware.

Each device has a major and a minor number <quote>coordinate</quote>
to tell the kernel what it is and where to access it.

These numbers are not arbitrary. The major number 81 with minor number 0, 1, 2, and so on are by convention assigned to Video4linux devices, including TV tuner boards and webcams. In order to create the video device <filename>/dev/video0</filename>, use <command>mknod</command> at the command line:
</para>
<para>
<screen>
   #  mknod /dev/video0 c 81 0
</screen>
</para>
<para>
where <command>c</command> represents a character device.</para>

<para>

You can use the following script, which I
have borrowed from the kernel source (located in
<filename>linux/Documentation/video4linux/bttv/MAKEDEV</filename> of
the source tree):</para>

<para>
<screen>
   #!/bin/bash
   function makedev () {
	for dev in 0 1 2 3; do echo "/dev/$1$dev:
	char 81 $[ $2 + $dev ]" rm -f /dev/$1$dev
	mknod /dev/$1$dev c 81 $[ $2 + $dev ] chmod
	666 /dev/$1$dev
   	done

   	# symlink for default device
	rm -f /dev/$1 ln -s /dev/${1}0 /dev/$1
   	}

	# see http://roadrunner.swansea.uk.linux.org/v4lapi.shtml
	echo "*** new device names ***" makedev video
	0 makedev radio 64 makedev vtx 192 makedev vbi 224
	# "*** old device names (for compatibility only) ***"
	#makedev bttv 0 #makedev bttv-fm 64 #makedev bttv-vbi 224
</screen>
</para>

<para> Simply copy and paste the above into your favorite editing program,
save it as MAKEDEV or whatever name you like, make it executable
(i.e., <command>chmod u+x MAKEDEV</command>), and then execute it as root: </para>

<para>

<screen>
   #  ./MAKEDEV
</screen>
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="permissions">

<title>Groups and Permissions</title>

<para> It is a good idea to be sure that your user account can access
the device once all modules are loaded and device nodes created.

The most security-conscious way to do that is to add access for a
particular group.

On my system, the members of the group 'video' are allowed to use the
webcam, scanner and other photographic devices.

The way to accomplish this is to first change the ownership of the
devices in <filename>/dev</filename> like so (as root): </para>

<para>
<screen>
   #  chown root.video /dev/usb/video*
</screen>
</para>

<para> ...where <command>root.video</command> are the owner and group
the device will now belong to.

Obviously, the specific command will vary by your system and the type
of device.

It is important that you change the ownership of the device node itself
and not the symlink; symlinks' ownerships are affected only by changing
the parent devices or files they point to.  </para>

<para> To see if your user account is a member of the group in question,
as root issue the following command:

<command>grep -e video /etc/group</command>.

You should see something like the following:</para>

<para>
<screen>
   video:x:44:
</screen>
</para>

<para> ...where '44' is the group number.

Since no members follow the last colon in the 'video' group, we can add
them, let's say user 'jhs' with the command</para>

<para>
<screen>
   #  adduser jhs  video
</screen>
</para>

<para> After this, it's simply a matter of allowing read and write access
for the user in question of the device like so: </para>

<para>
<screen>
   #  chmod g+rw /dev/v4l/video0
</screen>
</para>

<para> ...where <command>g+rw</command> means add <command>r</command>ead
and <command>w</command>rite access for <command>g</command>roup.

See the documentation for chmod (<command>man chmod</command> or
<command>info chmod</command>) for further info.</para> </sect2> </sect1>

<sect3 id="Streamer"> <title>Streamer</title>

<para> Streamer is a versatile program that allows a capture from a
webcam or video device using only the command line.

It may be offered in your Linux distribution's Xawtv package, or may need to be fetched separately as in Debian. You can find it and more information at <ulink url="http://www.bytesex.org/xawtv">Gerd Knorr's Xawtv homepage</ulink>. 
<para>To take a standard JPEG picture from the command line where
the camera is accessed through <filename>/dev/video0</filename>: </para>

<para> 
<screen>
   $  streamer -c /dev/video0 -b 16 -o outfile.jpeg
</screen>
</para>

<para> ...where <command>-b</command> is the number of colors (in bpp,
whether 15, 16, 24 or 32) and <command>-o</command> is the output
filename that will be dropped into the current directory (specify
<command> -o </command><filename>/path/outfile.jpg</filename> to place
it elsewhere). If you are going to capture multiple images be sure to append the output file name with zeros, as streamer can name the capture files in sequence, i.e., <command>-o </command><filename>outfile000.jpeg</filename> becomes <filename>outfile001.jpeg</filename>, <filename>outfile002.jpeg</filename>, and so on.</para>

<para> To make an .avi file: </para>

<para>
<screen>
   $  streamer -q -c /dev/video0 -f rgb24 -r 3 -t 00:30:00 -o /home/jhs/outfile.avi
</screen>
</para>

<para> ...where <command>-q</command> is for 'quiet' execution (no message
output), <command>-f</command> is 'format' (rgb24 is TrueColor avi),
<command>-r</command> is the frames per second and <command>-t</command>
is the time of recording (30 minutes).

Streamer can capture raw and <trademark>Quicktime</trademark>
(non-Sorensen) formats and can capture audio as well.

See <command>streamer --help</command> for more information.  </para>

<sect3 id="camE"> <title>camE</title>

<para> CamE is a command-line program that works in daemon mode to
capture frames from your v4l device for archive or upload (to a webserver,
for example) via ftp or scp.

You can overlay other graphics, timestamp the frames, or add other dynamic
text all by altering the appropriate line in the configuration file.

See <ulink url="http://linuxbrit.co.uk/camE/">the camE homepage</ulink>
for more information.  </para>

<sect3 id="motion"> <title>Motion</title>

<para> Motion is a brilliant program that is able to monitor the video
signal from one or several webcams.

It can record periodic snapshots, and when motion is detected, record an
mpeg and/or perform another action such as sending an email or executing
a command.

It can track and graphically mark the motion it detects, feed files via an
http server to your website, stream them to another application and more.

The number
of command line options may be intimidating; there is however, a <ulink
url="http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Motion/MotionGuide">Wiki
available online</ulink> that outlines the various command and
configuration file options nicely.

The motion homepage can be found <ulink

</para>

<sect3 id="webcam"><title>Webcam</title>
<para>Webcam is an automated command line tool for operating a webcam that is also available from 
<ulink url="http://www.bytesex.org/xawtv">the Xawtv homepage</ulink>. It is excellent for automated operation such as from a cron job, as it requires no 
command line options, only a previously edited configuration file (usually <filename>~/.webcamrc</filename>). It is similar to camE above in that one can captures images and upload them to a Web-Server via ftp or ssh.
</para>

<sect3 id="sane"> <title>SANE</title>

<para> SANE, or Scanner Access Now Easy, supports access of v4l devices including webcams in later versions.

If you are familiar with using a photographic scanner device in Linux,
you may be interested in using SANE for image capture, especially since
a few devices double as both scanners and digital cameras.

<para> Xawtv is an X-based program for accessing video devices
in Linux including TV tuning devices and webcams.

The home page is at <ulink

<para> When you first try out your webcam, and you think things are
configured right, use the -hwscan option: </para>

<para>
<screen>
   $  xawtv -hwscan This is xawtv-3.72, running on Linux/i686 (2.4.21) looking for available devices
      
   /dev/v4l/video0: OK		[ -device /dev/v4l/video0 ] type : v4l name : BT878(Hauppauge (bt878)) flags: overlay capture tuner
   /dev/v4l/video1: OK		[ -device /dev/v4l/video1 ] type : v4l name : IBM USB Camera           flags: capture
</screen>
</para>

<para> ...so now you can see the available devices (your output may
differ substantially).

Try opening an xterm and running xawtv, grabbing from your webcam video
device: </para>

<para>
<screen>
   $  xawtv -c /dev/video1 This is xawtv-3.72, running on Linux/i686 (2.4.21)
</screen>
</para>

<para> ...and (hopefully) your camera will begin capturing to a window
on your desktop.

You may see some error messages in your xterm if things don't work that
can be helpful to diagnose configuration problems.

If you aren't interested in all that, and things work for you, launch
from your window manager's menu next time.

You can read about more xawtv options with <command>man xawtv</command>.

</para>

<sect2 id="src"> <title>Help, my camera has a driver that is source-only,
i.e., has to be built by me! Where do I start?</title> <para> First, check
if your Linux distribution offers a pre-compiled binary of the driver. You 
can then load it as you normally would for a module.

If that is not the case, be sure you have kernel sources installed.

You will also need at a minimum GNU make, gcc, binutils and perhaps
other programs installed depending on your distribution. 

(Debian users should see the next section for instructions specific 
to that distribution.)
</para>

<para>
Download the driver source (in this example named
<filename>src.tar.gz</filename>) and uncompress/untar it: </para>

<para>
<screen>
   $  tar -xvzf src.tar.gz
</screen>
</para>
<para>
Then, change to the directory of your kernel source:
</para>
<para>
<screen>
   #  cd /usr/src/linux
</screen>
</para>
<para>
Make the necessary source files:
</para>
<para>
<screen>
   #  make oldconfig # make dep
</screen>
</para>
<para>
Now, change to the directory where you unpacked the driver source and
read the README and/or INSTALL files for instructions on how to make
the driver.

Usually this involves some combination of "make" "make all" and/or
"make install."

Assuming it compiles correctly, you can simply load the new module with
<command>modprobe</command>.

If you have any problems, see <xref linkend="morehelp">.  </para>
<para>

<sect2 id="debsrc">
<title>I am using Debian GNU/Linux. Is there an easier way to go through all this kernel compiling stuff and building of source modules?</title>
<para>
It is far simpler, in your author's humble opinion, to use the automated <filename>kernel-package
</filename> utility.

First, install it and the dependencies using <command>apt-get</command>. Next, 
install the kernel source that you want (e.g., <command>apt-get install 
kernel-source-2.X.X</command>). Untar the bzip2'd kernel source  with <command>tar 
-xvjf</command> and then make a symbolic link called <filename>linux</filename> that points to the new source:

</para>
<para>
<screen>
   #  ln -s /usr/src/kernel-source-2.X.X /usr/src/linux
 </screen>
</para>
<para>
Then <command>cd /usr/src/linux</command> and clean: <command>make-kpkg clean</command>, followed
by <command>make menuconfig</command> or <command>make xconfig</command> as you would if compiling
a new kernel. Next, you can use <command>make-kpkg kernel_image</command> and then install your new
kernel package that has been deposited in <filename>/usr/src</filename> with <command>dpkg -i ../kernel-image-2.X.X</command>. Next, you can get the pre-packaged 
source driver using <filename>apt</filename>. So, in the case of the Quickcam Express, the package is <filename>qc-usb-source</filename>:
</para>
<para>
<screen>
   #  apt-get install qc-usb-source
</screen>
</para>
<para>
...and untar the archive:
</para>
<para>
<screen>
   #  tar -xvzf qc-usb-modules.tar.gz
</screen>
<para>
This will uncompress the source into the <filename>/usr/src/modules</filename> directory. The final step, while still in <filename>/usr/src/linux</filename> is to make the modules with kernel-package:
</para>
<para>
<screen>
   #  make-kpkg modules_image
</screen>
</para>
<para>
Install the new package, in <filename>/usr/src/</filename>, called <filename>qc-usb-modules-[arch].deb</filename> using <command> dpkg -i</command>. Finally, load the module:
</para>
<para>
<screen>
   #  modprobe quickcam
</screen>
</para>
<para>
Check the documentation in /usr/share/doc/kernel-package for any problems.</para>

<sect2 id="patch"> <title>Help, my camera is supported by a driver that

<para> The short and unguaranteed version of patching, by your humble
author, goes as follows: Be sure you have the same prerequisites outlined
in <xref linkend="src"> installed.

First, on the command line or in an xterm change to the source directory
of the kernel version you are (or will be) running with the camera patch

<screen>
   #  cd /usr/src/linux 
   #  patch -p1 -E patch.diff

<para> You should see a confirmation that the 'hunks' were successfully
applied.

At this point, you can <command>make menuconfig</command> or whatever

<appendix id="appendix"> <title>Gnu Free Documentation License</title>

<para>
	Version 1.2, November 2002
</para>

<para>
	Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
	59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA	02111-1307  USA Everyone
	is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
	license document but changing it is not allowed.
</para>

<para> 0. PREAMBLE </para>

<para>
	The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
	or other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of
	freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
	redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially
	or noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
	author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while
	not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.
</para>

<para>
	This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
	works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
	It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
	cense designed for free software.
</para>

<para>
	We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
	free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
	free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
	that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
	software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
	of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
	We recommend this License principally for works in which its
	purpose is instruction or reference.
</para>

<para> 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS </para>

<para>
	This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
	that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
	it can be distributed under the terms of this License.	Such a
	notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in
	duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein.
	The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.
	Any member of the public is a licensee and is addressed as "you".
	You accept the license if you copy, modify, or distribute the
	work in a way, thus requiring permission under copyright law.
</para>

<para>
	A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing
	the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
	modifications and/or translated into another language.
</para>

<para>
	A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
	section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
	relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
	Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
	nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
	(Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,
	a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)  The
	relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
	the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
	philosophical, ethical, or political position regarding them.
</para>

<para>
	The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections in which
	titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
	in the notice that says that the Document is released under
	this License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
	Secondary, then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
	The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
	does not identify any Invariant Sections, then there are none.
</para>

<para>
	The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
	listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
	that says that the Document is released under this License.
	A Front-Cover Text may be at most five words, and a Back-Cover
	Text may be at most 25 words.
</para>

<para>
	A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable
	copy, represented in a format where its specification is available
	to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document
	straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
	composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
	widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input
	to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
	formats suitable for input to text formatters.	A copy made in an
	otherwise Transparent file format in which its markup, or absence
	of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
	modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format
	is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.
	A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
</para>

<para>
	Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
	plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX
	input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
	standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
	human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
	PNG, XCF, and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats
	that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
	SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not
	generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript
	or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.
</para>

<para>
	The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
	plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
	material this License requires to appear in the title page.
	For works in formats, which do not have any title page as such,
	"Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
	the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
</para>

<para>
	A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
	in which its title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ
	in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another
	language.  (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned
	below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements",
	or "History".)	To "Preserve the Title" of such a section,
	when you modify the Document, means that it remains a section
	"Entitled XYZ", according to this definition.
</para>

<para>
	The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
	which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
	Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference
	in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties:
	any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have
	is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.
</para>

<para> 2. VERBATIM COPYING </para>

<para>
	You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
	commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
	copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
	applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that
	you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.
	You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
	reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.
	However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.
	If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also
	follow the conditions in section 3.
</para>

<para>
	You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
	and you may publicly display copies.
</para>

<para> 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY </para>

<para>
	If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
	have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,
	and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
	enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
	all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover,
	and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also
	clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.
	The front cover must present the full title with all words of the
	title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
	on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
	covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
	satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
	other respects.
</para>

<para>
	If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
	fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as
	fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
	adjacent pages.
</para>

<para>
	If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the
	Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a
	machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy,
	or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location
	from which the general network-using public has access to download
	using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
	copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
	latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when
	you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
	that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
	stated location until at least one year after the last time you
	distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
	retailers) of that edition to the public.
</para>

<para>
	It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors
	of the Document well before redistributing any large number of
	copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
	version of the Document.
</para>

<para> 4. MODIFICATIONS </para>

<para>
	You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
	under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that
	you release the Modified Version under precisely this License,
	with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document,
	thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified
	Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you
	must do these things in the Modified Version:
</para>

<para>
	A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
	distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
	versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
	History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
	as a previous version if the original publisher of that version
	gives permission.
</para>

<para>
	B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
	entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
	Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
	authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
	fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.
</para>

<para>
	C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
	Modified Version, as the publisher.
</para>

<para>
	D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
</para>

<para>
	E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
	adjacent to the other copyright notices.
</para>

<para>
	F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
	notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
	under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the
	Addendum below.
</para>

<para>
	G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
	Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
	license notice.
</para>

<para>
	H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
</para>

<para>
	I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
	and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
	authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
	the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History"
	in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
	and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then
	add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
	previous sentence.
</para>

<para>
	J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
	for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document and
	likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous
	versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History"
	section.  You may omit a network location for a work that was
	published at least four years before the Document itself, or
	if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives
	permission.
</para>

<para>
	K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
	Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
	the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
	and/or dedications given therein.
</para>

<para>
	L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
	in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
	equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
</para>

<para>
	M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".	Such a section
	may not be included in the Modified Version.
</para>

<para>
	N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
	"Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
</para>

<para>
	O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.  If the Modified Version
	includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify
	as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
	Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these
	sections as invariant.	To do this, add their titles to the list
	of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
	These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
	You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it
	contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
	various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
	the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
	definition of a standard.
</para>

<para>
	You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
	Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text,
	to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.
	Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text
	may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.
	If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
	previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
	entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another;
	but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from
	the previous publisher that added the old one.
</para>

<para>
	The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
	License give permission to use their names for publicity for or
	to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
</para>

<para> 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS </para>

<para>
	You may combine the Document with other documents released under
	this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
	modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
	all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
	unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
	combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
	their Warranty Disclaimers.
</para>

<para>
	The combined work need only contain one copy of this License,
	and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with
	a single copy.	If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
	the same name but different contents, make the title of each
	such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses,
	the name of the original author or publisher of that section if
	known, or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the
	section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license
	notice of the combined work.
</para>

<para>
	In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
	"History" in the various original documents, forming one section
	Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
	"Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".
	You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".
</para>

<para> 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS </para>

<para>
	You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
	documents released under this License, and replace the individual
	copies of this License in the various documents with a single
	copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow
	the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
	documents in all other respects.
</para>

<para>
	You may extract a single document from such a collection and
	distribute it individually under this License, provided you
	insert a copy of this License into the extracted document and
	follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
	copying of that document.
</para>

<para> 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS </para>

<para>
	A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
	separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
	a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
	copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
	legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
	works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate,
	this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate
	which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
</para>

<para>
	If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
	copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
	half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
	placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate,
	or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in
	electronic form.  Otherwise, they must appear on printed covers
	that bracket the whole aggregate.
</para>

<para> 8. TRANSLATION </para>

<para>
	Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
	distribute translations of the Document under the terms of
	section 4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations
	requires special permission from their copyright holders, but
	you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections
	in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
	You may include a translation of this License, and all the license
	notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided
	that you also include the original English version of this License
	and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers.
	In case of a disagreement between the translation and the
	original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer,
	the original version will prevail.
</para>

<para>
	If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
	"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
	Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing
	the actual title.
</para>

<para> 9. TERMINATION </para>

<para>
	You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
	except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
	attempt to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
	is void and will automatically terminate your rights under
	this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
	rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
	terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
</para>

<para> 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE </para>

<para>
	The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
	the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
	versions will be similar in spirit to the present version
	but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
	See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
</para>

<para>
	Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
	number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
	version of this License "or any later version" applies to it,
	you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
	of that specified version or of any later version that has
	been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
	If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
	you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft)
	by the Free Software Foundation.
</para>

<para> ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents </para>

<para>
	To use this License in a document you have written, include
	a copy of the License in the document and put the following
	copyright and license notices just after the title page:
</para>

<para>
	Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.  Permission is granted to copy,
	distribute, and/or modify this document under the terms of the
	GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version
	published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant
	Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.  A copy
	of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free
	Documentation License".
</para>

<para>
	If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
	Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this: with the
	Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover
	Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
	If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
	combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit
	the situation.
</para>

<para>
	If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code,
	we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
	choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public
	License, to permit their use in free software.
