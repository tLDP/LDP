<Para>
This document describes the Miniloader for Linux on Alpha AXP (MILO).
This firmware is used to initialize Alpha AXP based systems, load and
start Linux and, finally, provide PALcode for Linux. Please note that
the prefered way of booting Linux is via SRM console and MILO should
only be used if either there is no SRM console for your hardware (XL series)
or your current hardware isn't supported by SRM.

<Title>What is MILO? </Title>

<Para>
On Intel based PC systems, the BIOS firmware
sets up the system and then loads the image to be run from the boot 
block of a DOS file system.
This is more or less what MILO does on an Alpha based system,
however there are several interesting differences between BIOS firmware and
MILO, not least of which is that MILO includes and 
uses standard Linux device drivers unmodified.
MILO is firmware, unlike LILO, which relies on the BIOS firmware to 
get itself loaded.
The main functional parts of MILO are:
</Para>

<Para>

<OrderedList>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 PALcode,
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 Memory set up code (builds page tables and turns on virtual addressing),
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 Video code (BIOS emulation code and TGA (21030)),
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 Linux kernel code.  This includes real Linux
kernel code (for example, the interrupt handling) and 
ersatz or mock Linux kernel,
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 Linux block device drivers (for example, the floppy driver),
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 File system support (ext2, MS-DOS and ISO9660),
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 User inteface code (MILO),
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 Kernel interface code (sets up the HWRPB and memory map for linux),
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 NVRAM code for managing environment variables.
</Para>
</ListItem>

</OrderedList>

</Para>

<Para>
The following paragraphs describe these functional parts in more detail.
</Para>

<Para>
PALcode can be thought of as a tiny software layer that tailors the
chip to a particular operating system.  
It runs in a special mode (PALmode) which has certain restrictions but it
uses the standard Alpha instruction set with just five extra instructions.
In this way, the Alpha chip can run such diverse operating systems as
Windows NT, OpenVMS, Digital Unix and, of course, Linux.
The PALcode that MILO uses (and therefore Linux itself)
is, like the rest of MILO, freeware.
It is derived from Digital's Evaluation Board software example Digital Unix
PALcode..
The differences between the different PALcodes are because of 
differences in address mapping and interrupt handling that
exist between the Alpha chips (21066 based systems have 
a different I/O map to 21064+2107x systems) and different
Alpha based systems.
</Para>

<Para>
For MILO to operate properly it needs to know what memory 
is available, where Linux will eventually be running from and it must be
able to allocate temporary memory for the Linux device drivers.
The code maintains a memory map that has entries for permanent and temporary
allocated pages.
As it boots, MILO uncompresses itself into the correct place in
physical memory.   When it passes control to the Linux kernel,
it reserves memory for the compressed version of itself, the PALcode
(which the kernel needs) and some data structures.
This leaves <Literal remap="tt">most</Literal> of the memory in the system for Linux itself.
</Para>

<Para>
The final act of the memory code is to set up and turn on virtual addressing
so that the data structures that Linux expects to see are at the correct place
in virtual memory.
</Para>

<Para>
MILO contains video code that initialises and uses the video device
for the system.   
It will detect and use a VGA device if there is one, otherwise
it will try to use a TGA (21030) video device.   
Failing that, it will assume that there is no graphics device.
The BIOS emulation that the standard, pre-built, images include is
Digital's own BIOS emulation which supports most, if not all, of
the standard graphics devices available.
</Para>

<Para>
Linux device drivers live within the kernel and expect 
certain services from the kernel.  Some of these services are provided directly
by Linux kernel code, for example the interrupt handling and some is provided
by kernel look-alike routines.
</Para>

<Para>
MILO's most powerful
feature is that you can embed unaltered Linux device drivers into it.
This gives it the potential to support every device that Linux does.
MILO includes all of the block devices that are configured into the
Linux kernel that it is built against as well as a lot of the block device
code (for example, ll&lowbar;rw&lowbar;blk()).
</Para>

<Para>
MILO loads the Linux kernel from real file systems rather 
than  from boot blocks and other strange places.
It understands MSDOS, EXT2 and ISO9660 filesystems.
Gzip'd files are supported and these are recommended, particularly if
you are loading from floppy which is rather slow.
MILO recognises these by their <Emphasis>.gz</Emphasis> suffix.
</Para>

<Para>
Built into MILO is a simple keyboard driver which, together with
an equally simple video driver allows it to have a simple user interface.
That interface allows you to list file systems on configured devices, boot
Linux or run flash update utilities and set environment variables that 
control the system's booting.
Like LILO, you can pass arguments to the Kernel.
</Para>

<Para>
MILO must tell the Linux kernel what sort of system this is,
how much memory there is and which of that memory is free.
It does this using the HWRPB (Hardware Restart Parameter Block) data 
structure and associated memory cluster descriptions.
These are placed at the appropriate place in virtual memory just before
control is passed to the Linux kernel.
</Para>

<Sect1 id="build-section">
<Title>How To Build MILO </Title>

<Para>
 You build MILO 
seperately from the Kernel.  As MILO requires parts of the kernel
to function (for example interrupt handling) you must first 
configure and build the
kernel that matches with MILO that you want to build.  Mostly this
means building the kernel with the same version number.  
So, MILO-2.0.25.tar.gz will build against linux-2.0.25.tar.gz.  
MILO <Literal remap="tt">may</Literal> build against a higher version of the kernel, but there 
again it may not.
Also, now that ELF shared libraries are fully supported, there are two
versions of the MILO sources.
To build under an ELF system you must first unpack the standard MILO sources
and then patch those sources with the same version numbered ELF patch.
In the remainder of this discussion,
I assume that your kernel sources and object files are stored in the
subtree at <Literal remap="tt">/usr/src/linux</Literal> and that the linux kernel has been fully
built with the command <Literal remap="tt">make boot</Literal>
</Para>

<Para>
To build MILO, 
change your working directory to the MILO source directory and
invoke <Literal remap="tt">make</Literal> with:

<Screen>
$    make KSRC=/usr/src/linux config
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
Just like the Linux kernel, you will be asked a series of questions
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
     Echo output to the serial port (MINI_SERIAL_ECHO) [y]
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
 It's a good idea to echo kernel printk to <Literal remap="tt">/dev/ttyS0</Literal> if you can.
If you can (and want to), then type "y", otherwise "n".  
All of the standard, pre-built, MILO images include serial port I/O using COM1.
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
     Use Digital's BIOS emulation code (not free) (MINI_DIGITAL_BIOS_EMU) [y]
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
 This code is included as a library which is freely distributable
so long as it is used on an Alpha based system.  The sources are
not available.   If you answer <Literal remap="tt">n</Literal> then the freeware 
alternative BIOS emulation will be built.  It's sources are included
with MILO.
Note that you cannot right now build choose Digital's BIOS emulation code in
an ELF system (the library is not yet ready) and so you must answer no to this
question.
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
     Build PALcode from sources (Warning this is dangerous) (MINI_BUILD_PALCODE_FROM_SOURCES) [n]     
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
You should only do this if you have changed the PALcode sources, otherwise use the standard,
pre-built PALcode included with MILO.
</Para>

<Para>
You are now all set to build the MILO image itself:

<Screen>
$    make KSRC=/usr/src/linux
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
When the build has successfully completed, the MILO image is in the file called <Literal remap="tt">milo</Literal>.
There are a lot of images called <Literal remap="tt">milo.*</Literal>, these should be ignored.
</Para>

<Title>How To Load MILO</Title>

<Para>
The most commonly supported method of loading MILO is from the Windows NT
ARC firmware as most shipping systems support this.  However, there are
a wide variety of  loading MILO.   It may be loaded from:

</Para>

<Sect2 id="arc-section">
<Title>Loading MILO from the Windows NT ARC firmware</Title>

<Para>
Most, if not all, Alpha AXP based systems include the Windows NT
ARC firmware and this is the prefered method of booting MILO and thus
Linux.  Once the Windows NT firmware is running and you have the correct
MILO image for your system, this method is completely generic.
</Para>

<Para>
The Windows NT ARC firmware is an environment in which programs can run
and make callbacks into the firmware to perform actions.  The Windows NT
OSLoader is a program that does exactly this.   Linload.exe is a 
much simpler program which does just enough to load and execute MILO.
It loads the appropriate image
file into memory at 0x00000000 and then makes a swap-PAL PALcall to
it.  
MILO, like Linux, uses a different PALcode to Windows NT which is why the
swap has to happen.
MILO relocates itself to 0x200000 and continues on through the
PALcode reset entry point as before.
</Para>

<Para>
Before you add a Linux boot option, 
you will need to copy linload.exe and the appropriate MILO that you
wish to load to someplace that the Windows NT ARC firmware can read from.  
In the following example, I assume that you are booting from a DOS format floppy
disk:
</Para>

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 Use the down arrow to get <Literal remap="tt">"OSLOADFILENAME"</Literal> up and then type in the
name of the MILO image that you wish to use, for example <Literal remap="tt">"noname.arc"</Literal>
followed by return.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 ESC will get you back to the <Literal remap="tt">"Boot menu"</Literal> and you can attempt to boot
MILO.  If you do not want Linux as the first boot option, then you can
alter the order of the boot options in the <Literal remap="tt">"Boot selections menu"</Literal>.
</Para>
</ListItem>

</OrderedList>

</Para>

<Para>
At the end of all this, you should have a boot selection that looks something 
like:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
LOADIDENTIFIER=Linux

</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
You can now boot MILO (and then Linux).  You can load linload.exe
and MILO directly from a file system that Windows NT understands such as 
NTFS or DOS on a hard disk.
</Para>

<Para>
The contents <Literal remap="tt">OSLOADOPTIONS</Literal> are passed to MILO which interprets
it as a command.   So, in order to
boot Linux directly from Windows NT without pausing in MILO, you could
pass the following in <Literal remap="tt">OSLOADOPTIONS</Literal>:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
boot sda2:vmlinux.gz root=/dev/sda2
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
See <XRef LinkEnd="MILO-if-section"> for more
information on the commands available.
</Para>

<Para>
Another (rather sneaky) way of loading of loading MILO via the WNT ARC firmware
is to put MILO onto an MS-DOS floppy and call it <Literal remap="tt">fwupdate.exe</Literal> and then choose
the "Upgrade Firmware" option.

<Title>Loading MILO from the Evaluation Board Debug Monitor</Title>

<Para>
Evaluation boards (and often designs cloned from them) include
support for the Alpha Evaluation Board Debug Monitor.   Consult
your system document before considering this method of booting
MILO.   The following systems are <Emphasis>known</Emphasis> to include Debug Monitor

Before you consider this method, you should note that the early
versions of the Evaluation Board Debug Monitor did not include video
or keyboard drivers and so you must be prepared to connect another
system via the serial port so that you can use the Debug Monitor.
Its interface is very simple and typing help shows a whole heap
of commands.  The ones that are most interesting include
the word <Literal remap="tt">boot</Literal> or <Literal remap="tt">load</Literal> in them.
</Para>

<Para>
The Evaluation Board Debug Monitor can load an image either via the network
(netboot) or via a floppy (flboot).  In either case, set the boot
address to 0x200000 (<Literal remap="tt">&#62; bootadr 200000</Literal>) before booting the
image.  
</Para>

<Para>
If the image is on floppy (and note that only DOS formatted floppies
are supported), then you will need to type the following command:
</Para>

If you do not have a standard pre-built MILO .dd image,

<Title>Loading MILO from the SRM Console</Title>

<Para>
The SRM (short for System Reference Manual) Console knows nothing about filesystems or disk-partitions, 
it simply expects that the secondary bootstrap loader occupies a consecutive range of
physical disk sectors starting from a given offset.   The information describing
the secondary bootstrap loader (its size and offset) is given in the first 512 
byte block.   To load MILO via the SRM you must generate that structure on a 
device which the SRM can access (such as a floppy disk).
This is what <Literal remap="tt">mboot</Literal> and <Literal remap="tt">bootm</Literal>, <Literal remap="tt">mboot</Literal> is the first block (or
boot description) and <Literal remap="tt">mboot</Literal> is the <Literal remap="tt">MILO</Literal> image rounded up to a
512 byte boundary.
</Para>

<Para>
  To load MILO from a boot block device, either build <Literal remap="tt">mboot</Literal>
and <Literal remap="tt">bootm</Literal> and push them onto the boot device
using the following command:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
	$ cat mboot bootm &#62; /dev/fd0
</Screen>

</Para>

Or, grab the appropriate <Literal remap="tt">MILO.dd</Literal> from a web site and write it onto the
boot device using either <Literal remap="tt">RAWRITE.EXE</Literal> or <Literal remap="tt">dd</Literal>.
</Para>

<Para>
 Once you have done that you can boot the SRM console and use one of its
many commands to boot MILO.   For example, to boot MILO from a boot block floppy
you would use the following command:

<Title>AxpPCI33 (Noname)</Title>

<Para>
The Noname board can load MILO 
from the Windows NT ARC firmware
(Section <XRef LinkEnd="arc-section">),
from the SRM Console
(Section <XRef LinkEnd="srm-section">).
and from a failsafe boot block floppy
(Section <XRef LinkEnd="bootblock-section">).
A flash management utility, runnable from MILO is available so that
once MILO is running, it can be blown into flash
(Section <XRef LinkEnd="MILO-fmu-section">).
However, be warned
that once you have done this you will lose the previous image held there
as there is only room for one image.
</Para>

<Para>
The way that Noname boots is controlled
by a set of jumpers on the board, J29 and J28.  These look like:

<Screen>
        	    4
        J29	2 x x x 6
        	1 x x x 5

        J28	2 x x x 6
        	1 x x x 5
        	    3
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
The two options that we're interested in are J28, pins 1-3 which
boots the console/loader from flash and J29, pins 1-3 which boots the
console/loader from a boot block floppy.  The second option is the one
that you need to first boot MILO on the Noname board.
</Para>

<Para>
Once you've selected the boot from floppy option via the jumpers,
put the SRM boot block floppy containing MILO into the
floppy and reboot.  In a few seconds (after the floppy light goes out)
you should see the screen blank to white and MILO telling
you what's going on.
</Para>

<Para>
If you are really interested in technical stuff, the Noname loads
images off of the floppy into physical address 0x104000 and images
from flash into 0x100000.  For this reason, MILO is built
with it's PALcode starting at 0x200000.  When it is first loaded, it
moves itself to the correct location (see relocate.S).
</Para>

</Sect3>

<Sect3 id="pc64-section">
<Title>AlphaPC64 (Cabriolet)</Title>

<Para>
The AlphaPC64 includes the Windows NT ARC firmware
(Section <XRef LinkEnd="arc-section">),
the SRM Console (Section <XRef LinkEnd="srm-section">)
and the Evaluation Debug Monitor 
(Section <XRef LinkEnd="dbm-section">).
These images are in flash and there is room to add MILO so that
you can boot MILO directly from flash.
A flash management utility, runnable from MILO is available so that
once MILO is running, it can be blown into flash
(Section <XRef LinkEnd="MILO-fmu-section">).
This system supports MILO environment variables.
</Para>

<Para>
You select between the boot options (and MILO when it is
been put into flash) using a combination of jumpers and a boot option which
is saved in the NVRAM of the TOY clock.
</Para>

<Para>
The jumper is J2, SP bits 6 and 7 have the following meanings:

<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>

<Para>
SP bit 6 should always be out.  If this jumper is set then the
SROM mini-debugger gets booted,
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
SP bit 7 in is boot image selected by the boot option byte in 
the TOY clock,

<ListItem>

<Para>
SP bit 7 out is boot first image in flash.
</Para>
</ListItem>

</ItemizedList>

</Para>

<Para>
So, with bit 7 out, the Debug Monitor will be booted as it is <Literal remap="tt">always</Literal>
the first image in flash.  With bit 7 in, the image selected by
the boot option in the TOY clock will be selected.  
The Debug Monitor, the Windows NT ARC firmware and MILO all support setting
this boot option byte but you must be very careful using it.
In particular, you cannot set the boot option so that next time the system
boots MILO when you are running the Windows NT ARC firmware, it only
allows you to set Debug Monitor or Windows NT ARC as boot options.
</Para>

<Para>
 To get MILO into flash via the Evaluation Board Debug Monitor, 
you will need a flashable image.
The build proceedures make MILO.rom, 
but you can also make a rom image using the makerom tool in the 
Debug Monitor software that comes with the board:
</Para>

<Para>
    &#62; makerom -v -i7 -l200000 MILO -o mini.flash
</Para>

<Para>
 (type makerom to find out what the arguments mean, but 7 is a
flash image id used by the srom and -l200000 gives the load address
for the image as 0x200000).
</Para>

<Para>
Load that image into memory (via the Debug Monitor commands flload,
netload, and so on) at 0x200000 and then blow the image into flash:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
     AlphaPC64&#62; flash 200000 8
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
 (200000 is where the image to be blown is in memory and 8 is the segment
number where you put the image.   There are 16 1024*64 byte segments in the
flash and the Debug Monitor is at seg 0 and the Windows NT ARC firmware is at seg 4).
</Para>

<Para>
 Set up the image that the srom will boot by writing the number of
the image into the TOY clock.
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
     AlphaPC64&#62; bootopt 131

 Power off, put jumper 7 on and power on and you should see the
MILO burst into life.  If you don't then take jumper 7 back off

its own set of environment variables that do not change from boot to boot.
These variables are:
</Para>

<Title>Booting Linux </Title>

<Para>
The <Literal remap="tt">boot</Literal> command boots a linux kernel from a device.
You will need to have a linux kernel image on
an EXT2 formated disk (SCSI, IDE or floppy) or an ISO9660 formatted CD 
available to MILO.  
The image can be gzip'd and in this case 
MILO will recognise that it is gzip'd by the .gz suffix.
</Para>

<Para>
You should note that the version of MILO does not usually have to match
the version of the Linux kernel that you are loading.
You boot Linux using the following command syntax:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
     MILO&#62; boot [-t file-system] device-name:file-name [[boot-option] [boot-option] ...]

If you are installing Red Hat, then you will need to specify a root

 MILO will automatically contain the block devices that
you configure into your vmlinux.  I have tested the floppy driver, the IDE
driver and a number of SCSI drivers (for example, the NCR 810), and these work fine.  
Also, it is important to set the host id of the SCSI controller
to a reasonable value.  By default, MILO will initialize it to the
highest possible value (7) which should normally work just fine.
However, if you wish, you can explicitly set the host id of the
<Emphasis>n</Emphasis>-th SCSI controller in the system by setting environment
variable <Literal remap="tt">SCSI</Literal><Emphasis>n</Emphasis><Literal remap="tt">&lowbar;HOSTID</Literal> to the appropriate
value.  For example, to set the hostid of the first SCSI controller to
7, you can issue the following command at the MILO prompt:

<Title>Rebooting Linux </Title>

<Para>
You may want to reboot a running Linux system using the
<Literal remap="tt">shutdown -r now</Literal> command.  In this case, the Linux kernel
returns control to MILO (via the HALT CallPAL entrypoint).
MILO leaves a compressed copy of itself in memory for just this
reason and detects that the system is being rebooted from information
held in the HWRPB (Hardware Restart Parameter Block).
In this case it starts to reboot using exactly the same command that
was used to boot the Linux kernel the last time.
There is a 30 second timeout that allows you to interrupt this

<Title>The ''program'' command</Title>

<Para>
The flash management utility contains a compressed copy of a flash
image of MILO.  The ''program'' command allows you to blow this image
into flash.
The command allows you to back out, but before you run it you should
use the ''list'' command to see where to put MILO.  
If MILO is already in flash, then the flash management utility will 
offer to overwrite it.

<Title>Restrictions.</Title>

<Para>
Unfortunately this is not a perfect world and there, as always, some
restrictions that you should be aware of.
</Para>

<Para>
MILO is not meant to load operating systems other than Linux, 
although it can load images linked to run at the same place in memory as Linux
(which is 0xFFFFFC0000310000).
This is how the flash management utilities can be run.
</Para>

<Para>
 The PALcode sources included in <Literal remap="tt">miniboot/palcode/</Literal><Emphasis>blah</Emphasis> are
correct, however there are problems when they are built using the
latest <Literal remap="tt">gas</Literal>.  They <Emphasis>do</Emphasis> build if you use the ancient a.out gas
that's supplied in the Alpha Evaluation Board toolset (and that's how
they were built).  I'm trying to get someone to fix the new gas.
Meanwhile, as a workaround, I have provided pre-built PALcode for the
supported boards and David Mosberger-Tang has a fixed gas on
his ftp site.

<Title>Problem Solving.</Title>

<Para>
Here are some common problems that people have seen, together with the
solutions.
</Para>

<Para>
<Emphasis remap="bf">Reading MS-DOS floppies from the Evaluation Board Debug Monitor.</Emphasis>  
</Para>

<Para>
 Some of the older versions of the Evaluation Board Debug Monitor (pre-version 2.0)
have a problem with DOS format flopies generated from Linux.
Usually, the Debug Monitor can load the first few sectors all right, but then goes
into an endless loop complaining about "bad sectors."  Apparently,
there is an incompatibility between the DOS file system as expected by
the Debug Monitor and the Linux implementation of DOSFS.  To make the
long story short: if you run into this problem, try using DOS to write
the floppy disk.  For example, if loading the file <Literal remap="tt">MILO.cab</Literal>
doesn't work, use a DOS machine, insert the floppy and then do:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
     copy a:MILO.cab c:
     copy c:MILO.cab a:
     del c:MILO.cab
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
 Then try booting from that floppy again.  This normally solves the problem.
</Para>

<Para>
<Emphasis remap="bf">MILO displays a long sequence of <Literal remap="tt">O&#62;</Literal> and does not accept input.</Emphasis>
</Para>

<Para>
This usually happens when MILO was built to use COM1 as a secondary console
device.   In such a case, MILO echo output to COM1 and accepts input from
there also.   This is great for debugging but not so great if you have
a device other than a terminal connected.
If this happens, disconnect the device or power it down until the Linux
kernel has booted.
Once Linux is up and running, everything will work as expected.
</Para>

<Para>
<Emphasis remap="bf">MILO complains that the kernel image has the wrong magic number</Emphasis>
</Para>

<Para>
 Older versions of MILO did not support the ELF object file format and so
could not recognise an ELF image and this might be your problem.
If this is reported, upgrade to the latest MILO that you can find.  All
2.0.20 and beyond MILOs support ELF.
On the other hand it could be that the image is indeed damaged.  You should
also note that MILO does not yet automatically distinquish between GZIP'd
and non-GZIP'd images; you need to add the ".gz" suffix to the file name.
</Para>

<Para>
<Emphasis remap="bf">MILO prints "...turning on virtual addressing and jumping to the Linux Kernel" and
nothing else happens</Emphasis>
</Para>

<Para>
One obvious problem is that the kernel image is wrongly built or is built for another
Alpha system altogether.
Another is that the video board is a TGA (Zlxp) device and the kernel has been built
for a VGA device (or vice versa).
It is worth building the kernel to echo to COM1 and then connecting a terminal to
that serial port or retrying the kernel that came with the Linux distribution that you
installed.
</Para>

<Para>
<Emphasis remap="bf">MILO does not recognise the SCSI device</Emphasis>
</Para>

<Para>
The standard MILO images include as many device drivers as are known to be stable
for Alpha (as of now that includes the NCR 810, QLOGIC ISP, Buslogic and Adaptec 2940s
and 3940 cards).  If your card is not included, it may be that the driver is not stable
enough on an Alpha system yet.  Again, the latest MILO images are worth trying.  You
can tell which SCSI devices a MILO image has built into it by using the "show" command.
</Para>

<Para>
<Emphasis remap="bf">MILO is unable to read your ext2 filesystem</Emphasis>
</Para>

<Para>
Early versions of MILO are unable to read ext2 filesystems that have been created with
the newer versions of mke2fs due to sparse superblocks. Upgrade to a newer MILO and this
should fix the problem.
