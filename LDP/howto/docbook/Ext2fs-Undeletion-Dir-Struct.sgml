      <para>
        This document is supposed to be as an complementary to the
        <emphasis>Ext2fs-Undeletion mini-HOWTO</emphasis> written by
        Aaron Crane. I really recommend you to carefully study that one before
        reading this.
      </para>

      <para>
        Here I will describe a straight forward way of recovering whole
        directory structures, instead of file by file, that have been removed
        by a misplaced <emphasis>rm -rf</emphasis>.

      <title>Background</title>

      <para>
        This text has been written while solving my own undeletion problems that
        I had some time ago. I was about to move some directories from one disk
        to another. The problem was that the extra disk went corrupted directly
        after the move for some reason.
      </para>

      <para>
        So I wanted to get the moved directories back from my original disk.
        There were totally about 40000 files to recover and I did not feel very
        much like to search and rename each one of them by hand.
      </para>

      <para>
        I wanted to get back the whole structure of directories. The same
        situation would have appeared if I had made an
        <emphasis>rm -rf</emphasis> to those directories.
      </para>

    </sect2>




  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="precond">
    <title>Preconditions</title>

    <para>
      It is really important that you unmount the affected partition immediately
      before doing anything else with it. If you have copied around some files
      in this partition after the accident, then the chance for this method to
      work has lowered a lot.
    </para>

    <para>
      Also you must have a quite new kernel, because the
      2.0.x and below zeroes indirect blocks, which will
      not make this process to work for files with more than 12 blocks of data.
    </para>

    <para>
      I will describe one method of recovery and I will not leave out much for
      error handling. If you suspect that some step described below went wrong,
      I do not recommend you to go any further.
    </para>

  </sect1>




  <sect1 id="prep">
    <title>Preparation</title>

    <para>
      Unmount the partition where you got your deleted files at. I will denote
      that partition with /dev/hdx1.
    </para>

    <para>
      <programlisting>
        # umount /dev/hdx1</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
      Check the size in blocks of /dev/hdx1.
    </para>

    <para>
      <programlisting>
        # fdisk -l /dev/hdx</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
      Now you need to have an extra partition of the same size as
      /dev/hdx1, to be able to act safely. Suppose that you
      have an empty harddrive located at /dev/hdy.
    </para>

    <para>
      <programlisting>
        # fdisk /dev/hdy</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
      Create a partition with the same size as /dev/hdx1.
      Here <emphasis>size</emphasis> is the size in blocks (each block is
      1024 kB) of /dev/hdx1 taken from above.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        I am using <emphasis>fdisk</emphasis> version 2.10f
        and if you have another version the <emphasis>fdisk</emphasis>
        interaction below may not be the same.
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      <programlisting>
        fdisk: n      &#60;- Add a new partition.
        fdisk: p      &#60;- Primary partition.
        fdisk:        &#60;- Just press return to chose the default first cylinder.
        fdisk: +sizeK &#60;- Make a partition of the same size as /dev/hdx1.
        fdisk: w      &#60;- Write table to disk and exit.</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
      Now copy the content of the original partition to that extra one.
    </para>

    <para>
      <programlisting>
        # dd if=/dev/hdx1 of=/dev/hdy1 bs=1k</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
      This process may take quite a long time dependent of how big the partition
      is. You can get the job done faster by increasing the blocksize,
      <emphasis>bs</emphasis>, but then you need to get the division of the
      partition by <emphasis>bs</emphasis> to have a remainder of zero.
    </para>

    <para>
      From now on we will only work with that copy of the source partition to
      be able to step back if something goes wrong.
    </para>

      If a filename is renamed to a shorter one, then the third field will be

    <para>
      The first entry you will see is the directory itself, represented by a

    <para>
      Suppose that we have the following directory entry.
    </para>

    <para>
      <programlisting>
         c1 02 0e 00 40 00 05 01 'u' 't' 'i' 'l' 's'</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
      Then the inode would be e02c1 in hexadecimal representation or 918209 in
      decimal. The next entry would be located after 64 bytes (40 in hex). We
      see that the filename consist of 5 bytes ("utils") and the file type (01)
      is a regular file.
    </para>

    <para>
      Now recalculate the directories inode numbers in decimal representation.
    </para>

    <para>
      If you do not like to calculate this by hand I have made a small program
      in C that will do this for you. The program takes as input a directory
      dump (created by <emphasis>debugfs</emphasis> as described in
      <xref linkend="find">). The output (at stdout) consist of each entrys
      inode number and filename.
    </para>

    <para>
      Before you run the program you need to load the dump into a hexeditor and
      change the <emphasis>directory entry length</emphasis> field at the entry
      before the one you want to get back. But it is simple. If we name the
      field before to <emphasis>x</emphasis> and the field at the entry you want
      to get back to <emphasis>y</emphasis>. Then change <emphasis>x</emphasis>
      to <emphasis>x - y</emphasis>.
    </para>

    <para>
      The program called <emphasis>e2dirana</emphasis> (ext2fs directory

  <sect1 id="locate">
    <title>Locating deleted inodes</title>

    <para>
      Get a list of all deleted inodes.
    </para>

    <para>
      <programlisting>
        # echo lsdel | debugfs /dev/hdy1 &#62; lsdel.out</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
      One problem here is that <emphasis>debugfs</emphasis> will not give the
      inode numbers to files that are zero in size (you probably have some in
      your /etc directory for instance). I will tell how to solve this problem
      in <xref linkend="recalc"> and <xref linkend="final">.
    </para>

    <para>
      Load "lsdel.out" into a texteditor. The list of inodes should be sorted in
      time. Try to remember exactly what time you did that
      <emphasis>rm -rf</emphasis>. Probably it was the the last items you
      deleted and then they will be located at the bottom of the list, because it
      is sorted in time. Delete all lines that has nothing of interest. Save as
      "lsdel.out-selected".
    </para>

    <para>
      Now we will cut away everything except the inodes.
    </para>

    <para>
      <programlisting>
        # cut -b 1-8 lsdel.out-selected | tr -d " " &#62; inodes</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
      To be sure, check that the deleted directories found above have their
      inodes in the list.
    </para>

    <para>
      <programlisting>
        # grep ^inode$ inodes</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
      Where <emphasis>inode</emphasis> is the corresponding inode number.
    </para>

  </sect1>




  <sect1 id="activate">
    <title>Activating inodes</title>

    <para>
      Now it is time for changing some flags of the deleted inodes.
    </para>

    <para>
      Copy the following 6 lines into a file named "make-debugfs-input".
    </para>

    <para>
      <programlisting>
        #!/bin/sh
        awk '{ print "mi &#60;" $1 "&#62;\n"\
                     "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"\
                     "0\n"\
                     "1\n"\

    </para>

    <para>
      This will simulate the user input when editing the inodes manually.
      We will set <emphasis>deletion time</emphasis> to 0
      and <emphasis>link count</emphasis> to 1.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        I am using <emphasis>debugfs</emphasis> version 1.18 and if you have
        another version you should check if you need to adjust the number of
        returns above.
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      Now change the inodes.
    </para>

    <para>
      <programlisting>
        # ./make-debugfs-input &#60; inodes | debugfs -w /dev/hdy1 | tail -c 40</programlisting>

    <para>
      After you have added the links you will notice that the directories have
      popped up in the current directory. You can now list their contents (from
      <emphasis>debugfs</emphasis>).
    </para>

    <para>
      But the size shown for each directory is zero and that need to be fixed,
      otherwise they will look empty with <emphasis>ls</emphasis> from the

    <title>If /lost+found not empty</title>

    <para>
      Some of the directory and files may not pop-up at their right places.
      Instead they will be located in /lost+found with names after their inode
      numbers.
    </para>

    <para>
      In this case the pointer at the ".." directory entry probably have been
      increased and will point to one of the later entrys in the directory (of
      some reason I do not know, maybe it is a fs bug).
    </para>

    <para>
      Examine <emphasis>pass 3</emphasis> (where directory connectivity is
      checked) of "e2fsck.out". There you will find which directories that are
      affected. Dump those to disk (as described in <xref linkend="find">).
    </para>

    <para>
      Run
      <ulink url="http://www.matematik.su.se/~tomase/ext2fs-undeletion/">
      <emphasis>e2dirana</emphasis></ulink>
      both with and without the <emphasis>p</emphasis> parameter (it changes the
      pointer at the ".." directory entry). Here <emphasis>dump</emphasis> is
      the dumped directory.
    </para>

    <para>
      <programlisting>
        # e2dirana dump &#62; dump1
        # e2dirana -p dump &#62; dump2</programlisting>

      Compare the outputs.

    <para>
      If they are not the same there are missing files in that directory. Then
      move those files from /lost+found to their right place. Here
      <emphasis>dest</emphasis> is a symbolic link to the destination directory.
      Put the output in a script and run it if you agree.
    </para>

    <para>
      <programlisting>
        # diff dump1 dump2 |\
          tail -n $[`diff dump1 dump2 | wc -l`-1] | cut -b 3- |\
          sed -e 's/^\([^ ]*\) \(.*\)$/mv lost+found\/#\1 dest\/"\2"/' |\

  <sect1 id="final">
    <title>Final touch</title>

    <para>
      If in <xref linkend="recalc"> you choosed to get files with the size of
      zero back you now have a problem, because those files has a non-zero
      deletion time and their link count is zero. That means that every time
      <emphasis>e2fsck</emphasis> is running it will prompt to remove (clear)
      those files.
    </para>

    <para>
      The easy way to solve this is to copy the whole directory structure to
      another place (it can be the same partition) and then delete the old
      directory structure. Otherwise you will have to locate those inodes and
      change them with <emphasis>debugfs</emphasis>.
    </para>

    <para>
      Now if everything have went well, things should have been restored to its
      original state before deletion. At least it did for me and in those tests
      I have made while writing this. Be sure that you have brought up to the
      preconditions described in <xref linkend="precond">.
