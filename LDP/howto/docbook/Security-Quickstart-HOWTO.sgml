 Who should be reading this document and why should the average Linux user

 should be reading. <Quote>Security</Quote> is a broad subject with many
 facets, and is covered in much more depth in other documents, books, and on
 various sites on the Web. This document is intended to be an introduction to
 the most basic concepts as they relate to <![%redhat;[Red Hat]]> Linux, and as
 a starting point only.

</Para>

<para>
 The above is real, live data from a one week period for my home LAN.
 Much of the above would seem to be specifically targeted at Linux systems.
 Many of the targeted <quote>destination</quote> ports are used by well known
 Linux and Unix services, and all may be installed, and possibly
 even running, on your system. 
</para>
 
<para>
 The focus here will be on threats that are shared by all Linux users, whether
 a dual boot home user, or large commercial site. And we will take a few,
 relatively quick and easy steps that will make a typical home Desktop system
 or small office system running <![%redhat;[Red Hat]]> Linux reasonably safe
 from the majority of outside threats. For those responsible for Linux systems
 in a larger or more complex environment, you'd be well advised to read this,
 and then follow up with additional reading suitable to your particular
 situation. Actually, this is probably good advice for everybody.

</para>

<para>
 We will assume the reader knows little about Linux, networking, TCP/IP, 
 and the finer points of running a server Operating System like Linux. We 
 will also assume, for the sake of this document, that all local users are
 <quote>trusted</quote> users, and won't address physical or local network
 security issues in any detail. Again, if this is not the case, further
 reading is strongly recommended. 
 
</para>

<para>
 The principles that will guide us in our quest are:

</para>

<para>
 <itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
   <para>
     There is no <application>magic bullet</application>. There is no one 
     <emphasis role="bold">single</emphasis> thing we can do to make us secure. It is not that simple. 
   </para>
  </listitem> 

  <listitem>
   <para>
    Security is a process that requires maintenance, not an objective to
    be reached.
   </para>
  </listitem> 

  <listitem>
   <para>
     There is no 100% safe program, package or distribution. Just varying 
     degrees of insecurity. 
   </para>
  </listitem> 

 </itemizedlist>
</para>


<para>
 The steps we will be taking to get there are:
</para>

<para>
 <itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
   <para>
    Step 1: Turn off, and perhaps uninstall, any and all unnecessary services.
   </para>
  </listitem> 

  <listitem>
   <para>
    Step 2: Make sure that any services that are installed are updated and
    patched to the current, safe version -- <emphasis>and then stay that
    way</emphasis>. Every server application has potential exploits. Some have
    just not been found yet.
   </para>
  </listitem> 

  <listitem>
   <para>
    Step 3: Limit connections to us from outside sources by implementing a
    firewall and/or other restrictive policies. The goal is to allow only the
    minimum traffic necessary for whatever our individual situation may be.
   </para>
  </listitem> 

  <listitem>
   <para>
     Awareness. Know your system, and how to properly maintain and secure it.
     New vulnerabilities are found, and exploited, all the time. Today's
     secure system may have tomorrow's as yet unfound weaknesses. 
     
   </para>
  </listitem> 

 </itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
 If you don't have time to read everything, concentrate on Steps 1, 2, and 3. 
 This is where the meat of the subject matter is. The <link
 linkend="appendix">Appendix</link> has a lot of supporting information, which
 may be helpful, but may not be necessary for all readers.

<title>Notes</title>
<para>
 This is a Red Hat specific version of this document. The included examples 
 are compatible with Red Hat 7.0 and later. Actually, most examples should 
 work with earlier versions of Red Hat as well. Also, this document should be
 applicable to other distributions that are Red Hat derivatives, such as
 Mandrake, Conectiva, etc.

</para>

<para>
 Overwhelmingly, the content of this document is not peculiar to Red Hat. The
 same rules and methodologies apply to other Linuxes. And indeed, to other
 Operating Systems as well. But each may have their own way of doing things -- 
 the file names and locations may differ, as may the system utilities that 
 we rely on. It is these differences that make this document a 
 <quote>Red Hat</quote> version.

<sect1 id="foreword">
<title>Foreword</title>

<para>
 Before getting into specifics, let's try to briefly answer some questions
 about why we need to be concerned about security in the first place. 

</para>

<para>
 It is easy to see why an e-commerce site, an on-line bank, or a government 
 agency with sensitive documents would be concerned about security. But what
 about the average user? Why should even a Linux home Desktop user worry about
 security? 

</para>

<para>
 Anyone connected to the Internet is a target, plain and simple. It
 makes little difference whether you have a part-time dialup connection, or a
 full-time connection, though full-time connections make for bigger targets.
 Larger sites make for bigger targets too, but this does not let small users
 off the hook since the <quote>small user</quote> may be less skilled and thus
 an easier victim. 
 <![%redhat;[ Red Hat, and Red Hat based distributions, tend to make for bigger 
  targets as well, since the installed user base is so large.]]>

</para>

<para>
 There are those out there that are scanning just for easy
 victims all the time. If you start logging unwanted connection attempts, 
 you will see this soon enough. There is little doubt that many of these
 attempts are maliciously motivated and the attacker, in some cases, is
 looking for Linux boxes to crack. Does someone on the other side of the globe
 really want to borrow my printer? 

</para>

<para>
 What do they want? Often, they just may want your computer, your IP
 address, and your bandwidth. Then they use you to either attack others, or
 possibly commit crimes or mischief and are hiding their true identity behind
 you. This is an all too common scenario. Commercial and high-profile sites
 are targeted more directly and have bigger worries, but we all face this type
 of common threat. 

</para>

<para>
 With a few reasonable precautions, <![%redhat;[Red Hat ]]>Linux can be very
 secure, and with all the available tools, makes for a fantastically fun and
 powerful Internet connection or server. Most successful break-ins are the
 result of ignorance or carelessness. 

</para>

<para>
 The bottom line is:

</para>

<para>
 <itemizedlist>
  
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Do you want control of your own system or not?
   </para>
  </listitem> 

  <listitem>
   <para>
    Do you want to unwittingly participate in criminal activity?
   </para>
  </listitem> 

  <listitem>
   <para>
    Do you want to be used by someone else?
   </para>
  </listitem> 

  <listitem>
   <para>
     Do you want to risk losing your Internet connection?
   </para>

    Do you want to have to go through the time consuming steps of reclaiming
    your system?
   </para>

  <listitem>
   <para>
    Do you want to chance the loss of data on your system?
   </para>
  </listitem> 

 </itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
 These are all real possibilities, unless we take the appropriate
 precautions.

</para>

<Warning>
 <Para>
  If you are reading this because you have already been broken into, or
  suspect that you have, you cannot trust any of your system utilities to
  provide reliable information. And the suggestions made in the next several
  sections will not help you recover your system. Please jump straight to the
  <link linkend="hacked">Have I been Hacked?</link> section, and read that
  first.
 
 </Para>
</Warning>



<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->
<!--
<sect2>
<title>Preamble</title>

<para>
 First, there is no such thing as a 100% guaranteed safe Internet connection. 
 No matter how many steps you take, there is always someone willing to do you 
 one better, and undo all your work. The only absolutely safe connection is
 one that is unplugged. That being said, it is not difficult to greatly
 minimize the risk from many of these inherent threats. 
</para>

<para>
 Secondly, networks are designed explicitly such that computers in different
 locations can connect to each other, and exchange data. Linux is a network
 Operating System from the ground up, and generally comes with a wide array
 of <Quote>server</Quote> applications installed and ready for action. Mail
 servers, web servers, ftp servers, telnet servers, print servers - to name
 just a few. While this is a good thing in many respects, it also makes Linux
 an inviting target for those with less than honorable intentions. A common
 modus operandi for <Quote>hackers</Quote> is to find a weakness in a given
 server (e.g. <application>ftp</application> server), and then let themselves
 in by exploiting that weakness. One step we will take here will be to decide
 which, if any, servers we really need to be running on our own systems. Then,
 we'll make sure that any we do really need to be running, are running the
 latest patched version. 

</para>

<para>
 Contrary to popular opinion, a <Quote>hacker</Quote> does not much
 care about any sensitive or personal data (like bank account number) you may
 have tucked away. Not to say this is not a concern for businesses, commercial
 sites and others with valuable secrets or data. But what he really wants in
 many cases is your IP address, your bandwidth, and the free reign of your
 system. That's all. This way he is hidden, and whatever attacks or mischief
 he may undertake, utilizes your resources, and it looks like it is coming
 from you. So if I wanted to break into CIA Headquarters, I surely wouldn't do
 it from home. Well, not my home anyway. First I break into someone else's
 system, and do it from their home. Anyway, you are a target just because you
 are connected to the Internet - nothing more, nothing less.
</para>

 Lastly, is every connection attempt, an attempted break-in? No, of course
 not. There is a number of innocent explanations why you might find someone 
 knocking at your door so to speak. But how to tell the difference? You can't 
 really, but we do know for a fact that many of these attempts are indeed
 either attempts to find out more about your system as a precursor to
 <quote>something</quote>, or possibly are an actual entry attempt. So better
 safe than sorry as they say.

<title>The Optimum Configuration</title>

<para>
 Ideally, we would want one computer as a dedicated firewall and router. This 
 would be a bare bones installation, with <emphasis>no</emphasis> servers
 running, and only the required services and components installed. The rest of
 our systems would connect via this dedicated router/firewall system. If we
 wanted publicly accessible servers (web, mail, etc), these would be in a
 <quote>DMZ</quote> (De-militarized Zone). The router/firewall allows
 connections from outside to whatever services are running in the DMZ by
 <quote>forwarding</quote> these requests, but it is segregated from the rest
 of the internal network (aka LAN) otherwise. This leaves the rest of the
 internal network in fairly secure isolation, and relative safety. The
 <quote>danger zone</quote> is confined to the DMZ. 
 
</para>

<para>
 But not everyone has the hardware to dedicate to this kind of installation.
 This would require a minimum of two computers. Or three, if you would be 
 running any publicly available servers (not a good idea initially). Or maybe
 you are just new to Linux, and don't know your way around well enough yet. So
 if we can't do the ideal installation, we will do the next best thing.

<title>Before We Start</title>

<para>
 Before we get to the actual configuration sections, a couple of notes. 
 
</para>

<para>
<![%linuxall;[  
 First, one of the interesting aspects of Linux, is the different
 distributions like Caldera, Red Hat, SuSE, and Debian. While these are all 
 <quote>Linux</quote>, and may share certain features, there is surely some
 differences as to what utilities they may install as defaults. Most Linux 
 distributions will write their own system configuration tools as well. And with
 Linux, there is always more than one way to skin a cat. But for the purposes
 of our discussion, we will have to use as generic set of tools as we can.
 Unfortunately, GUI tools don't lend themselves to this type of documentation. 
 We will be using text based, command line tools for the most part. If you 
 are familiar with your distribution's utilities, feel free to substitute
 those in appropriate places. And if not, you should learn them or suitable 
 alternatives.

 To get ready, what you will need for the configuration sections below:
</para>

<para>
 <ItemizedList> 
  
  <ListItem>
   <para>
    A text editor. There are many available. If you use a file manager 
    application <![%redhat;[ like <application>gmc</application> or 
    <application>nautilus</application>]]>, it probably has a built in editor.
    This will be fine. <command>pico</command> and <command>mcedit</command>
    are two relatively easy to use editors if you don't already have a
    favorite. There is a quick guide to <link linkend="text">Text
    editors</link> in the Appendix that might help you get started. It is
    always a good idea to make a back up copy, before editing system
    configuration files.
   
   </para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <para>
     For non-GUI editors and some of the commands, you will also need a
     terminal window opened. <command>xterm,</command>
     <command>rxvt,</command> and <command>gnome-terminal</command> all will
     work, as well as others.
    </para>
  </ListItem> 

<![%linuxall;[   
  <ListItem>
   <para>
    You should also be familiar with your distribution's method of stopping
    services from running on each boot. Also, how they install (and uninstall)
    packages (<command>rpm</command>, <command>deb</command>, etc). And where
    to find the updates for your release. This information is available in
    your release's documentation, or on your vendor's web site. 
   </para>
  </ListItem> 
 ]]>

 </ItemizedList>

<para>
 We'll be using a hypothetical system here for examples with the hostname
 <quote>bigcat</quote>. Bigcat is a Linux desktop with a fresh install of the

<title>Step 1: Which services do we really need?</title>

<para>
 In this section we will see which services are running on our freshly installed
 system, decide which we really need, and do away with the rest. If you are
 not familiar with how servers and TCP connections work, you may want to read
 the section on <link linkend="serversetc">servers and ports</link> in the
 Appendix first. If not familiar with the <command>netstat</command> utility,
 you may want to read a quick <link linkend="netstat">overview</link> of it
 beforehand. There is also a section in the Appendix on <link
 linkend="ports">ports</link>, and corresponding services. You may want to 
 look that over too.
</para>
<!--
<para>
 Historically many Linux distributions either enabled many unnecessary
 services, or perhaps just made it too easy to wind up with services running 
 that might be unnecessary, and even potentially dangerous. And sometimes it
 is not so obvious that these are indeed running. Or that they may be
 potentially security risks.
</para>

<para>
 Newer Linux releases seem to be more security conscious, making it less
 likely to have unnecessary services running. This is good. But we can't be
 sure unless we know how to verify this for ourselves.
</para>
-->
<para>
 Our goal is to turn off as many services as possible. If we can turn them 
 all off, or at least off to outside connections, so much the better. Some
 rules of thumb we will use to guide us:
</para>

<para>
 <itemizedlist>

 <listitem>
  <para>
   It is perfectly possible to have a fully functional Internet connection
   with no servers running that are accessible to outside connections. Not 
   only possible, but desirable in many cases. The principle here is that 
   you will never be successfully broken into via a port that is not opened 
   because no server is listening on it. No server == no port open == not
   vulnerable. At least to outside connections.
  </para>
 </listitem> 

 <listitem>
  <para>
   If you don't recognize a particular service, chances are good you don't 
   really need it. We will assume that and so we'll turn it off. This may 
   sound dangerous, but is a good rule of thumb to go by. 
  </para>
 </listitem> 

 <listitem>
  <para>
   Some services are just not intended to be run over the Internet -- even 
   if you decide it is something you really do need. We'll flag these
   as dangerous, and address these in later sections, should you decide 
   you do really need them, and there is no good alternative.

<![%linuxall;[ 
<para>
 Unfortunately, there is no such things as a standard Linux installation. The 
 wide variety of servers available, coupled with each particular distribution's 
 installation options, make providing a ready made list impossible. The best 
 that can be done is show you how to list all running services, and point you 
 in the right general direction.
</para>
 ]]>
<![%redhat;[ 
<para>
  Which services get installed and started will vary greatly depending on
  which version of Red Hat, and which installation options were chosen. 
  Earlier releases were very much prone to start many services and then let 
  the user figure out which ones were needed, and which ones weren't. Recent 
  versions are much more cautious. But this makes providing a ready made list 
  of likely services impossible. Not to worry, as we shouldn't trust what is 
  <emphasis>supposed</emphasis> to be running anyway. What we need to do 
  is list for ourselves all running services.

 <![%redhat;[ Red Hat 7.x and Mandrake 8.x and later users will have
 <literal>xinetd</literal> in place of <literal>inetd</literal>.]]> Note the
 first three columns are cropped above for readability. If your list is as
 long as the example, you have some work ahead of you! It is highly unlikely
 that you really need anywhere near this number of servers running. 
</para>

<para>
 Please be aware that the example above is just one of many, many possible
 system configurations. Yours probably does look very different.
</para>

<para>
 You don't understand what any of this is telling you? Hopefully then, you've
 read the <command>netstat</command> <link linkend="netstat">tutorial</link>
 in the Appendix, and understand how it works. Understanding exactly what each
 server is in the above example, and what it does, is beyond the scope of this
 document. You will have to check your system's documentation (e.g.
 Installation Guide, man pages, etc) if that service is important to you.  For
 example, does <quote>exec</quote>, <quote>login</quote>, and <quote>shell</quote> 
 sound important? Yes, but these are not what they may sound like. They 
 are actually <command>rexec</command>, <command>rlogin</command>, and
 <command>rsh</command>, the <quote>r</quote> (for remote) commands. These are 
 antiquated, unnecessary, and in fact, are very dangerous if exposed to the
 Internet.

</para>

<para>
 Let's make a few quick assumptions about what is necessary and unnecessary,
 and therefore what goes and what stays on bigcat. Since we are running a
 desktop on bigcat, <application>X11</application> of course needs to stay. If
 bigcat were a dedicated server of some kind, then X11 would be unnecessary. If
 there is a printer physically attached, the printer (lp) daemon should stay.
 Otherwise, it goes. Print servers may sound harmless, but are potential
 targets too since they can hold ports open. If we plan on logging
 <emphasis>in to</emphasis> bigcat <emphasis>from</emphasis> other hosts,
 sshd (Secure SHell Daemon) would be necessary. If we have Microsoft hosts on
 our LAN, we probably want <application>Samba</application>, so
 <application>smbd</application> should stay. Otherwise, it is completely
 unnecessary. Everything else in this example is optional and not required for
 a normally functioning system, and should probably go. See anything that you
 don't recognize? Not sure about? It goes!

</para>

<para>
 To sum up: since bigcat is a desktop with a printer attached, we will 
 need <quote>x11</quote>, <quote>printer</quote>. bigcat is on a LAN with 
 MS hosts, and shares files and printing with them, so
 <quote>netbios-ssn</quote> (<command>smbd</command>) is desired. We will also
 need <quote>ssh</quote> so we can login from other machines. Everything else
 is unnecessary for this particular case. 

</para>

<para>
 Nervous about this? If you want, you can make notes of any changes you make
 or save the list of servers you got from <command>netstat</command>, with
 this command: <literal>netstat -tap |grep LISTEN > ~/services.lst</literal>.
 That will save it your home directory with the name of
 <quote>services.lst</quote> for future reference.
</para>

<para>
 This is to not say that the ones we have decided to keep are inherently safe.
 Just that we probably need these. So we will have to deal with these via
 firewalling or other means (addressed below).

</para>

<para>
 It is worth noting that the <command>telnet</command> and
 <command>ftp</command> daemons in the above example are
 <emphasis>servers</emphasis>, aka <quote>listeners</quote>. These accept
 incoming connections to you. You do not need, or want, these just to use
 <command>ftp</command> or <command>telnet</command>
 <emphasis>clients</emphasis>. For instance, you can download files from an
 FTP site with just an <command>ftp</command> client. Running an
 <application>ftp</application> server on your end is not required at all, and
 has serious security implications.

 Init services are typically started automatically during the boot process, or
 during a runlevel change. There is a naming scheme that uses symlinks to
 determine which services are to be started, or stopped, at any given
 runlevel. The scripts themselves should be in
 <filename>/etc/init.d/</filename> (or possibly
 <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d/</filename> <![%redhat;[ for older versions of
 Red Hat]]>). <![%linuxall;[ This init style is used by Red Hat,

 OK, if you can't find the <quote>right</quote> way to stop a service, 
 or maybe a service is being started and you can't find how or where, 
 you can <quote>kill</quote> the process. To do this, you will need to know
 the PID (Process I.D.). This can be found with <command>ps</command>, 
 <command>top</command>, <command>fuser</command> or other system utilities.
 For <command>top</command> and <command>ps</command>, this will be the number
 in the first column. See the <link linkend="pid">Port and Process Owner</link>

 Again, our rule of thumb is if we don't need it, we won't run it. It's that

    <application>identd</application> - This is a protocol that has been
    around for ages, and is often installed and running by default. It is used
    to provide a minimal amount of information about who is connecting to a
    server. But, it is not necessary in many cases. Where might you need it?
    Most IRC servers require it. Many mail servers use it, but don't really
    require it. Try your mail setup without it. If
    <application>identd</application> is going to be a problem, it will
    be because there is a time out before the server starts sending or
    receiving mail. So mail should work fine without it, but may be slower. A
    few <application>ftp</application> servers may require it. Most don't
    though.

   <para>
    The <literal>-o</literal> flag tells <application>identd</application> to
    not reveal the operating system type it is run on and to instead always

    to always return <quote>UNKNOWN-ERROR</quote> instead of the
    <quote>NO-USER</quote> or <quote>INVALID-PORT</quote> errors. The
    <literal>-n</literal> flag tells identd to  always  return  user numbers
    instead of user names, if you wish to keep the user names a secret. The
    <literal>-N</literal> flag makes identd check for the file
    <filename>.noident</filename> in the user's home directory for which the
    daemon is about to return a user name. It that  file  exists then the
    daemon will give the error <quote>HIDDEN-USER</quote> instead of the

     Mail server (MTA's like <application>sendmail</application>,
     <application>qmail</application>, etc) - Often a fully functional mail
     server like <application>sendmail</application> is installed by default.
     The only time that this is actually required is if you are hosting a
     domain, and receiving incoming mail directly. Or possibly, for exchanging
     mail on a LAN, in which case it does not need Internet exposure and can
     be safely firewalled. For your ISP's POP mail access, you don't need it
     even though this is a common configuration. One alternative here is to
     use <application>fetchmail</application> for POP mail retrieval with the
     <literal>-m</literal> option to specify a local delivery agent:
     <literal>fetchmail -m procmail</literal> for instance works with no
     sendmail daemon running at all. Sendmail, can be handy to have running,

<title>Step 2: Updating</title>

<para>
 OK, this section should be comparatively short, simple and straightforward
 compared to the above, but no less important.
</para>

<para>
 The very first thing after a new install you should check <![%linuxall;[ your
 distribution's updates and security notices and apply all patches]]>
 <![%redhat;[ the errata notices at <ulink
 url="http://redhat.com/errata/">http://redhat.com/apps/errata/</ulink>,
 and apply all relevant updates]]>. Only a year old you say? That's a long
 time actually, and not current enough to be safe. Only a few months or few
 weeks? Check anyway. A day or two? Better safe than sorry. It is quite
 possible that security updates have been released during the pre-release
 phase of the development and release cycle. If you can't take this step,
 disable any publicly accessible services until you can.

</para>

<para>
 Linux distributions are not static entities. They are updated with new, 
 patched packages as the need arises. The updates are just as important 
 as the original installation. Even more so, since they are fixes. Sometimes
 these updates are bug fixes, but quite often they are security fixes because
 some hole has been discovered. Such <quote>holes</quote> are
 <emphasis>immediately</emphasis> known to the cracker community, and they are
 quick to exploit them on a large scale. Once the hole is known, it is quite
 simple to get in through it, and there will be many out there looking for it.
 And Linux developers are also equally quick to provide fixes. Sometimes the
 same day as the hole has become known!

</para>

<para>
 Keeping <emphasis>all</emphasis> installed packages current with your release 
 is one of the most important steps you can take in maintaining a secure
 system. It can not be emphasized enough that all installed packages should be
 kept updated -- not just the ones you use. If this is burdensome, consider
 uninstalling any unused packages. Actually this is a good idea anyway. 

</para>

<para>
 But where to get this information in a timely fashion? There are a number of
 web sites that offer the latest security news. There are also a number of
 mailing lists dedicated to this topic. <![%linuxall;[ In fact, your vendor
 most likely has such a list where vulnerabilities and the corresponding fix
 is announced. ]]> <![%redhat;[ In fact, Red Hat has the <quote>watch</quote>
 list, just for this purpose at <ulink
 url="https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/redhat-watch-list">https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/redhat-watch-list</ulink>. This is a very low 
 volume list by the way. ]]> This is an excellent way to stay abreast of
 issues effecting your release, and is <emphasis>highly
 recommended</emphasis>. <ulink
 url="http://linuxsecurity.com">http://linuxsecurity.com</ulink> is a good
 site for Linux only issues. They also have weekly newsletters available:
 <ulink
 url="http://www.linuxsecurity.com/general/newsletter.html">http://www.linuxsecurity.com/general/newsletter.html</ulink>.
 
</para>

<para>
 <![%linuxall;[ Also, many distributions have utilities that will automatically update your 
 installed packages via ftp. This can be run as a
 <application>cron</application> job on a regular basis and is a painless 
 way to go if you have ready Internet access.  ]]>
 <![%redhat;[ Red Hat also has the <application>up2date</application> utility 
 for automatically keeping your system(s) up to date ;-). See the man page 
 for details.]]>

</para>

<!--
<para>
 If you are running public services over the Internet, you can further stay
 ahead of the curve, by running the latest version of these packages, whether
 they are an official update to your distribution or not. 

</para>
-->

<para>
 This is not a one time process -- it is ongoing. It is important to stay 
 current. So watch those security notices. And subscribe to 
 <![%linuxall;[  your vendor's ]]> <![%redhat;[ that ]]>
 security mailing list today! If you have cable modem, DSL, or other 
 full time connection, there is no excuse not to do this religiously. 
 All distributions make this easy enough!
 
</para>

<para>
 One last note: any time a new package is installed, there is also a 
 chance that a new or revised configuration has been installed as well. 
 Which means that if this package is a server of some kind, it may be 
 enabled as a result of the update. This is bad manners, but it can 
 happen, so be sure to run <application>netstat</application> or 
 comparable to verify your system is where you want it after any 
 updates or system changes. In fact, do it periodically even if there are no
 such changes.

 It is very simple: make sure your Linux installation is current. Check 
 <![%linuxall;[ with your vendor  ]]> <![%redhat;[ the Red Hat errata ]]>

 wrong with running an older release, just so the packages in it are 
 updated according to what <![%linuxall;[ your vendor ]]> <![%redhat;[ Red Hat ]]>
 has made available since the initial release. At least as long as 
 <![%linuxall;[ your vendor  ]]> <![%redhat;[ Red Hat ]]> is still supporting

<sect1 id="firewalls">
<title>Step 3: Firewalls and Setting Access Policies</title>

<para>
 So what is a <quote>firewall</quote>? It's a vague term that can mean
 anything that acts as a protective barrier between us and the outside world.
 This can be a dedicated system, or a specific application that provides this
 functionality. Or it can be a combination of components, including various
 combinations of hardware and software. Firewalls are built from 
 <quote>rules</quote> that are used to define what is allowed to enter and
 exit a given system or network. Let's look at some of the possible components
 that are readily available for Linux, and how we might implement a reasonably
 safe firewalling strategy.

</para>

<para>
 In Step 1 above, we have turned off all services we don't need. In our 
 example, there were a few we still needed to have running. In this 
 section, we will take the next step here and decide which we need to leave
 open to the world. And which we might be able to restrict in some way. If we can
 block them all, so much the better, but this is not always practical.

</para>


<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->

<sect2 id="strategy">
<title>Strategy</title>

<para>
 What we want to do now is restrict connections and traffic so that we only 
 allow the minimum necessary for whatever our particular situation is. In
 some cases we may want to block all incoming <quote>new</quote> connection
 attempts. Example: we want to run <application>X</application>, but don't
 want anyone from outside to access it, so we'll block it completely from 
 outside connections.  In other situations, we may want to limit, or restrict,
 incoming connections to trusted sources only. The more restrictive, the
 better. Example: we want to <command>ssh</command> into our system from
 outside, but we only ever do this from our workplace. So we'll limit
 <command>sshd</command> connections to our workplace address range. There are
 various ways to do this, and we'll look at the most common ones. 
 
</para>

<para>
 We also will not want to limit our firewall to any one application. There is 
 nothing wrong with a <quote>layered</quote> defense-in-depth approach. Our
 front line protection will be a packet filter -- either
 <application>ipchains</application> or <application>iptables</application>
 (see below). Then we can use additional tools and mechanisms to reinforce 
 our firewall.
 
</para>

<para>
 We will include some brief examples. Our rule of thumb will be to deny
 everything as the default policy, then open up just what we need. We'll try
 to keep this as simple as possible since it can be an involved and complex

<title>Packet Filters -- Ipchains and Iptables</title>

<para>
 <quote>Packet filters</quote> (like <application>ipchains</application>) 
 have the ability to look at individual packets, and make decisions based 
 on what they find. These can be used for many purposes. One common purpose
 is to implement a firewall.
</para>

<para>
 Common packet filters on Linux are <application>ipchains</application> which
 is standard with 2.2 kernels, and <application>iptables</application> which
 is available with the more recent 2.4 kernels.
 <application>iptables</application> has more advanced packet filtering
 capabilities and is recommended for anyone running a 2.4 kernel. But either
 can be effective for our purposes. <application>ipfwadm</application> is 
 a similar utility for 2.0 kernels (not discussed here).
 
</para>

<para>
 If constructing your own <application>ipchains</application> or
 <application>iptables</application> firewall rules seems a bit daunting,
 there are various sites that can automate the process. See the 
 <link linkend="links">Links section</link>. Also the included examples may be
 used as a starting point. 
 <![%linuxall;[ And your distribution may be including a 
 utility of some kind for generating a firewall script.  ]]> 
 <![%redhat;[ As of Red Hat 7.1, Red Hat is providing init scripts 
 for <application>ipchains</application> and <application>iptables</application>, 
 and <application>gnome-lokkit</application> for generating a very basic
 set of firewall rules (<link linkend="lokkit">see below</link>). ]]> This may be
 adequate, but it is still recommended to know the proper syntax and 
 how the various mechanisms work as such tools rarely do more than a 
 few very simple rules.

</para>

<note>
 <para>
  Various examples are given below. These are presented for illustrative 
  purposes to demonstrate some of the concepts being discussed here. 
  While they might also be useful as a starting point for your own 
  script, please note that they are not meant to be all encompassing.
  You are strongly encouraged to understand how the scripts work, so 
  you can create something even more tailored for your own situation.
 </para>
 <para>
  The example scripts are just protecting inbound connections to one interface 
  (the one connected to the Internet). This may be adequate for many simple
  home type situations, but, conversely, this approach is not adequate for 
  <emphasis>all</emphasis> situations!

<sect3 id="ipchains">
<title>ipchains</title>
<para>
 <application>ipchains</application> can be used with either 2.2 or 2.4
 kernels. When <application>ipchains</application> is in place, it checks
 every packet that moves through the system. The packets move across different
 <quote>chains</quote>, depending where they originate and where they are
 going. Think of <quote>chains</quote> as rule sets. In advanced
 configurations, we could define our own custom chains. The three default
 built-in chains are <literal>input</literal>, which is incoming traffic,
 <literal>output</literal>, which is outgoing traffic, and
 <literal>forward</literal>, which is traffic being forwarded from one
 interface to another (typically used for <quote>masquerading</quote>).
 Chains can be manipulated in various ways to control the flow of traffic in
 and out of our system. Rules can be added at our discretion to achieve 
 the desired result.

</para>

<para>
 At the end of every <quote>chain</quote> is a <quote>target</quote>. The 
 target is specified with the <literal>-j</literal> option to the command. The
 target is what decides the fate of the packet and essentially terminates that
 particular chain. The most common targets are mostly self-explanatory:
 <literal>ACCEPT</literal>, <literal>DENY</literal>,
 <literal>REJECT</literal>, and <literal>MASQ</literal>.
 <literal>MASQ</literal> is for <quote>ipmasquerading</quote>.
 <literal>DENY</literal> and <literal>REJECT</literal> essentially do the
 same thing, though in different ways. Is one better than the other? That is
 the subject of much debate, and depends on other factors that are beyond the
 scope of this document. For our purposes, either should suffice.
 
</para>

<para>
 <application>ipchains</application> has a very flexible configuration. Port 
 (or port ranges), interfaces, destination address, source address can be
 specified, as well as various other options. The man page explains these 
 details well enough that we won't get into specifics here.
</para>

<para>
 Traffic entering our system from the Internet, enters via the
 <literal>input</literal> chain. This is the one that we need as tight as we
 can make it.
</para>

<para>
 Below is a brief example script for a hypothetical system. We'll let the
 comments explain what this script does. Anything starting with a 
 <quote>#</quote> is a comment. <application>ipchains</application> rules 
 are generally incorporated into shell scripts, using shell variables to 
 help implement the firewalling logic.

</para>

<para>
 To use the above script would require that it is executable (i.e. 
 <literal>chmod +x ipchains.sh</literal>), and run by root to build the
 chains, and hence the firewall. 

</para>

<para>
 To summarize what this example did was to start by setting some shell 
 variables in the top section, to be used later in the script. Then we set
 the default rules (ipchains calls these <quote>policies</quote>) of denying
 all inbound and forwarded traffic, and of allowing all our own outbound
 traffic. We had to open some holes in the high, unprivileged ports so
 that we could have return traffic from connections that bigcat initiates to
 outside addresses. If we connect to someone's web server, we want that HTML
 data to be able to get back to us, for instance. The same applies to other
 network traffic. We then allowed a few specific types of the ICMP protocol
 (most are still blocked). We are also logging any inbound traffic that
 violates any of our rules so we know who is doing what. Notice that we are
 only using IP address here, not hostnames of any kind. This is so that 
 our firewall works, even in situation where there may be DNS failures. 
 Also, to prevent any kind of DNS spoofing.

</para>

<para>
 See the <application>ipchains</application> man page for a full explanation 
 of syntax. The important ones we used here are:

</para>

<blockquote>

 <simplelist>
  <member>
   &nbsp;<literal>-A input</literal>: Adds a rule to the
   <quote>input</quote> chain. The default chains are input, output, and forward.
  </member>
 </simplelist>

 <simplelist>
  <member>
   &nbsp;<literal>-p udp</literal>: This rule only applies to the
   <quote>UDP</quote> <quote>protocol</quote>. The <literal>-p</literal> 
   option can be used with tcp, udp or icmp protocols.
  </member>
 </simplelist>

 <simplelist>
  <member>
   &nbsp;<literal>-i $WAN_IFACE</literal>: This rule applies to the specified
   interface only, and applies to whatever chain is referenced (input, output,
   or forward).
  </member>
 </simplelist>

 <simplelist>
  <member>
   &nbsp;<literal>-s &lt;IP address&gt;</literal> [port]: This rule only
   applies to the source address as specified. It can optionally have a port
   (e.g. 22) immediately afterward, or port range, e.g. 1023:4999. 
  </member>
 </simplelist>

 <simplelist>
  <member>
   &nbsp;<literal>-d &lt;IP address&gt;</literal> [port]: This rule only
   applies to the destination address as specified. Also, it may include port or
   port range.
  </member>
 </simplelist>

 <simplelist>
  <member>
   &nbsp;<literal>-l</literal> : Any packet that hits a rule with this option
   is logged (lower case <quote>L</quote>). 
  </member>
 </simplelist>

 <simplelist>
  <member>
   &nbsp;<literal>-j ACCEPT</literal>: Jumps to the <quote>ACCEPT</quote> 
   <quote>target</quote>. This effectively terminates this chain 
   and decides the ultimate fate for this particular packet, which in this 
   example is to <quote>ACCEPT</quote> it. The same is 
   true for other <literal>-j</literal> targets like <literal>DENY</literal>.
  </member>
 </simplelist>

</blockquote>

<para>
 By and large, the order in which command line options are specified is not
 significant. The chain name (e.g. <literal>input</literal>) must come first
 though.

</para>

<para>
 Remember in Step 1 when we ran <command>netstat</command>, we had
 both X and print servers running among other things. We don't want these
 exposed to the Internet, even in a limited way. These are still happily
 running on bigcat, but are now safe and sound behind our
 <application>ipchains</application> based firewall. You probably have other
 services that fall in this category as well.

</para>

<para>
 The above example is a simplistic all or none approach. We allow all our own
 outbound traffic (not necessarily a good idea), and block all inbound
 connection attempts from outside. It is only protecting one interface, and 
 really just the inbound side of that interface. It would more than likely
 require a bit of fine tuning to make it work for you. For a more advanced set
 of rules, see the <link linkend="pfilters">Appendix</link>. And you might
 want to read <ulink
 url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/IPCHAINS-HOWTO.html">http://tldp.org/HOWTO/IPCHAINS-HOWTO.html</ulink>.

</para>

<para>
 Whenever you have made changes to your firewall, you should verify its
 integrity. One step to make sure your rules seem to be doing what you 
 intended, is to see how <application>ipchains</application> has interpreted 
 your script. You can do this by opening your <application>xterm</application> 
 very wide, and issuing the following command:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 # ipchains -L -n -v | less

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 The output is grouped according to chain. You should also find a way to scan
 yourself (see the <link linkend="verify">Verifying section</link> below). And
 then keep an eye on your logs to make sure you are blocking what is
 intended.

<sect3 id="iptables">
<title>iptables</title>

<para>
 <application>iptables</application> is the next generation packet filter for
 Linux, and requires a 2.4 kernel. It can do everything
 <application>ipchains</application> can, but has a number of noteworthy
 enhancements. The syntax is similar to <application>ipchains</application> in
 many respects. See the man page for details.

</para>

<para>
 The most noteworthy enhancement is <quote>connection tracking</quote>, also
 known as <quote>stateful inspection</quote>. This gives
 <application>iptables</application> more knowledge of the state of each
 packet. Not only does it know if the packet is a TCP or UDP packet, or
 whether it has the SYN or ACK flags set, but also if it is part of an existing
 connection, or related somehow to an existing connection. The implications 
 for firewalling should be obvious.

</para>

<para>
 The bottom line is that it is easier to get a tight firewall with
 <application>iptables</application>, than with
 <application>ipchains</application>. So this is the recommended way to go.

</para>

<para>
 The same script logic is used here, and thus this does pretty much the same
 exact thing as the <application>ipchains</application> script in the
 previous section. There are some subtle differences as to syntax. Note the
 case difference in the chain names for one (e.g. INPUT vs input). Logging is
 handled differently too. It has its own <quote>target</quote> now
 (<literal>-j LOG</literal>), and is much more flexible.

</para>

<para>
 There are some very fundamental differences as well, that might not be so
 obvious. Remember this section from the <application>ipchains</application> 
 script:
</para>

<para>
 <programlisting>

# Accept non-SYN TCP, and UDP connections to LOCAL_PORTS. These are the high,
# unprivileged ports (1024 to 4999 by default). This will allow return
# connection traffic for connections that we initiate to outside sources.
# TCP connections are opened with 'SYN' packets. We have already opened 
# those services that need to accept SYNs for, so other SYNs are excluded here
# for everything else.
$IPCHAINS -A input -p tcp -s $ANYWHERE -d $WAN_IP $LOCAL_PORTS ! -y -j ACCEPT 

# We can't be so selective with UDP since that protocol does not know 
# about SYNs.
$IPCHAINS -A input -p udp -s $ANYWHERE -d $WAN_IP $LOCAL_PORTS -j ACCEPT 

 </programlisting>
</para>

<para>
 We jumped through hoops here with <application>ipchains</application> so 
 that we could restrict unwanted, incoming connections as much as possible. A
 bit of a kludge, actually.

</para>

<para>
 That section is missing from the <application>iptables</application> version. 
 It is not needed as connection tracking handles this quite nicely, and then
 some. This is due to the <quote>statefulness</quote> of
 <application>iptables</application>. It knows more about each packet than 
 <application>ipchains</application>. For instance, it knows whether the 
 packet is part of a <quote>new</quote> connection, or an
 <quote>established</quote> connection, or a <quote>related</quote>
 connection. This is the so-called <quote>stateful inspection</quote> of 
 connection tracking.

</para>

<!--

<para>
 To show another brief example and just how much work connection tracking can
 do for us, here is an short and sweet example from the Netfilter
 Packet-Filtering HOWTO:

</para>


<para>
 This very succinct example shows the use of a user defined chain -
 <quote>block</quote> here, which is jumped to from the only
 <literal>INPUT</literal> and <literal>FORWARD</literal> rules there at the
 end. This essentially allows all outbound traffic (since
 <literal>OUTPUT</literal> is not defined here and that is the default
 behavior). And then any connections that are <literal>ESTABLISHED</literal>
 or <literal>RELATED</literal> to those <literal>OUTPUT</literal> connections
 that we generate. So <quote>connection tracking</quote> is doing the lion's
 share of the work here.

<title>Tcpwrappers (libwrap)</title>

<para>
 <application>Tcpwrappers</application> provides much the same desired results
 as <application>ipchains</application> and
 <application>iptables</application> above, though works quite differently.
 <application>Tcpwrappers</application> actually intercepts the connection
 attempt, then examines its configurations files, and decides whether to
 accept or reject the request. <application>Tcpwrappers</application> 
 controls access at the application level, rather than the socket level 
 like <application>iptables</application> and <application>ipchains</application>.
 This can be quite effective, and is a standard component on most Linux
 systems.

</para>

<para>
 <application>Tcpwrappers</application> consists of the configuration 
 files <filename>/etc/hosts.allow</filename> and
 <filename>/etc/hosts.deny</filename>. The functionality is provided by the 
 <application>libwrap</application> library. 

</para>

<para>
 <application>Tcpwrappers</application> first looks to see if access is
 permitted in <filename>/etc/hosts.allow</filename>, and if so, access is
 granted. If not in <filename>/etc/hosts.allow</filename>, the file
 <filename>/etc/hosts.deny</filename> is then checked to see if access is
 <emphasis>not</emphasis> allowed. If so, access is denied. Else,
 <emphasis>access is granted</emphasis>.  For this reason,
 <filename>/etc/hosts.deny</filename> should contain only one uncommented
 line, and that is: <literal>ALL: ALL</literal>. Access should then be
 permitted through entries in <filename>/etc/hosts.allow</filename>, where
 specific services are listed, along with the specific host addresses allowed
 to access these services. While hostnames can be used here, use of hostnames
 opens the limited possibility for name spoofing.

</para>

<para>
 <application>Tcpwrappers</application> is commonly used to protect services
 that are started via <application>inetd</application> (or 
 <application>xinetd</application>). But also any program 
 that has been compiled with <application>libwrap</application> support, can 
 take advantage of it. Just don't assume that all programs have built in 
 <application>libwrap</application> support -- they do not. In fact, most 
 probably don't. So we will only use it in our examples here to protect
 services start via <application>inetd</application>. And then rely on our
 packet filtering firewall, or other mechanism, to protect non-(x)inetd
 services.

</para>

<para>
 Below is a small snippet from a typical <filename>inetd.conf</filename> file:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 # Pop and imap mail services et al
 #
 #pop-2   stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd ipop2d
 #pop-3   stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd ipop3d
 #imap    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd imapd
 #

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 The second to last column is the <application>tcpwrappers</application>
 daemon -- <command>/usr/sbin/tcpd</command>. Immediately after is the daemon
 it is protecting. In this case, <application>POP</application> and
 <application>IMAP</application> mail servers. Your distro probably has 
 already done this part for you. For the few applications that have built-in
 support for <application>tcpwrappers</application> via the
 <application>libwrap</application> library, specifying the daemon as above 
 is not necessary.

</para>

<para>
 We will use the same principles here: default policy is to deny everything,
 then open holes to allow the minimal amount of traffic necessary.

</para>

<para>
 So now with your text editor, <command>su</command> to root and open
 <filename>/etc/hosts.deny</filename>. If it does not exist, then create 
 it. It is just a plain text file. We want the following line:

 If it is there already, fine. If not, add it in and then save and close file.
 Easy enough. <quote>ALL</quote> is one of the keywords that
 <application>tcpwrappers</application> understands. The format is
 <literal>$SERVICE_NAME : $WHO</literal>, so we are denying all connections to
 all services here. At least all services that are using
 <application>tcpwrappers</application>. Remember, this will primarily be
 <application>inetd</application> services. See <literal>man 5
 hosts_access</literal> for details on the syntax of these files. Note the
 <quote>5</quote> there!

</para>

<para>
 Now let's open up just the services we need, as restrictively as we can, 
 with a brief example:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 ALL: 127.0.0.1
 sshd,ipop3d: 192.168.1.
 sshd: .myworkplace.com, hostess.mymomshouse.com 

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 The first line allows all <quote>localhost</quote> connections. 
 You will need this. The second
 allows connections to the <application>sshd</application> and 
 <application>ipop3d</application> services from IP addresses that start with
 <literal>192.168.1.</literal>, in this case the private address range for
 our hypothetical home LAN. Note the trailing <quote>.</quote>. It's
 important. The third line allows connections to only our
 <application>sshd</application> daemon from any host associated with
 <literal>.myworkplace.com</literal>. Note the leading <quote>.</quote> in
 this example. And then also, the single host
 <literal>hostess.mymomshouse.com</literal>. In summary, localhost and all
 our LAN connections have access to any and all tcpwrappered services on
 bigcat. But only our workplace addresses, and our mother can use
 <application>sshd</application> on bigcat from outside connections. Everybody
 else is denied by the default policy in <filename>/etc/hosts.deny</filename>.
 
</para>

<para>
 The types of wild cards above (<literal>.myworkplace.com</literal> and 
 <literal>192.168.1.</literal>) are not supported by
 <application>ipchains</application> and <application>iptables</application>,
 or most other Linux applications for that matter. Also, 
 <application>tcpwrappers</application> can use hostnames in place of 
 IP addresses which is quite handy in some situations. This does 
 not work with <application>ipchains</application> and 
 <application>iptables</application>. 

</para>

<para>
 You can test your <application>tcpwrappers</application> configuration 
 with the included <command>tcpdchk</command> utility (see the man page). Note
 that at this time this does not work with <application>xinetd</application>,
 and may not even be included in this case.

</para>

<para>
 There is nothing wrong with using both <application>tcpwrappers</application>
 and a packet filtering firewall like <application>ipchains</application>. In
 fact, it is recommended to use a <quote>layered</quote> approach. This 
 helps guard against accidental misconfigurations. In this case, each 
 connection will be tested by the packet filter rules first, then 
 <application>tcpwrappers</application>. 

</para>

<para>
 Remember to make backup copies before editing system configuration files, 
 restart the daemon afterward, and then check the logs for error messages.

<title>xinetd</title>

<para>
 As mentioned, <ulink url="http://www.xinetd.org">xinetd</ulink> is an
 enhanced <application>inetd</application> <![%redhat;[, and replaces
 <application>inetd</application> as of Red Hat 7.0]]>. It has much of the
 same functionality, with some notable enhancements. One is that
 <application>tcpwrappers</application> support <![%linuxall;[ can ]]> be
 <![%redhat;[ is ]]> compiled in, eliminating the need for explicit references to
 <command>tcpd</command>. Which means <filename>/etc/hosts.allow</filename>
 and <filename>/etc/hosts.deny</filename> are automatically in effect. 
 <![%linuxall;[ Don't
 assume this is the case though. A little testing, then viewing the logs
 should be able to tell you whether <application>tcpwrappers</application>
 support is automatic or not.  ]]>
 
</para>

<para>
 Some of <application>xinetd's</application> other enhancements: specify 
 IP address to listen on, which is a very effective method of access control;
 limit the rate of incoming connections and the total number of simultaneous
 connections; limit services to specific times of day. See the 
 <application>xinetd</application> and <application>xinetd.conf</application>
 man pages for more details.

</para>

<para>
 The syntax is quite different though. An example from 
 <filename>/etc/xinetd.d/tftp</filename>:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 service tftp
 {
        socket_type     = dgram
        bind            = 192.168.1.1
        instances       = 2
        protocol        = udp
        wait            = yes
        user            = nobody
        only_from       = 192.168.1.0
        server          = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
        server_args     = /tftpboot
        disable         = no
 }

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 Notice the <literal>bind</literal> statement. We are only listening on, 
 or <quote>binding</quote> to, the private, LAN interface here. No outside
 connections can be made since the outside port is not even opened. We are
 also only accepting connections from <literal>192.168.1.0</literal>, our LAN.
 For <application>xinetd's</application> purposes, this denotes any IP
 address beginning with <quote>192.168.1</quote>. Note that the syntax is different
 from <application>inetd</application>. The <literal>server</literal>
 statement in this case is the <command>tftp</command> daemon,
 <command>in.tftpd</command>. Again, this assumes that
 <application>libwrap/tcpwrappers</application> support is compiled into
 <application>xinetd</application>. The <literal>user</literal> running the
 daemon will be <quote>nobody</quote>. Yes, there is a user account called
 <quote>nobody</quote>, and it is wise to run such daemons as non-root users
 whenever possible. Lastly, the <literal>disable</literal> statement is
 <application>xinetd's</application> way of turning services on or off. In
 this case, it is <quote>on</quote>. This is on here only as an example. Do
 NOT run <application>tftp</application> as a public service as it is unsafe.

<sect2 id="portsentry">
<title>PortSentry</title>

<para>
 <ulink url="http://www.psionic.org/products/portsentry.html">Portsentry</ulink> 
 works quite differently than the other tools discussed so far. 
 <application>Portsentry</application> does what its name implies -- 
 it guards ports. <application>Portsentry</application> is configured with the
 <filename>/etc/portsentry/portsentry.conf</filename> file.
 
</para>

<para>
 Unlike the other applications discussed above, it does this by actually
 becoming the listening server on those ports. Kind of like baiting a trap.
 Running <literal>netstat -taup</literal> as root while
 <application>portsentry</application> is running, will show
 <application>portsentry</application> as the <literal>LISTENER</literal> on
 whatever ports <application>portsentry</application> is configured for. If
 <application>portsentry</application> senses a connection attempt, it blocks
 it completely. And then goes a step further and blocks the route to that host
 to stop all further traffic. Alternately, <application>ipchains</application>
 or <application>iptables</application> can be used to block the host
 completely. So it makes an excellent tool to stop port scanning of a range of
 ports.
 
</para>

<para>
 But <application>portsentry</application> has limited flexibility as to 
 whether it allows a given connection. It is pretty much all or nothing. You
 can define specific IP addresses that it will ignore in 
 <filename>/etc/portsentry/portsentry.ignore</filename>. But you cannot allow
 selective access to individual ports. This is because only one server can 
 bind to a particular port at the same time, and in this case that is 
 <application>portsentry</application> itself. So it has limited usefulness as a
 stand-alone firewall. As part of an overall firewall strategy, yes, it can
 be quite useful. For most of us, it should not be our first line of defense,
 and we should only use it in conjunction with other tools.
 
</para>

  Do not use in conjunction with <application>inetd</application> services --

 </para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
 <para>

 </para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
 <para>  
  If you are <emphasis>very sure</emphasis> you have no exposed public servers
  at all, and you just want to know who is up to what. But do not assume 
  anything about what <application>portsentry</application> is protecting. 
  By default it does not watch all ports, and may even leave some very 
  commonly probed ports open. So make sure you configure it accordingly.
  And make sure you have tested and verified your set up first, and that
  nothing is exposed.

<sect2 id="proxies">
<title>Proxies</title>

<para>
 The dictionary defines <quote>proxy</quote> as <quote>the authority or power
 to act on behalf of another</quote>. This pretty well describes software proxies as
 well. It is an intermediary in the connection path. As an example, if we
 were using a web proxy like <quote>squid</quote> (<ulink
 url="http://www.squid-cache.org/">http://www.squid-cache.org/</ulink>), 
 every time we browse to a web site, we
 would actually be connecting to our locally running <application>squid</application> server.
 Squid in turn, would relay our request to the ultimate, real destination. And
 then <application>squid</application> would relay the web pages back to us. It is
 a go-between. Like <quote>firewalls</quote>, a <quote>proxy</quote> can refer
 to either a specific application, or a dedicated server which runs a proxy
 application. 

</para>

<para>
 Proxies can perform various duties, not all of which have much to do with
 security. But the fact that they are an intermediary, makes them a good place
 to enforce access control policies, limit direct connections through a
 firewall, and control how the network behind the proxy looks to the Internet.
 So this makes them strong candidates to be part of an overall firewall
 strategy. And, in fact, are sometimes used instead of packet filtering
 firewalls. Proxy based firewalls probably make more sense where many users
 are behind the same firewall. And it probably is not high on the list of
 components necessary for home based systems. 

</para>

<para>
 Configuring and administering proxies can be complex, and is beyond the scope of
 this document. The Firewall and Proxy Server HOWTO, <ulink url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Firewall-HOWTO.html

<sect2 id="verify">
<title>Verifying</title>

<para>
 The final step after getting your firewall in place, is to verify that it 
 is doing what you intended. You would be wise to do this anytime you make 
 even minor changes to your system configuration. 
</para>

<para>
 So how to do this? There are several things you can do.
</para>

<para>
 For our packet filters like <application>ipchains</application> and 
 <application>iptables</application>, we can list all our rules, chains, 
 and associated activity with <literal>iptables -nvL | less</literal>
 (substitute <command>ipchains</command> if appropriate). Open 
 your xterm as wide as possible to avoid wrapping long lines. 
</para>

<para>
 This should give you an idea if your chains are doing what you think they 
 should. You may want to perform some of the on-line tasks you normally do 
 first: open a few web pages, send and retrieve mail, etc. This will, of 
 course, not give you any information on <application>tcpwrappers</application> or 
 <application>portsentry</application>. <command>tcpdchk</command> can 
 be used to verify <application>tcpwrappers</application> configuration 
 (except with <application>xinetd</application>).

</para>

<para>
 And then, scan yourself. <application>nmap</application> is the scanning 
 tool of choice and <![%linuxall;[  may be available via your distribution]]> 
 <![%redhat;[ is included with recent Red Hat releases]]>, or from 
 <ulink url="http://www.insecure.org/nmap/nmap_download.html">http://www.insecure.org/nmap/nmap_download.html</ulink>. <application>nmap</application> is very 
 flexible, and essentially is a <quote>port prober</quote>. In other words, 
 it looks for open ports, among other things. See the
 <application>nmap</application> man page for details.
 
</para>

<para>
 If you do run <application>nmap</application> against yourself (e.g. 
 <literal>nmap localhost</literal>), this should tell you what ports are 
 open -- and <emphasis>visible locally</emphasis> only! Which hopefully by now, is
 quite different from what can be seen from the outside. So, scan yourself,
 and then find a trusted friend, or site (see the <link linkend="links">Links
 section</link>), to scan you from the outside. Make sure you are not
 violating your ISPs Terms of Service by port scanning. It may not be allowed,
 even if the intentions are honorable. Scanning from outside is the best way
 to know how the rest of the world sees you. This should tell you how well
 that firewall is working. See the <link linkend="nmap">nmap</link> section in
 the Appendix for some examples on <application>nmap</application> usage.
 
</para>

<para>
 One caveat on this: some ISPs may filter some ports, and you will not know
 for sure how well your firewall is working. Conversely, they make it look 
 like certain ports are open by using web, or other, proxies. The scanner 
 may see the web proxy at port 80 and mis-report it as an open port on your 
 system.  

</para>

<para>
 Another option is to find a website that offers <emphasis>full
 range</emphasis> testing. <ulink
 url="http://www.hackerwhacker.com">http://www.hackerwhacker.com</ulink> is
 one such site. Make sure that any such site is not just scanning a relatively
 few well known ports.

</para>

<para>
 Repeat this procedure with every firewall change, every system upgrade or new
 install, and when any key components of your system changes.

</para>

<para>
 You may also want to enable logging all the denied traffic. At least 
 temporarily. Once the firewall is verified to be doing what you think it 
 should, and if the logs are hopelessly overwhelming, you may want to disable
 logging. 

</para>

<para>
 If relying on <application>portsentry</application> at all, please read the 
 documentation. Depending on your configuration it will either drop the 
 route to the scanner, or implement a 
 <application>ipchains</application>/<application>iptables</application> rule
 doing the same thing. Also, since it <quote>listens</quote> on the 
 specified ports, all those ports will show as <quote>open</quote>. A false
 alarm in this case.

<sect2 id="logging">
<title>Logging</title>

<para>
 Linux does a lot of logging. Usually to more than one file. It is not always
 obvious what to make of all these entries -- good, bad or indifferent? Firewall 
 logs tend to generate a fair amount of each. Of course, you are wanting to 
 stop only the <quote>bad</quote>, but you will undoubtedly catch some
 harmless traffic as well. The 'net has a lot of background noise. 

</para>

<para>
 In many cases, knowing the intentions of an incoming packet are almost
 impossible. Attempted intrusion? Misbehaved protocol? Mis-typed IP address?
 Conclusions can be drawn based on factors such as destination port, source
 port, protocol, and many other variables. But there is no substitute for
 experience in interpreting firewall logs. It is a black art in many cases.

</para>

<para>
 So do we really need to log? And how much should we be trying to log? Logging
 is good in that it tells us that the firewall is functional. Even if we
 don't understand much of it, we know it is doing <quote>something</quote>.
 And if we have to, we can dig into those logs and find whatever data might be
 called for.
 
</para>

<para>
 On the other hand, logging can be bad if it is so excessive, it is difficult
 to find pertinent data, or worse, fills up a partition. Or if we over re-act
 and take every last entry as an all out assault. Some perspective is a great
 benefit, but something that new users lack almost by definition. Again, once
 your firewall is verified, and you are perplexed or overwhelmed, home
 desktop users may want to disable as much logging as possible. Anyone with
 greater responsibilities should log, and then find ways to extract the
 pertinent data from the logs by filtering out extraneous information.

</para>

<para>
 Not sure where to look for log data? <![%linuxall;[ This could conceivably be
 many places depending on how your distribution configured the various daemons
 and <command>syslogd</command>. Most logging is done in
 <filename>/var/log/*</filename>. Check that directory with <literal>ls -l
 /var/log/</literal> and see if you can tell the most active logs by size and
 timestamp. Also, look at <filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename> to see where
 the default logs are. <filename>/var/log/messages</filename> is a good place
 to look for starters.]]> <![%redhat;[ The two logs to keep an eye on are
 <filename>/var/log/messages</filename> and <filename>/var/log/secure</filename>.
 There may be other application specific logs, depending on what you have 
 installed, or using. <application>FTP</application>, for instance, logs 
 to <filename>/var/log/xfer</filename> on Red Hat.]]>

</para>

<para>
 <application>Portsentry</application> and <application>tcpwrappers</application> 
 do a certain amount of logging that is not adjustable.
 <application>xinetd</application> has logging enhancements that can be turned
 on. Both <application>ipchains</application> and
 <application>iptables</application>, on the other hand, are very flexible as
 to what is logged. 
</para>

<para>
 For <application>ipchains</application> the <literal>-l</literal> option can
 be added to any rule. <application>iptables</application> uses the
 <literal>-j LOG</literal> target, and requires its own, separate rule instead.
 <application>iptables</application> goes a few steps further and allows
 customized log entries, and rate limiting. See the man page. Presumably, we 
 are more interested in logging blocked traffic, so we'd confine logging to 
 only our <literal>DENY</literal> and <literal>REJECT</literal> rules.

</para>

<para>
 So whether you log, and how much you log, and what you do with the logs, is
 an individual decision, and probably will require some trial and error so
 that it is manageable. A few auditing and analytical tools can be quite 
 helpful:

<title>Where to Start</title>

<para>
 Let's take a quick look at where to run our firewall scripts from.
</para>

<para>
 <application>Portsentry</application> can be run as an init process, like
 other system services. It is not so important when this is done.
 <application>Tcpwrappers</application> will be automatically be invoked by
 <application>inetd</application> or <application>xinetd</application>, so not
 to worry there either.
 
</para>

<para>
 But the packet filtering scripts will have to be started somewhere. And many 
 scripts will have logic that uses the local IP address. This will mean that 
 the script must be started after the interface has come up and been assigned
 an IP address. Ideally, this should be immediately after the interface is up.
 So this depends on how you connect to the Internet. Also, for protocols like 
 <application>PPP</application> or <application>DHCP</application> that may 
 be dynamic, and get different IP's on each re-connect, it is best to have 
 the scripts run by the appropriate daemon.
 
</para>

<para>
 <![%linuxall;[ 
 For <application>PPP</application>, you probably have an 
 <filename>/etc/ppp/ip-up</filename> file. This will be executed every 
 time there is a connect or re-connect. You should put the full path to your 
 firewall script here. Check the local documentation for the correct 
 location. Debian use files in <filename>/etc/ppp/ip-up.d/</filename>, so 
 either put the script itself there, or a symlink to it.]]> Red Hat uses 
  <filename>/etc/ppp/ip-up.local</filename> for any user defined, local
 PPP configuration. <![%redhat;[ If this file does not exist, create it, and 
 make it executable (<literal>chmod +x</literal>). Then with your text editor, 
 add a reference to your firewall script.]]>

</para>

<para>
 For <application>DHCP</application>, it depends on which client. 
 <command>dhcpcd</command> will execute 
 <command>/etc/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-&lt;interface&gt;.exe</command> (e.g.
 dhcpcd-eth0.exe) whenever a lease is obtained or renewed. So this is where to
 put a reference to your firewall script. For
 <command>pump</command><![%redhat;[ (the default on Red Hat)]]>, the main
 configuration file is <filename>/etc/pump.conf</filename>.
 <command>Pump</command> will run whatever script is defined by the
 <quote>script</quote> statement any time there is a new or renewed lease:

</para>

<para>
 <programlisting>

 script /usr/local/bin/ipchains.sh

 </programlisting>
</para>

<para>
 If you have a static IP address (i.e. it never changes), the placement is not
 so important and should be <emphasis>before</emphasis> the interface comes
 up!

<title>Summary and Conclusions for Step 3</title>

<para>
 In this section we looked at various components that might be used to
 construct a <quote>firewall</quote>. And learned that a firewall is as  
 much a strategy and combination of components, as it is any one particular 
 application or component. We looked at a few of the most commonly available 
 applications that can be found on most, if not all, Linux systems. This is 
 not a definitive list.
</para>

<para>
 This is a lot of information to digest at all at one time and expect anyone 
 to understand it all. Hopefully this can used as a starting point, and 
 used for future reference as well. The packet filter firewall examples can be
 used as starting points as well. Just use your text editor, cut and paste
 into a file with an appropriate name, and then run <literal>chmod
 +x</literal> against it to make it executable. Some minor editing of the
 variables may be necessary. Also look at the <link
 linkend="links">Links</link> section for sites and utilities that can be
 used to generate a custom script. This may be a little less daunting.

</para>

<para>
 Now we are done with Steps 1, 2 and 3. Hopefully by now you have already
 instituted some basic measures to protect your system(s) from the various and
 sundry threats that lurk on networks. If you haven't implemented any of the
 above steps yet, now is a good time to take a break, go back to the top, and
 have at it. The most important steps are the ones above.
 
</para>

<para>
 A few quick conclusions...
</para>

<para>
 <quote>What is best <application>iptables</application>, 
 <application>ipchains</application>, <application>tcpwrappers</application>, 
 or <application>portsentry</application>?</quote> The quick answer is that 
 <application>iptables</application> can do more than any of the others. So 
 if you are using a 2.4 kernel, use 
 <application>iptables</application>. Then,
 <application>ipchains</application> if using a 2.2 kernel. The long answer is
 <quote>it just depends on what you are doing and what the objective
 is</quote>. Sorry. The other tools all have some merit in any given
 situation, and all can be effective in the right situation. 

</para>

<para>
 <quote>Do I really need all these packages?</quote> No, but please combine
 more than one approach, and please follow all the above recommendations.
 <application>iptables</application> by itself is good, but in conjunction
 with some of the other approaches, we are even stronger. Do not rely on any
 single mechanism to provide a security blanket. <quote>Layers</quote> of
 protection is always best. As is sound administrative practices. The best
 <application>iptables</application> script in the world is but one piece of
 the puzzle, and should not be used to hide other system weaknesses.

</para>

<para>
 <quote>If I have a small home LAN, do I need to have a firewall on each
 computer?</quote> No, not necessary as long as the LAN gateway has a properly
 configured firewall. Unwanted traffic should be stopped at that point. And as
 long as this is working as intended, there should be no unwanted traffic on
 the LAN. But, by the same token, doing this certainly does no harm. And on
 larger LANs that might be mixed platform, or with untrusted users, it would
 be advisable.

<title>Intrusion Detection</title>

<para>
 This section will deal with how to get early warning, how to be alerted 
 after the fact, and how to clean up from intrusion attempts.
 
</para>


<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->

<sect2 id="ids">
<title>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)</title>

<para>
 Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS for short) are designed to catch what might
 have gotten past the firewall. They can either be designed to catch an 
 active break-in attempt in progress, or to detect a successful break-in 
 after the fact. In the latter case, it is too late to prevent any damage, but
 at least we have early awareness of a problem. There are two basic types of
 IDS: those protecting networks, and those protecting individual hosts.

</para>

<para>
 For host based IDS, this is done with utilities that monitor the filesystem
 for changes. System files that have changed in some way, but should not
 change -- unless we did it -- are a dead give away that something is amiss.
 Anyone who gets in, and gets root, will presumably make changes to the system
 somewhere. This is usually the very first thing done. Either so he can get
 back in through a backdoor, or to launch an attack against someone else. In
 which case, he has to change or add files to the system. 

</para>

<para>
 This is where tools like tripwire (<ulink
 url="http://www.tripwire.org">http://www.tripwire.org</ulink>) play a role.
 <![%redhat;[ Tripwire is included beginning with Red Hat 7.0. ]]>
 Such tools monitor various aspects of the filesystem, and compare them against a
 stored database. And can be configured to send an alert if
 <emphasis>any</emphasis> changes are detected. Such tools should only be 
 installed on a known <quote>clean</quote> system. 

</para>

<para>
 For home desktops and home LANs, this is probably not an absolutely necessary
 component of an overall security strategy. But it does give peace of mind, and
 certainly does have its place. So as to priorities, make sure the Steps 1, 2
 and 3 above are implemented and verified to be sound, before delving into
 this.

</para>

<para>
 <![%linuxall;[<application>RPM</application> users]]><![%redhat;[We]]> can
 get somewhat the same results with <literal>rpm -Va</literal>, which will
 verify all packages, but without all the same functionality. For instance, it
 will not notice new files added to most directories. Nor will it detect 
 files that have had the extended attributes changed (e.g. <literal>chattr +i</literal>, 
 man <command>chattr</command> and man <command>lsattr</command>). For this to
 be helpful, it needs to be done after a clean install, and then each time any
 packages are upgraded or added. Example:

</para>

<para>
 <screen>
 
 # rpm -Va > /root/system.checked

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 Then we have a stored system snapshot that we can refer back to.

<para>
 Another idea is to run <command>chkrootkit</command>
 (<ulink url="http://www.chkrootkit.org/">http://www.chkrootkit.org/</ulink>)
 as a weekly cron job. This will detect common <quote>rootkits</quote>.

<title>Have I Been Hacked?</title>

<para>
 Maybe you are reading this because you've noticed something <quote>odd</quote> 
 about your system, and are suspicious that someone was gotten in? This can be
 a clue. 
</para>

<para>
 The first thing an intruder typically does is install a <quote>rootkit</quote>. 
 There are many prepackaged rootkits available on the Internet. 
 The rootkit is essentially a script, or set of scripts, that makes quick work
 of modifying the system so the intruder is in control, and he is well hidden.
 He does this by installing modified binaries of common system utilities and
 tampering with log files. Or by using special kernel modules that achieve
 similar results. So common commands like <command>ls</command> may be
 modified so as to not show where he has his files stored. Clever! 

</para>

<para>
 A well designed rootkit can be quite effective. Nothing on the system can
 really be trusted to provide accurate feedback. Nothing! But sometimes the
 modifications are not as smooth as intended and give hints that something is
 not right. Some things that <emphasis>might</emphasis> be warning signs:
</para>

<para>
 <itemizedlist>

 <listitem>
  <para>  
   <command>Login</command> acts weird. Maybe no one can login. Or only 
   root can login. Any <command>login</command> weirdness at all should be
   suspicious. Similarly, any weirdness with adding or changing passwords.
  </para>
  <para>
   Wierdness with other system commands (e.g. <command>top</command> or
   <command>ps</command>) should be cause for concern as well. 
  </para>
 </listitem>

 <listitem>
  <para>
   System utilities are slower, or awkward, or show strange and unexpected 
   results. Common utilities that might be modified are: <command>ls</command>, 
   <command>find</command>, <command>who</command>, <command>w</command>, 
   <command>last</command>, <command>netstat</command>,
   <command>login</command>, <command>ps</command>, <command>top</command>.
   This is not a definitive list!
  </para>
 </listitem> 

 <listitem>
  <para>
   Files or directories named <quote>...</quote> or <quote>.. </quote> 
   (dot dot space). A sure bet in this case. Files with haxor looking 
   names like <quote>r00t-something</quote>.
  </para>
 </listitem> 

 <listitem>
  <para>
   Unexplained bandwidth usage, or connections. Script kiddies have a fondness 
   for IRC, so such connections should raise a red flag.
  </para>
 </listitem> 

 <listitem>
  <para>
   Logs that are missing completely, or missing large sections. Or a sudden 
   change in <command>syslog</command> behavior.  
  </para>
 </listitem> 

 <listitem>
  <para>
    Mysterious open ports, or processes. 
  </para>
 </listitem> 

 <listitem>
  <para>
    Files that cannot be deleted or moved. Some rootkits use 
    <command>chattr</command> to make files <quote>immutable</quote>, 
    or not changable. This kind of change will not show up with
    <command>ls</command>, or <command>rpm -V</command>, so the files look
    normal at first glance. See the man pages for <command>chattr</command>
    and <command>lsattr</command> on how to reverse this. Then see the next
    section below on restoring your system as the jig is up at this point.
  </para>
  <para>
    This is becoming a more and more common script kiddie trick. In fact, one 
    quick test to run on a suspected system (as root):
  </para>
  <screen>
  /usr/bin/lsattr `echo $PATH | tr ':' ' '` | grep i--
  </screen>
  <para>
   This will look for any <quote>immutable</quote> files in root's
   <literal>PATH</literal>, which is almost surely a sign of trouble since 
   no standard distributions ship files in this state. If the above command 
   turns up <emphasis>anything at all</emphasis>, then plan on completely
   restoring the system (see below). A quick sanity check:
  </para>
  <screen>
  # chattr +i /bin/ps
  # /usr/bin/lsattr `echo $PATH | tr ':' ' '` | grep "i--"
    ---i---------- /bin/ps
  # chattr -i /bin/ps
  </screen>
  <para>
   This is just to verify the system is not tampered with to the point that
   <command>lsattr</command> is completely unreliable. The third line is 
   <emphasis>exactly</emphasis> what you should see. 
  </para>

 </listitem> 

 <listitem>
  <para>
   Indications of a <quote>sniffer</quote>, such as log messages of an 
   interface entering <quote>promiscuous</quote> mode.

   Modifications to <filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename>, 
   <filename>rc.local</filename>, <filename>rc.sysint</filename> or
   <filename>/etc/passwd</filename>. Especially, any additions. Try 
   using <command>cat</command> or <command>tail</command> to view these 
   files. Additions will most likely be appended to the end. Remember though
   such changes may not be <quote>visible</quote> to any system tools. 
  </para>
 </listitem> 

 </itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
 Sometimes the intruder is not so smart and forgets about root's 
 <filename>.bash_history</filename>, or cleaning up log entries, or even
 leaves strange, leftover files in <filename>/tmp</filename>. So these should
 always be checked too. Just don't necessarily expect them to be accurate. 
 Often such left behind files, or log entries, will have obvious 
 script kiddie sounding names, e.g. <quote>r00t.sh</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 Packet sniffers, like <application>tcpdump</application>
 (<ulink url="http://www.tcpdump.org">http://www.tcpdump.org</ulink>), might
 be useful in finding any uninvited traffic. Interpreting sniffer output is
 probably beyond the grasp of the average new user. <application>snort</application>  
 (<ulink url="http://www.snort.org">http://www.snort.org</ulink>), and 
 <application>ethereal</application>  
 (<ulink url="http://www.ethereal.com">http://www.ethereal.com</ulink>), are 
 also good. <application>Ethereal</application> has a GUI.

</para>

<para>
 As mentioned, a compromised system will undoubtedly have altered system
 binaries, and the output of system utilities is not to be trusted. Nothing on
 the system can be relied upon to be telling you the whole truth. Re-installing
 individual packages may or may not help since it could be system libraries
 or kernel modules that are doing the dirty work. The point here is that there
 is no way to know with absolute certainty exactly what components have been
 altered. 
</para>

<para>
 <![%linuxall;[<application>RPM</application> users]]> <![%redhat;[We]]> can
 use <literal>rpm -Va |less</literal> to attempt to verify the integrity all
 packages. But again there is no assurance that <application>rpm</application>
 itself has not been tampered with, or the system components that
 <application>RPM</application> relies on. 
</para>

<para>
 If you have <command>pstree</command> on your system, try this instead 
 of the standard <command>ps</command>. Sometimes the script kiddies forget
 about this one. No guarantees though that this is accurate either.
</para>

<para>
 You can also try querying the <filename>/proc</filename> filesystem, 
 which contains everything the kernel knows about processes that are 
 running:

</para>

<para>
 <screen>
 
 # cat /proc/*/stat | awk '{print $1,$2}'
 
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 This will provide a list of all processes and PID numbers (assuming 
 a malicious kernel module is not hiding this).
</para>

<para> 
 Another approach is to visit <ulink

 their rootkit checker, and see what it says.

 There is no sure fire way of doing this short of a complete re-install. There

Password Protection 101

Remembering long passwords can be difficult, but there are some basic
techniques users can employ to lessen the pain. First, choose a phrase that
you will remember. As an example, we will use the phrase "The pearl in the
river." You can then take a number that you are familiar with, such as a
birthday. For this example we will use 7/4/01. Next, you can take the first
letter of your phrase and interlace it with the chosen date to make
something similar to t7p4i0t1r. This method creates a password that won't be
found in any dictionary and is unique to the person who created it.

   constitute anything but a very rudimentary firewall. And if holes are
   opened, there is still exposure. Also, you are relying on the router's

   Be familiar with whatever services you are running, and the implications

   installer put it there. You can't start out being an experienced System
   Administrator clearly. But you can work to learn enough about your own
   system, that you are in control. This is one thing that separates *nix from
   MS systems: we can never be in complete control with MS, but we can with
   *nix. Conversely, if something bad happens, we often have no one else to

 Let's take a quick, non-technical look at some networking concepts, and how
 they can potentially impact our own security. We don't need to know much
 about networking, but a general idea of how things work is certainly going to
 help us with firewalls and other related issues.
</para>

<para>
 As you may have noticed Linux is a very network oriented Operating System. 
 Much is done by connecting to <quote>servers</quote> of one type or another
 -- X servers, font servers, print servers, etc. 

</para>

<para>
 Servers provide <quote>services</quote>, which provide various capabilities,
 both to the local system and potentially other remote systems. The same
 server generally provides both functionalities. Some servers
 work quietly behind the scenes, and others are more interactive by nature. We
 may only be aware of a print server when we need to print something, but it
 is there running, listening, and waiting for connection requests whether we
 ever use it or not (assuming of course we have it enabled). A typical Linux
 installation will have many, many types of servers available to it. Default 
 installations often will turn some of these <quote>on</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 And even if we are not connected to a real network all the time, we are still
 <quote>networked</quote> so to speak. Take our friendly local X server for
 instance. We may tend to think of this as just providing a GUI interface,
 which is only true to a point. It does this by <quote>serving</quote> to
 client applications, and thus is truly a server. But X Windows is also
 capable of serving remote clients over a network -- even large networks like
 the Internet. Though we probably don't really want to be doing this ;-)
</para>

<para>
 And yes, if you are not running a firewall or have not taken other
 precautions, and are connected to the Internet, it is quite possible that
 someone -- anyone -- could connect to your X server. X11
 <quote>listens</quote> on TCP <quote>port</quote> 6000 by default. This 
 principle applies to most other servers as well -- they can be easily 
 connected to, unless something is done to restrict or prevent connections.
</para>

<para>
 In TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) networks like we
 are talking about with Linux and the Internet, every connected computer 
 has a unique <quote>IP Address</quote>. Think of this like a phone number. 
 You have a phone number, and in order to call someone else, you have to know
 that phone number, and then dial it. The phone numbers have to be unique for
 the system to work. IP address are generally expressed as <quote>dotted
 quad</quote> notation, e.g. 152.19.254.81.

</para>

<para>
 On this type of network, servers are said to <quote>listen</quote>. This
 means that they have a <quote>port</quote> opened, and are awaiting incoming
 connections to that port. Connections may be local, as is typically the case
 with our X server, or remote -- meaning from another computer
 <quote>somewhere</quote>. So servers <quote>listen</quote> on a specific
 <quote>port</quote> for incoming connections. Most servers have a default
 port, such as port 80 for web servers. Or 6000 for X11. See 
 <filename>/etc/services</filename> for a list of common ports and their 
 associated service.

</para>

<para>
 The <quote>port</quote> is actually just an address in the kernel's 
 networking stack, and is a method that TCP, and other protocols, use to
 organize connections and the exchange of data between computers. There are
 total of 65,536 TCP and UDP ports available, though usually only a relatively
 few of these are used at any one time. These are classified as
 <quote>privileged</quote>, those ports below 1024, and
 <quote>unprivileged</quote>, 1024 and above. Most servers use the privileged
 ports. 
</para>

<para>
 Only one server may listen on, or <quote>bind</quote> to, a port at a time.
 Though that server may well be able to open multiple connections via that one
 port. Computers talk to each other via these <quote>port</quote> connections.
 One computer will open a connection to a <quote>port</quote> on another
 computer, and thus be able to exchange data via the connection that has been
 established between their respective ports. 
</para>

<para>
 Getting back to the phone analogy, and stretching it a bit, think of calling 
 a large organization with a complex phone system. The organization has many 
 <quote>departments</quote>: sales, shipping, billing, receiving, customer
 service, R&amp;D, etc. Each department has it's own <quote>extension</quote>
 number. So the shipping department might be extension 21, the sales might be
 department 80 and so on. The main phone number is the IP Address, and the
 department's extension is the port in this analogy. The
 <quote>department's</quote> number is always the same when we call. And
 generally they can handle many simultaneous incoming calls.
 
</para>

<para>
 The data itself is contained in <quote>packets</quote>, which are small
 chunks of data, generally 1500 bytes or less each. Packets are used to
 control and organize the connection, as well as carry data. There are
 different types of packets. Some are specifically used for controlling the
 connection, and then some packets carry our data as their payload. If
 there is a lot of data, it will be broken up into multiple packets which is
 almost always how it works. The packets will be transmitted one at a time,
 and then <quote>re-assembled</quote> at the other end. One web page for
 instance, will take many packets to transmit -- maybe hundreds or even
 thousands. This all happens very quickly and transparently.

</para>

<para>
 We can see a typical connection between two computers in this one line
 excerpt from <command>netstat</command> output:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 tcp    30    0 169.254.179.139:1359    18.29.1.67:21      CLOSE_WAIT

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 The interesting part is the IP addresses and ports in the fourth and fifth 
 columns. The port is the number just to the right of the colon. The left side
 of the colon is the IP address of each computer. The fourth column is the
 local address, or our end of the connection. In the example, 169.254.179.139
 is the IP address assigned by my ISP. It is connected to port 21
 (FTP) on 18.29.1.67, which is rpmfind.net. This is just after an FTP download
 from rpmfind.net. Note that while I am connected to their FTP server on their
 port 21, the port on my end that is used by my FTP client is 1359. This is a
 randomly assigned <quote>unprivileged</quote> port, used for my end of the
 two-way <quote>conversation</quote>. The data moves in both directions:
 me:port#1359 &lt;-&gt; them:port#21. The FTP protocol is actually a little
 more complicated than this, but we won't delve into the finer points here.
 The <literal>CLOSE_WAIT</literal> is the TCP state of the connection at this 
 particular point in time. Eventually the connection will close completely on
 both ends, and <application>netstat</application> will not show anything for
 this. 
 
</para>

<para>
 The <quote>unprivileged</quote> port that is used for my end of the
 connection, is temporary and is not associated with a locally running server.
 It will be closed by the kernel when the connection is terminated. This is
 quite different than the ports that are kept open by <quote>listening</quote>
 servers, which are permanent and remain <quote>open</quote> even after a
 remote connection is terminated.
</para>

<para>
 So to summarize using the above example, we have client (me) connecting 
 to a server (rpmfind.net), and the connection is defined and controlled by
 the respective ports on either end. The data is transmitted and controlled by
 packets. The server is using a <quote>privileged</quote> port (i.e. a port
 below number 1024) which stays open listening for connections. The
 <quote>unprivileged</quote> port used on my end by my client application is
 temporary, is only opened for the duration of the connection, and only
 responds to the server's port at the other end of the connection. This type
 of port is not vulnerable to attacks or break-ins generally speaking. The
 server's port is vulnerable since it remains open. The administrator of the
 FTP server will need to take appropriate precautions that his server is
 secure. Other Internet connections, such as to web servers or mail servers,
 work similar to the above example, though the server ports are different. 
 SMTP mail servers use port 25, and web servers typically use port 80. 
 See the <link linkend="ports">Ports section</link> for other commonly used 
 ports and services.
</para>

<para>
 One more point on ports: ports are only accessible if there is something 
 listening on that port. No one can force a port open if there is no service
 or daemon listening there, ready to handle incoming connection requests. 
 A closed port is a totally safe port. 
 
</para>

<para>
 And a final point on the distinction between clients and servers. The example
 above did not have a <command>telnet</command> or <command>ftp</command> 
 server in the <literal>LISTENER</literal> section in the
 <command>netstat</command> example above. In other words, no such servers 
 were running locally. You do not need to run a <command>telnet</command> or
 <command>ftp</command> server daemon in order to connect to
 <emphasis>somebody else's</emphasis> <command>telnet</command> or
 <command>ftp</command> server. These are only for providing these services
 to others that would be making connections to you. Which you don't really
 want to be doing in most cases. This in no way effects the ability to use 
 <command>telnet</command> and <command>ftp</command> client software.

 Another point here, these are the <emphasis>standard</emphasis> port

 Just a reminder that when you see these types of ports in your firewall logs,
 it is not anything to go off the deep end about. Not if you have followed
 Steps 1-3 above, and verified your firewall works. You are fairly safe. Much
 of this traffic may be <quote>stray bullets</quote> too -- Internet
 background noise, misconfigured clients or routers, noisy Windows stuff, etc.

<title>Overview</title>

<para>
 <command>netstat</command> is a very useful utility for viewing 
 the current state of your network status -- what servers are listening for
 incoming connections, what interfaces they listen on, who is connected to us,
 who we are connect to, and so on. Take a look at the man page for some of the
 many command line options. We'll just use a relative few options here.

</para>

<para>
 As an example, let's check all currently listening servers and active
 connections for both TCP and UDP on our hypothetical host,
 bigcat. bigcat is a home desktop installation, with a DSL
 Internet connection in this example. bigcat has two ethernet cards: one for
 the external connection to the ISP, and one for a small LAN with an address
 of 192.168.1.1.

<para>
 This output probably looks very different from what you get on your own 
 system. Notice the distinction between <quote>Local Address</quote> and
 <quote>Foreign Address</quote>, and how each includes a corresponding port
 number (or service name if available) after the colon. <quote>Local
 Address</quote> is our end of the connection. The first group with
 <literal>LISTEN</literal> in the far right hand column are services that are
 running on this system. These are servers that are running in the background 
 on bigcat, and <quote>listen</quote> for incoming connections. So they 
 have a port opened, and this is where they <quote>listen</quote>. These
 connections might come from the local system (i.e. bigcat itself), or remote
 systems. This is very important information to have! The others just below
 this are connections that have been established from this system to other
 systems. The respective connections are in varying states as indicated by the
 key words in the last column. Those with no key word in the last column at
 the end are servers responding to UDP connections. UDP is a different
 protocol from TCP altogether, but is used for some types of low priority
 network traffic.

 Now, the same thing with the <quote>-n</quote> flag to suppress converting to
 <quote>names</quote> so we can actually see the port numbers:

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 Let's look at the first few lines of this in detail. On line one, 
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:515            0.0.0.0:*          LISTEN     

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 <quote>Local Address</quote> is <literal>0.0.0.0</literal>, meaning
 <quote>all</quote> interfaces that are available. The local port is 515, or the
 standard print server port, usually owned by the lpd daemon. You can find a
 listing of common service names and corresponding ports in the file 
 <filename>/etc/services</filename>. 
</para>

<para>
 The fact that it is listening on all interfaces is significant. In this case,
 that would be lo (localhost), eth0, and eth1. Printer connections could
 conceivably be made over any of these interfaces. Should a user on this system
 bring up a PPP connection, then the print daemon would be listening on that
 interface (ppp0) as well. The <quote>Foreign Address</quote> is also
 <literal>0.0.0.0</literal>, meaning from <quote>anywhere</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 It is also worth noting here, that even though this server is telling the
 kernel to listen on all interfaces, the <command>netstat</command> output
 does not reflect whether there may be a firewall in place that may be
 filtering incoming connections. We just can't tell that at this point.
 Obviously, for certain servers, this is very desirable. Nobody outside your
 own LAN has any reason whatsoever to connect to your print server port for
 instance.
</para>

<para>
 Line two is a little different:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:8000         0.0.0.0:*          LISTEN     

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 Notice the <quote>Local Address</quote> this time is localhost's address 
 of <literal>127.0.0.1</literal>. This is very significant as only connections 
 local to this machine will be accepted. So only bigcat can connect to
 bigcat's TCP port 8000. The security implications should be obvious. Not all 
 servers have configuration options that allow this kind of restriction, but 
 it is a very useful feature for those that do. Port 8000 in this example, 
 is owned by the web proxy <application>Junkbuster</application>.

</para>

<para>
 With the next three entries, we are back to listening on all available 
 interfaces:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:37             0.0.0.0:*           LISTEN     
 tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:6000           0.0.0.0:*           LISTEN
 tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80             0.0.0.0:*           LISTEN     

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 Looking at <filename>/etc/services</fileName>, we can tell that port 37 
 is a <quote>time</quote> service, which is a time server. 
 6000 is <application>X11</application>, and 80 is the standard port for HTTP
 servers like <application>Apache</application>. There is nothing really
 unusual here as these are all readily available services on Linux.
</para>

<para>
 The first two above are definitely not the kind of services you'd want just
 anyone to connect to. These should be firewalled so that all outside
 connections are refused. Again, we can't tell from this output whether any
 firewall is in place, much less how effectively implemented it may be.
</para>

<para>
 The web server on port 80 is not a huge security risk by itself. HTTP is a
 protocol that is often open to all comers. For instance, if we wanted to host
 our own home page, <application>Apache</application> can certainly do this
 for us. It is also possible to firewall this off, so that it is for use only
 to our LAN clients as part of an Intranet. Obviously too, if you do not have
 a good justification for running a web server, then it should be disabled 
 completely.
 
</para>

<para>
 The next two lines are interesting:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 tcp        0      0 192.168.1.1:53         0.0.0.0:*           LISTEN     
 tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:53           0.0.0.0:*           LISTEN     

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 Again notice the <quote>Local Address</quote> is not <literal>0.0.0.0</literal>. 
 This is good! The port this time is 53, or the DNS port used by nameserver
 daemons like <command>named.</command> But we see the nameserver
 daemon is only listening on the lo interface (localhost), and the interface
 that connects bigcat to the LAN. So the kernel only allows connections from
 localhost, and the LAN. There will be no port 53 available to outside
 connections at all. This is a good example of how individual applications 
 can sometimes be securely configured. In this case, we are probably looking 
 at a caching DNS server since a real nameserver that is responsible for 
 handling DNS queries would have to have port 53 open to the world. This 
 is a security risk and requires special handling.
 
</para>

<para>
 The last three <literal>LISTENER</literal> entries:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22             0.0.0.0:*           LISTEN     
 tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:631            0.0.0.0:*           LISTEN     
 tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:25             0.0.0.0:*           LISTEN     

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 These are back to listening on all available interfaces. Port 22 is
 <application>sshd</application>, the Secure Shell server daemon. This is a good
 sign! Notice that the service for port 631 does not have a service name if we
 look at the output in the first example. This might be a clue that something
 unusual is going on here. (See the next section for the answer to this
 riddle.) And lastly, port 25, the standard port for the SMTP mail daemon.
 Most Linux installations probably will have an SMTP daemon running, so this
 is not necessarily unusual. But is it necessary?
</para>

<para>
 The next grouping is established connections. For our purposes the state of 
 the connection as indicated by the last column is not so important. This is 
 well explained in the man page.

<para>
 There are nine total connections here. The first three is our external
 interface connecting to a remote host on their port 119, the standard NNTP (News) 
 port. There are three connections here to the same news server. Apparently 
 the application is multi-threaded, as it is trying to open multiple
 connections to the news server. The next two entries are connections to a
 remote web server as indicated by the port 80 after the colon in the fifth
 column. Probably a pretty common looking entry for most of us. But the one
 just after is reversed and has the port 80 in the fourth column, so this is
 someone that has connected to bigcat's web server via its external,
 Internet-side interface. The last three entries are all connections from
 localhost to localhost. So we are connecting to ourselves here. Remembering
 from above that port 8000 is bigcat's web proxy, this is a web browser that
 is connected to the locally running proxy. The proxy then will open an
 external connection of its own, which probably is what is going on with lines
 four and five.
</para>

<para>
 Since we gave <command>netstat</command> both the <literal>-t</literal> and 
 <literal>-u</literal> options, we are getting both the TCP and UDP listening 
 servers. The last few lines are the UDP ones:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:32768          0.0.0.0:*                    
 udp        0      0 192.168.1.1:53         0.0.0.0:*                      
 udp        0      0 127.0.0.1:53           0.0.0.0:*                     
 udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:631            0.0.0.0:*          

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 The last three entries have ports that are familiar from the above
 discussion. These are servers that are listening for both TCP and UDP 
 connections. Same servers in this case, just using two different protocols.
 The first one on local port 32768 is new, and does not have a service name
 available to it in <filename>/etc/services</filename>. So at first glance
 this should be suspicious and pique our curiosity. See the next section for
 the explanation.
</para>

<para>
 Can we draw any conclusions from this hypothetical situation? For 
 the most part, these look to be pretty normal looking network services and 
 connections for Linux. There does not seem to be an unduly high number of
 servers running here, but that by itself does not mean much since we don't
 know if all these servers are really required or not. We know that
 <command>netstat</command> can not tell us if any of these are effectively
 firewalled, so there is no way to say how secure all this might be. We also
 don't really know if all the listening services are really required by the
 owner here. That is something that varies widely from installation to
 installation. Does bigcat even have a printer attached for instance?
 Presumably it does, or this is a completely unnecessary risk.

<title>Port and Process Owners</title>

<para>
 We've learned a lot about what is going on with bigcat's networking from 
 the above section. But suppose we see something we don't recognize and 
 want to know what started that particular service? Or we want to stop a
 particular server and it is not obvious from the above output?
</para>

<para>
 The <literal>-p</literal> option should give us the process's PID and the 
 program name that started the process in the last column. Let's look at the
 TCP servers again (with first three columns cropped for spacing). We'll have
 to run this as root to get all the available information:

</para>

<para>
 <screen>

# netstat -tap

</para>

<para>
 Some of these we already know about. But we see now that the printer daemon
 on port 515 is being started via <command>inetd</command> with a 
 PID of <quote>988</quote>. <command>inetd</command> is a special situation.
 <command>inetd</command> is often called the <quote>super server</quote>,
 since it's main role is to spawn sub-services. <![%redhat;[
 <application>xinetd</application> replaces <application>inetd</application>
 as of Red Hat 7.0. ]]> If we look at the first line, <command>inetd</command>
 is listening on port 515 for printer services. If a connection comes for this
 port, <command>inetd</command> intercepts it, and then will spawn the
 appropriate daemon, i.e. the print daemon in this case. The configuration of
 how <command>inetd</command> handles this is typically done in
 <filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename>. This should tell us that if we want to
 stop an <command>inetd</command> controlled server on a permanent basis, then
 we will have to dig into the <command>inetd</command> (or perhaps
 <command>xinetd</command>) configuration. Also the time service above is
 started via <command>inetd</command> as well. This should also tell us that
 these two services can be further protected by
 <application>tcpwrappers</application> (discussed in Step 3 above). This is
 one benefit of using <command>inetd</command> to control certain system
 services.

</para>

<para>
 We weren't sure about the service on port 631 above since it did not have 
 a standard service name, which means it is something maybe unusual or off 
 the beaten path. Now we see it is owned by <command>cupsd</command> 
 <![%redhat;[ (not included with Red Hat by the way)]]>, which is one of
 several print daemons available under Linux. This happens to be the web
 interface for controlling the printer service. Something
 <command>cupsd</command> does that is indeed a little different than other
 print servers. 

</para>

<para>
 The last entry above is the SMTP mail server on bigcat. Often, this is 
 <command>sendmail</command><![%linuxall;[ with many distributions]]>. But
 not in this case. The command is <quote>master</quote>, which may not ring
 any bells. Armed with the program name we could go searching the filesystem
 with tools like the <command>locate</command> or <command>find</command>
 commands. After we found it, we could then probably discern what package it
 belonged to. But with the PID available now, we can look at
 <command>ps</command> output, and see if that helps us any:

</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 $ /bin/ps ax |grep 1051 |grep -v grep
  1051 ?        S        0:24 /usr/libexec/postfix/master

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 We took a shortcut here by combining <command>ps</command> with
 <command>grep</command>. It looks like that this file belongs to  
 <command>postfix</command>, which is indeed a mail server package 
 comparable to <command>sendmail</command><![%redhat;[ ( and is  
 included with Powertools, not the base distribution)]]>. 

</para>

<para>
 Running <command>ps</command> with the <literal>--forest</literal> flag 
 (<literal>-f</literal> for short) can be helpful in determining what
 processes are parent or child process or another process. An edited example:
 
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 $ /bin/ps -axf
  956 ?        S      0:00 named -u named
  957 ?        S      0:00  \_ named -u named

 2062 ?        S      0:00  \_ smtpd -n smtp -t inet -u -c

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 A couple of things to note here. We have two by now familiar daemons here: 
 <command>named</command> and <command>postfix (smtpd)</command>. Both 
 are spawning sub-processes. In the case of <command>named</command>, what we are
 seeing is threads, various sub-processes that it always spawns. 
 <command>Postfix</command> is also spawning sub-processes, but not as 
 <quote>threads</quote>. Each sub-process has its own specific task. It is 
 worth noting that child processes are dependent on the parent process. 
 So killing the parent PID, will in turn kill all child processes. 
 
</para>

<para>
 If all this has not shed any light, we might also try <command>locate</command>:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 $ locate /master
 /etc/postfix/master.cf
 /var/spool/postfix/pid/master.pid
 /usr/libexec/postfix/master
 /usr/share/vim/syntax/master.vim
 /usr/share/vim/vim60z/syntax/master.vim
 /usr/share/doc/postfix-20010202/html/master.8.html
 /usr/share/doc/postfix-20010202/master.cf
 /usr/share/man/man8/master.8.gz

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 <command>find</command> is perhaps the most flexible file finding utility, 
 but doesn't use a database the way <command>locate</command> does, so is 
 much slower:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 $ find / -name master         
 /usr/libexec/postfix/master

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 If <command>lsof</command> is installed, it is another command that is useful
 for finding who owns processes or ports:

</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 # lsof -i :631       
 COMMAND  PID  USER    FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME
 cupsd   1315  root    0u   IPv4   3734       TCP *:631 (LISTEN)

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 This is again telling us that the <command>cupsd</command> print daemon is
 the owner of port 631. Just a different way of getting at it. Yet one more
 way to get at this is with <command>fuser</command>, which should be
 installed:

</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 # fuser -v -n tcp 631

                      USER        PID  ACCESS  COMMAND
 631/tcp              root       1315  f....   cupsd

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 See the man pages for <command>fuser</command> and <command>lsof</command> 
 command syntax.

</para>

<para>
 Another place to look for where a service is started, is in the
 <filename>init.d</filename> directory, where the actual init scripts
 live<![%linuxall;[ (for SysVinit systems)]]>. Something like <literal>ls -l
 /etc/<![%redhat;[rc.d/]]>init.d/</literal>, should give us a list of these.
 Often the script name itself gives a hint as to which service(s) it starts,
 though it may not necessarily exactly match the <quote>Program Name</quote>
 as provided by <command>netstat</command>. Or we can use
 <command>grep</command> to search inside files and match a search pattern.
 Need to find where <command>rpc.statd</command> is being started, and we
 don't see a script by this name?

</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 # grep rpc.statd /etc/init.d/*
 /etc/init.d/nfslock: [ -x /sbin/rpc.statd ] || exit 0
 /etc/init.d/nfslock:    daemon rpc.statd
 /etc/init.d/nfslock:    killproc rpc.statd
 /etc/init.d/nfslock:    status rpc.statd
 /etc/init.d/nfslock:    /sbin/pidof rpc.statd &gt;/dev/null 2>&amp;1; STATD="$?"

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 We didn't really need all that information, but at least we see now 
 exactly which script is starting it. Remember too that not all services 
 are started this way. Some may be started via <application>inetd</application>, 
 or <application>xinetd</application>.

</para>

<para>
 The <filename>/proc</filename> filesystem also keeps everything we want 
 to know about processes that are running. We can query this to find out 
 more information about each process. Do you need to know the full path of the
 command that started a process?

</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 # ls -l /proc/1315/exe
 lrwxrwxrwx  1 root  root   0 July 4 19:41 /proc/1315/exe -> /usr/sbin/cupsd

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 Finally, we had a loose end or two in the UDP listening services. Remember we
 had a strange looking port number 32768, that also had no service name 
 associated with it:

</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 # netstat -aup
 Active Internet connections (servers and established)
  Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name   
   *:32768                 *:*                                 956/named           
   bigcat:domain           *:*                                 956/named           
   bigcat:domain           *:*                                 956/named           
   *:631                   *:*                                 1315/cupsd          

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
  Now by including the <quote>PID/Program name</quote>
 option with the <literal>-p</literal> flag, we see this also belongs to
 <command>named</command>, the nameserver daemon. Recent versions of
 <application>BIND</application> use an unprivileged port for some types 
 of traffic. In this case, this is <application>BIND 9.x</application>. 
 So no real alarms here either. The unprivileged port here is the one 
 <command>named</command> uses to talk to other nameservers for name 
 and address lookups, and should not be firewalled. 

</para>

<para>
 So we found no big surprises in this hypothetical situation.
</para>

<para>
 If all else fails, and you can't find a process owner for an open port,
 suspect that it may be an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) service of some kind.
 These use randomly assigned ports without any seeming logic or consistency,
 and are typically controlled by the <command>portmap</command> daemon. 
 In some cases, these may not reveal the process owner to
 <command>netstat</command> or <command>lsof</command>. Try stopping
 <command>portmap</command>, and then see if the mystery service goes away. Or
 you can use <command>rpcinfo -p localhost</command> to see what RPC services
 may be running (<command>portmap</command> must be running for this to
 work).
</para>

 <warning>
  <para>
   If you suspect you have been broken into, <emphasis>do not trust</emphasis> 
   <command>netstat</command> or <command>ps</command> output. There is a good
   chance that they, and other system components, has been tampered with in
   such a way that the output is not reliable.

<sect2 id="threats">
<title>Attacks and Threats</title>

<para>
 In this section, we will take a quick look at some of the common threats 
 and techniques that are out there, and attempt to put them into some 
 perspective.
</para>

<para>
 The corporate world, government agencies and high profile Internet sites have
 to be concerned with a much more diverse and challenging set of threats than
 the typical home desktop user. There are many reasons someone may want to
 break in to someone else's computer. It may be just for kicks, or any number
 of malicious reasons. They may just want a base from which to attack 
 someone else. This is a very common motivation.
 
</para>

<para>
 The most common <quote>attack</quote> for most of us is from already
 compromised systems. The Internet is littered with computers that have been
 broken into, and are now doing their master's bidding blindly, in zombie-like
 fashion. They are programmed to scan massively large address ranges, probing
 each individual IP address as they go. Looking for one or more open ports,
 and then probing for known weaknesses if they get the chance. Very
 impersonal. Very methodical. And very effective. We are all in the path of
 such robotic scans. All because those responsible for these systems fail to
 do what you are doing now - taking steps to protect their system(s), and
 avoid being r00ted.

</para>

<para>
 These scans do not look at login banners that may be presented on connection.
 It will do little good to change your <filename>/etc/issue.net</filename> to
 pretend that you are running some obscure operating system. If they find
 something listening, they will try all of the exploits appropriate to that
 port, without regard to any indications your system may give. If it works,
 they are in -- if not, they will move on.

</para>



<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->

<sect3 id="scans">
<title>Port Scans and Probes</title>

<para>
 First, let's define <quote>scan</quote> and <quote>probe</quote> since these 
 terms come up quite a bit. A <quote>probe</quote> implies testing if a given
 port is open or closed, and possibly what might be listening on that port. A
 <quote>scan</quote> implies either <quote>probing</quote> multiple ports on
 one or more systems. Or individual ports on multiple systems. So you might 
 <quote>scan</quote> all ports on your own system for instance. Or a 
 cracker might <quote>scan</quote> the 216.78.*.* address range to see who
 has port 111 open. 
 
</para>

<para>
 Black hats can use scan and probe information to know what services are
 running on a given system, and then they might know what exploits to try.
 They may even be able to tell what Operating System is running, and even
 kernel version, and thus get even more information. <quote>Worms</quote>, on
 the other hand, are automated and scan blindly, generally just looking for
 open ports, and then a susceptible victim. They are not trying to
 <quote>learn</quote> anything, the way a cracker might.

</para>

<para>
 The distinction between <quote>scan</quote> and <quote>probe</quote>is often
 blurred.  Both can used in good ways, or in bad ways, depending on who is
 doing it, and why.  You might ask a friend to scan you, for instance, to see
 how well your firewall is working. This is a legitimate use of scanning tools
 such as <application>nmap</application>. But what if someone you don't know
 does this? What is their intent? If it's your ISP, they may be trying to
 enforce their Terms of Service Agreement. Or maybe, it is someone just
 playing, and seeing who is <quote>out there</quote>. But more than likely it
 is someone or something with not such good intentions.

</para>

<para>
 Full range port scans (meaning probing of many ports on the same machine)
 seem to be a not so common threat for home based networks. But certainly, 
 scanning individual ports across numerous systems is a very, very common 
 occurrence.
 
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Rootkits</title>


<para>
 A <quote>rootkit</quote> is the script kiddie's stock in trade. When a
 successful intrusion takes place, the first thing that is often done, is to
 download and install such <quote>rootkits</quote>. The rootkit is a set of
 scripts designed to take control of the system, and then hide the intrusion.
 Rootkits are readily available on the web for various Operating Systems. 

</para>

<para>
 A rootkit will typically replace critical system files such as 
 <command>ls</command>, <command>ps</command>, <command>netstat</command>, 
 <command>login</command> and others. Passwords may be added, hidden 
 daemons started, logs tampered with, and surely one of more backdoors are
 opened. The hidden backdoors allow easy access any time the attacker wants
 back in. And often the vulnerability itself may even be fixed so that the new
 <quote>owner</quote> has the system all to himself. The entire process is
 scripted so it happens very quickly. The rightful owners of these compromised
 systems generally have no idea what is going on, and are victims themselves.
 A well designed rootkit can be very difficult to detect.

</para>

<sect3>
<title>Worms and Zombies</title>

<para>
 A <quote>worm</quote> is a self replicating exploit. It infects a system, 
 then attempts to spread itself typically via the same vulnerability. Various
 <quote>worms</quote> are weaving their way through the entire Internet
 address space constantly, spreading themselves as they go.

</para>

<para>
 But somewhere behind the zombie, there is a controller. Someone launched 
 the worm, and they will be informed after a successful intrusion. It is 
 then up to them how the system will be used.
 
</para>

<para>
 Many of these are Linux systems, looking for other Linux systems to
 <quote>infect</quote> via a number of exploits. But most Operating Systems
 share in this threat. Once a vulnerable system is found, the actual entry
 and take over is quick, and may be difficult to detect after the fact. The
 first thing an intruder (whether human or <quote>worm</quote>) will do is
 attempt to cover their tracks. A <quote>rootkit</quote> is downloaded and
 installed. This trend has been exacerbated by the growing popularity of cable
 modems and DSL. The number of full time Internet connections is growing
 rapidly, and this makes fertile ground for such exploits since often 
 these aren't as well secured as larger sites. 

</para>

<para>
 While this may sound ominous, a few simple precautions can effectively
 deter this type of attack. With so many easy victims out there, why waste much
 effort breaking into <Emphasis>your</Emphasis> system? There is no incentive
 to really try very hard. Just scan, look, try, move on if unsuccessful. There
 is always more IPs to be scanned. If your firewall is effectively bouncing
 this kind of thing, it is no threat to you at all. Take comfort in that, 
 and don't over re-act.

</para>

<para>
 It is worth noting, that these worms cannot <quote>force</quote> their way
 in. They need an open and accessible port, <emphasis>and</emphasis> a known
 vulnerability. If you remember the <quote>Iptables Weekly Log Summary</quote>
 in the opening section above, many of those may have all been the result of
 this type of scan. If you've followed the steps in this HOWTO, you should be
 reasonably safe here. This one is easy enough to deflect.

<title>Script Kiddies</title>

<para>
 A <quote>script kiddie</quote> is a <quote>cracker</quote> wanna be who 
 doesn't know enough to come up with his/her own exploits, but instead 
 relies on <quote>scripts</quote> and exploits that have been developed by
 others. Like <quote>worms</quote>, they are looking for easy victims, 
 and may similarly scan large address ranges looking for specific ports 
 with known vulnerabilities. Often, the actual scanning is done from  
 already comprised systems so that it is difficult to trace it back to them.

</para>

<para>
 The script kiddie has a bag of ready made tricks at his disposal, including 
 an arsenal of <quote>rootkits</quote> for various Operating Systems. Finding 
 susceptible victims is not so hard, given enough time and address space to
 probe. The motives are a mixed bag as well. Simple mischief, defacement 
 of web sites, stolen credit card numbers, and the latest craze, 
 <quote>Denial of Service</quote> attacks (see below). They collect 
 zombies like trophies and use them to carry out whatever their objective is.

</para>

<para>
 Again, the key here is that they are following a <quote>script</quote>, and 
 looking for easy prey. Like the worm threat above, a functional firewall 
 and a few very basic precautions, should be sufficient to deflect any 
 threat here. By now, you should be relatively safe from this nuisance.

</para>

</sect3>

<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->

<sect3>
<title>Spoofed IPs</title>

<para>
 How easy is it to spoof an IP address? With the right tools, very easy. How
 much of a threat is this? Not much, for most of us, and is over-hyped as a 
 threat.

</para>

<para>
 Because of the way TCP/IP works, each packet must carry both the source and
 destination IP addresses. Any return traffic is based on this information. So
 a spoofed IP can never return any useful information to an attacker who is
 sending out spoofed packets. The traffic would go back to wherever that
 spoofed IP address was pointed. The attacker gets nothing back at all.

</para>

<para>
 This does have potential for <quote>DoS</quote> attacks (see below) where 
 learning something about the targeted system is not important. And may be 
 used for some general mischief making as well.

</para>

</sect3>

<!--  ~  End section  ~  -->




<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->

<sect3>
<title>Targeted Attacks</title>

<para>
 The worm and wide ranging address type scans, are impersonal. They are just
 looking for any vulnerable system. It makes no difference whether it is a top
 secret government facility, or your mother's Window's box. But there are 
 <quote>black hats</quote> that will spend a great deal of effort to get into 
 a system or network.  We'll call these <quote>targeted</quote> attacks since 
 there has been a deliberate decision made to break in to a specific system 
 or network.
 
</para>

<para>
 In this case, the attacker will look the system over for weaknesses. And
 possibly make many different kinds of attempts, until he finds a crack to
 wiggle through. Or gives up. This is more difficult to defend against. The
 attacker is armed and dangerous, so to speak, and is stalking his prey. 

</para>

<para>
 Again, this scenario is very unlikely for a typical home system. There just
 generally isn't any incentive to take the time and effort when there are
 bigger fish to fry. For those who may be targets, the best defense here
 includes many of things we've discussed. Vigilance is probably more important
 than ever. Good logging practices and an IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
 should be in place. And subscribing to one or more security related mailing
 lists like BUGTRAQ. And of course, reading those alerts daily, and taking
 the appropriate actions, etc. 
 
</para>

</sect3>

<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->


<sect3 id="dos">
<title>Denial of Service (DoS)</title>

<para>
 <quote>DoS</quote> is another type of <quote>attack</quote> in which the
 intention is to disrupt or overwhelm the targeted system or network in such a
 way that it cannot function normally. DoS can take many forms. On the
 Internet, this often means overwhelming the victim's bandwidth or TCP/IP
 stack, by sending floods of packets and thus effectively disabling the
 connection. We are talking about many, many packets per second. Thousands in
 some cases. Or perhaps, the objective is to crash a server.

</para>

<para>
 This is much more likely to be targeted at organizations or high profile
 sites, than home users. And can be quite challenging to stop depending 
 on the technique. And it generally requires the co-operation of 
 networks between the source(s) and the target, so that the floods are
 stopped, or minimized, before they reach the targeted destination. Once they
 hit the destination, there is no good way to completely ignore them. 

</para>

<para>
 <quote>DDoS</quote>, Distributed Denial of Service, is where multiple sources
 are used to maximize the impact. Again, not likely to be directly targeted at
 home users. These are <quote>slaves</quote> that are <quote>owned</quote> 
 by a cracker, or script kiddie, that are woken up and are targeted at the 
 victim. There may be many computers involved in the attack.
 
</para>

<para>
 If you are home user, and with a dynamic IP address, you might find
 disconnecting, then re-connecting to get a new IP, an effective way out 
 if you are the target. Maybe.
 
</para>


</sect3>

<!--  ~  End section  ~  -->



<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->

<sect3>
<title>Brute Force</title>

<para>
 <quote>Brute force</quote> attacks are where the attacker makes repetitive
 attempts at the same perceived weakness(es). Like a battering ram. A classic
 example would be where someone tries to access a
 <application>telnet</application> server simply by continually throwing
 passwords at it, hoping that one will eventually work. Or maybe crash the
 server. This doesn't require much imagination, and is not a commonly used
 tactic against home systems.
 
</para>

<para>
 By the way, this is one good argument against allowing remote root logins. 
 The root account exists on all systems. It is probably the only one that this
 is true of. You'd like to make a potential attacker guess both the login 
 name <emphasis>and</emphasis> password. But if root is allowed remote logins, 
 then the attacker only needs to guess the password!

<sect3 id="viruses">
<title>Viruses</title>

<para>
 And now something <emphasis>not</emphasis> to worry about. Viruses seem to be
 primarily a Microsoft problem. For various reasons, viruses
 are not a significant threat to Linux users. This is not to say that it will
 always be this way, but the current virus explosion that plagues Microsoft
 systems, can not spread to Linux (or Unix) based systems. In fact, the
 various methods and practices that enable this phenomena, are not exploitable
 on Linux. So Anti-Virus software is not recommended as part of our arsenal.
 At least for the time being with Linux only networks.

<title>Editing Text Files</title>

<para>
By Bill Staehle
</para>

<para>
All the world is a file.
</para>

<para>
There are a great many types of files, but I'm going to stretch it here,
and class them into two really broad families:
</para>

<Para>
 <Literal>
  <MSGText> 
   <LiteralLayout>


 Text files are just that.
 Binary files are not.

    </LiteralLayout>
  </MSGText>
 </Literal>
</Para>

<para>
Binary files are meant to be read by machines, text files can be easily
edited, and are generally read by people. But text files can be (and
frequently are) read by machines. Examples of this would be configuration
files, and scripts.
</para>

<para>
There are a number of different text editors available in *nix.  A few
are found on every system. That would be '/bin/ed' and '/bin/vi'. 'vi' is
almost always a clone such as 'vim' due to license problems. The problem with
'vi' and 'ed' is that they are terribly user unfriendly. Another common editor
that is not always installed by default is 'emacs'. It has a lot more features
and capability, and is not easy to learn either.
</para>

<para>
 As to 'user friendly' editors, 'mcedit' and 'pico' are good choices to start
 with. These are often much easier for those new to *nix. 
</para>

<para>
 The first things to learn are how to exit an editing session, how to save
 changes to the file, and then how to avoid breaking long lines that should
 not be broken (wrapped). 
</para>

<para>
The 'vi' editor
</para>

<para>
'vi' is one of the most common text editors in the Unix world, and it's
nearly always found on any *nix system. Actually, due to license problems,
the '/bin/vi' on a Linux system is always a 'clone', such as 'elvis',
'nvi', or 'vim' (there are others). These clones can act exactly like
the original 'vi', but usually have additional features that make it
slightly less impossible to use.
</para>

<para>
So, if it's so terrible, why learn about it?  Two reasons. First, as
noted, it's almost guaranteed to be installed, and other (more user
friendly) editors may not be installed by default.  Second, many of the
'commands' work in other applications (such as the pager 'less' which is
also used to view man pages). In 'less', accidentally pressing the 'v' key
starts 'vi' in most installations.
</para>

<para>
'vi' has two modes.  The first is 'command mode', and keystrokes are
interpreted as commands. The other mode is 'insert' mode, where nearly all
keystrokes are interpreted as text to be inserted.
</para>

<para>
==> Emergency exit from 'vi'
1. press the &lt;esc&gt; key up to three times, until the computer beeps, or the
screen flashes.
2. press the keys :q! &lt;Enter&gt;
</para>

<para>
 That is: colon, the letter Q, and then the exclamation point, followed by
 the Enter key.

</para>

<para>
'vi' commands  are as follows. All of these are in 'command' mode:

The 'ed' editor.
</para>

<para>
The 'ed' editor is a line editor. Other than the fact that it is virtually
guaranteed to be on any *nix computer, it has no socially redeeming
features, although some applications may need it. A _lot_ of things have
been offered to replace this 'thing' from 1975.

<para>
1. type a period on a line by itself, and press &lt;Enter&gt;   This gets you to
the command mode or prints a line of text if you were in command mode.
2.  type  q  and press &lt;Enter&gt;.  If there were no changes to the file,
this action quits ed. If you then see a '?' this means that the file had
changed, and 'ed' is asking if you want to save the changes. Press q and
&lt;Enter&gt; a second time to confirm that you want out.
</para>

<para>
The 'pico' editor.
</para>

<para>
'pico' is a part of the Pine mail/news package from the University of
Washington (state, USA). It is a very friendly editor, with one minor
failing. It silently inserts a line feed character and wraps the line when
it exceeds (generally) 74 characters.  While this is fine while creating
mail, news articles, and text notes, it is often fatal when editing system
files. The solution to this problem is simple. Call the program with the
-w  option, like this:
</para>

<para>
pico -w file_2_edit
</para>

<para>
Pico is so user friendly, no further instructions are needed. It _should_
be obvious (look at the bottom of the screen for commands). There is an
extensive help function.  Pico is available with nearly all distributions,
although it _may_ not be installed by default.
</para>

<para>
==> Emergency exit from 'pico'
</para>

<para>
Press and hold the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key, and press the letter x. If no changes
had been made to the file, this will quit pico. If changes had been made,
it will ask if you want to save the changes. Pressing n will then exit.
</para>

<para>
The 'mcedit' editor.
</para>

<para>
'mcedit' is part of the Midnight Commander shell program, a full featured
visual shell for Unix-like systems. It can be accessed directly from the
command line ( mcedit file_2_edit ) or as part of 'mc' (use the arrow keys
to highlight the file to be edited, then press the F4 key).
</para>

<para>
mcedit is probably the most intuitive editor available, and comes with
extensive help. "commands" are accessed through the F* keys. Midnight
Commander is available with nearly all distributions, although it _may_ not
be installed by default.
</para>

<para>
==> Emergency exit from 'mcedit'
</para>

<para>
Press the F10 key. If no changes have been made to the file, this will
quit mcedit. If changes had been made, it will ask if you want to Cancel
this action. Pressing n   will then exit.

<para>
 Let's look at a few quick examples of what <command>nmap</command> scans 
 look like. The intent here is to show how to use <command>nmap</command>
 to verify our firewalling, and system integrity. <command>nmap</command> 
 has other uses that we don't need to get into. Do NOT use 
 <command>nmap</command> on systems other than your own, unless you have 
 permission from the owner, and you know it is not a violation of anyone's
 Terms of Service. This kind of thing <emphasis>will</emphasis> be taken as
 hostile by most people.

</para>

<para>
 As mentioned previously, <command>nmap</command> is a sophisticated 
 port scanning tool. It tries to see if a host is <quote>there</quote>, 
 and what ports might be open. Barring that, what states those ports 
 might be in. <command>nmap</command> has a complex command line and 
 can do many types of <quote>scans</quote>. See the man page for all 
 the nitty gritty.

</para>

<para>
 A couple of words of warning first. If using
 <application>portsentry</application>, turn it off. It will drop the route
 to wherever the scan is coming from. You might want to turn off any logging
 also, or at least be aware that you might get copious logs if doing multiple
 scans.

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 If you've read most of this document, you should be familiar with 
 these services by now. These are some of the same ports we've seen in other
 examples. Some things to note on this scan: it only did 1500+
 <quote>interesting</quote>  ports -- not all ports. This can be configured
 differently if more is desirable (see man page). It only did TCP ports too.
 Again, configurable. It only picks up <quote>listening</quote> services,
 unlike <command>netstat</command> that shows all open ports -- listening or
 otherwise. Note the last <quote>open</quote> port here is 3000 is identified
 as <quote>PPP</quote>. Wrong! That is just an educated guess by nmap based on
 what is contained in <filename>/etc/services</filename> for this port number.
 Actually in this case it is <application>ntop</application> (a network
 traffic monitor). Take the service names with a grain of salt. There is no
 way for <command>nmap</command> to really know what is on that port. Matching
 port numbers with service names can at times be risky. Many do have standard
 ports, but there is nothing to say they have to use the commonly associated
 port numbers.  

</para>

<para>
 Notice that in all our <command>netstat</command> examples, we had two classes
 of open ports: listening servers, and then established connections that we
 initiated to other remote hosts (e.g. a web server somewhere).
 <command>nmap</command> only sees the first group -- the listening servers! 
 The other ports connecting us to remote servers are not visible, and thus 
 not vulnerable. These ports are <quote>private</quote> to that single 
 connection, and will be closed when the connection is terminated.
</para>

<para>
 So we have open and closed ports here. Simple enough, and gives a pretty good
 idea what is running on bigcat -- but not necessarily what we look like to
 the outside world since this was done from localhost, and wouldn't reflect 
 any firewalling or other access control mechanisms.

</para>

<para>
 Let's do a little more intensive scan. Let's check all ports -- TCP and UDP.

</para>

<para>
 This is more than just <quote>interesting</quote> ports -- it is everything. 
 We picked up a couple of new ones in the process too. We've seen these before 
 with <command>netstat</command>, so we know what they are. That is the 
 <command>Junkbuster</command> web proxy on port 8000/tcp and
 <command>named</command> on 32768/udp. This scan takes much, much longer, but it 
 is the only way to see all ports.

</para>

<para>
 So now we have a pretty good idea of what is open on bigcat. Since 
 we are scanning localhost from localhost, everything should be visible. 
 We still don't know how the outside world sees us though. Now I'll
 <command>ssh</command> to another host on the same LAN, and try again.

 All 1523 scanned ports on bigcat (192.168.1.1) are: filtered
 
 Nmap run completed -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1643 seconds

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 That's it. Notice how long that took. Notice ports are now
 <quote>filtered</quote> instead of <quote>closed</quote>. How does
 <command>nmap</command> know that? Well for one, <quote>closed</quote> means
 bigcat sent a packet back saying <quote>nothing running here</quote>, i.e.
 port is closed. In this last example, the <application>iptables</application>
 rules were changed to not allow ICMP (ping), and to <quote>DROP</quote> all
 incoming packets. In other words, no response at all. A subtle difference
 since <command>nmap</command> seems to still know there was a host there,
 even though no response was given. One lesson here, is if you want to slow a
 scanner down, <quote>DROP</quote> (or <quote>DENY</quote>) the packets. This
 forces a TCP time out for the remote end on each port probe. Anyway, if your
 scans look like this, that is probably as well as can be expected, and your 
 firewall is doing its job.

</para>

<para>
 A brief note on UDP: <command>nmap</command> can not accurately determine 
 the status of these ports if they are <quote>filtered</quote>. You probably
 will get a false-positive <quote>open</quote> condition. This has to do with
 UDP being a connectionless protocol. If <command>nmap</command> gets no 
 answer (e.g. due to a <quote>DROP</quote>), it assumes the packets reached
 the target, and thus the port will be reported as <quote>open</quote>. 
 This is <quote>normal</quote> for <command>nmap</command>.

</para>

<para>
 We can play with firewall rules in a LAN set up to try to simulate how the 
 outside world sees us, and if we are smart, and know what we are doing, 
 and don't have a brain fart, we probably will have a pretty good picture. But
 it is still best to try to find a way to do it from outside if possible.
 Again, make sure you are not violating any ISP rules of conduct. Do you have
 a friend on the same ISP?

<title>Summary</title>

<para>
 A quick run down of the some highlights...

</para>

<!--
<para>
 Again we started by setting some shell variables in the top section, but a
 few more this time. Then we set the default rules (ipchains calls these
 <quote>policies</quote>) of denying all inbound and forwarded traffic, and of
 allowing all our own outbound traffic. Same as the former example. 

</para>

<para>
 But then we added some specific rules to block any <quote>private</quote> 
 IP addresses that from our external interface. We shouldn't see these on the
 Internet. These are used for LANs, and private networks. We then enabled
 <quote>masquerading</quote>. Then added a <quote>blacklist</quote> concept.
 These would addresses that we want banned totally, no matter what. We also
 added a <quote>trusted</quote> hosts rule, for our good friends who we are
 allowing access to all services. Then made possible <quote>port
 forwarding</quote>, if we wanted some services forwarded to an internal host,
 rather than be running on our firewall itself. This is considered a safer way
 in most cases. Note that <application>iptables</application> handles this
 itself, but <application>ipchains</application> requires a separate helper
 package, <application>ipmasqadm</application>.

</para>

<para>
 We then opened a few exceptions to the inbound default policy. First by
 allowing public access to our ssh server. This could have been a list of
 ports, but we just used one in this example. Anybody on the Internet could
 be able to access these - except the <quote>blacklisted</quote> hosts that
 we have a special rule for.

</para>
-->

<para>
 We added some host based access control rules: <quote>blacklisted</quote>, 
 and <quote>trusted</quote>. We then showed several types of service 
 and port based access rules. For instance, we allowed some very restrictive
 access to bigcat's <application>POP3</application> server so we could connect
 only from our workplace. We allowed a very narrow rule for the ISP's DHCP
 server. This rule only allows one port on one outside IP address to connect
 to only one of our ports and only via the UDP protocol. This is a very
 specific rule! We are being specific since there is no reason to allow any
 other traffic to these ports or from these addresses. Remember our goal is
 the minimum amount of traffic necessary for our particular situation. 

</para>

<para>
 So we made those few exceptions mentioned above, and all other services
 running on bigcat should be effectively blocked completely from outside
 connections. These are still happily running on bigcat, but are now safe and
 sound behind our packet filtering firewall. You probably have other services
 that fall in this category as well.

</para>

<para>
 We also have a small, home network in the above example. We did not take any
 steps to block that traffic. So the LAN has access to all services running on
 bigcat. And it is further <quote>masqueraded</quote>, so that it has Internet 
 access (different HOWTO), by manipulating the <quote>forward</quote> chain. 
 And the LAN is still protected by our firewall since it sits behind the
 firewall. We also didn't impose any restrictive rules on the traffic leaving
 bigcat. In some situations, this might be a good idea. 

</para>

<para>
 Of course, this is just a hypothetical example. Your individual situation is
 surely different, and would require some changes and likely some additions to
 the rules above. For instance, if your ISP does not use DHCP (most do not),
 then that rule would make no sense. <application>PPP</application> works
 differently and such rules are not needed. 
 
</para>

<para>
 Please don't interpret that running any server as we did in this example is
 necessarily a <quote>safe</quote> thing to do. We shouldn't do it this way
 unless a) we really need to and b) we are running the current, safe version,
 and c) we are able to keep abreast of security related issues that might
 effect these services. Vigilance and caution are part of our responsibilities
 here too.

<title>iptables mini-me</title>
<para>
 Just to demonstrate how succinctly <application>iptables</application> can be
 configured in a minimalist situation, the below is from the Netfilter team's
 <citetitle>Rusty's Really Quick Guide To Packet Filtering</citetitle>:
</para>

<blockquote>
 <para>
 <quote>Most people just have a single PPP connection to the Internet, and
 don't want anyone coming back into their network, or the firewall:</quote>
 </para>
</blockquote>

<para>
 <programlisting>

 ## Insert connection-tracking modules (not needed if built into kernel).
 insmod ip_conntrack
 insmod ip_conntrack_ftp

 ## Create chain which blocks new connections, except if coming from inside.
 iptables -N block
 iptables -A block -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
 iptables -A block -m state --state NEW -i ! ppp0 -j ACCEPT
 iptables -A block -j DROP

 ## Jump to that chain from INPUT and FORWARD chains.
 iptables -A INPUT -j block
 iptables -A FORWARD -j block

 </programlisting>
</para>

<para>
 This simple script will allow all outbound connections that we initiate, i.e. 
 any <application>NEW</application> connections (since the default policy of
 ACCEPT is not changed). Then any connections that are
 <quote>ESTABLISHED</quote> and <quote>RELATED</quote> to these are also
 allowed. And, any connections that are not incoming from our WAN side
 interface, <literal>ppp0</literal>, are also allowed. This would be lo or
 possibly a LAN interface like eth1. So we can do whatever we want, but no
 unwanted, incoming connection attempts are allowed from the Internet. None.

</para>

<para>
 This script also demonstrates the creation of a custom chain, defined here
 as <quote>block</quote>, which is used both for the INPUT and FORWARD 
 chains.
