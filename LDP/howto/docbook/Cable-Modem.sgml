<title>Setting up your Ethernet Card</title>

<para>
All of the setups below use ethernet cards (network cards) to connect
you somehow to the Internet. That is why first we need to check if
your ethernet card is working and most importantly can be used (read
is supported) in Linux. There is a comprehensive Ethernet HOWTO at
<ulink
url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Ethernet-HOWTO.html">http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Ethernet-HOWTO.html</ulink>
if you would like to read it otherwise try this.
</para>

<para>
Boot into Linux, During boot up a message like this should appear...
</para>

<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
eth0: 3c509 at 0x300 tag 1, 10baseT port, address  00 20 af ee 01 23, IRQ 10.
3c509.c:1.07 6/15/95 becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov
]]>
</programlisting>

<para>
If you missed it type <command>dmesg</command>.
</para>

<para>
If you see a message like that you are set and you can go to the next
section. If you can't see a message like this there are two possible
explanations, your ethernet card is PNP (plug-n-play) and you need to
use tools such as isapnptools to get it recognized (I am not quite
sure on this because I don't have a single PNP card so correct me if I
am wrong). The other explanation is that you need to set up your card.
</para>

<para>
Most cards today come with DOS programs that are used to setup your
card. For example to get my 3COM 3c509 to work all I needed to do is
boot into DOS and use a utility to configure my card. There is usually
a Auto Configure option. If that does not solve your problem try
changing the IRQ for the card using the same utility. I find that
usually IRQs 10,11 and 12 work well. If none of this solves your
problem please read the Ethernet HOWTO referenced above or post to a
newsgroup such as comp.os.linux.setup or comp.os.linux.networking.

<para>
MediaOne Express is a Internet cable service provided by MediaOne. The
hardware setup consists of a cable modem produced by LanCity or
General Instruments which plugs into an ethernet card using a 10BaseT
(UTP-45) cable. Assignment of IP addresses and other networking
information is done using DHCP which stands for Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol. The only thing you need to do is read the
DHCP mini-HOWTO and configure your system appropriately. There is no
other necessary configuration. DHCP mini-HOWTO can be found at

<sect2 id="home"> 
<title id="home.title">@Home</title>

<para>
@Home uses a similar setup to <link linkend=mediaone
endterm="mediaone.title"></link>.
However, there are a few fundamental differences, outlined by
contributors. Since @Home spans different geographic locations you might
get assigned different kind of equipment and have slightly different kind
of setups. 
</para>   

<para>
Before you try anything, go to control panel, network, and properties
for your network card. Write down all of the information. You will
need it later.
</para>

<para>   
TCI, the company that runs @Home issues a Etherlink III 3c509b NIC for
all of their customers. What TCI does not tell you is that when they
install your ethernet card, it is in PnP mode. Now in Slakware, if you
uncomment the proper line for this card, everything will appear to be
working fine. There will be no system problems, but the 'PC' light on
your CyberSURFR modem will never turn on. If you are using Slakware,
and are having this problem, reboot in DOS and skip the next
paragraph.
</para>

<para>  
In RedHat 5, your system will have some trouble autodetecting the card.
If you try to pass the paramaters manually, the system will hang. This
should be obvious that your card is not setup properly. Before wasting
anymore time, reboot in DOS (This is a must because as of 12/25/97,
there is no utility written for Linux to turn off PnP and turn on
ISA.)
</para>

<para>   
TCI does not give out a utility disk for your ethernet card, so you
must download the utility from one of 3Com's sites. Here is a link to
3COM's page for driver download.
</para>

<para>   
<ulink
url="http://support.3com.com/infodeli/tools/nic/index.htm">http://support.3com.com/infodeli/tools/nic/index.htm</ulink>
</para>

<para>
Once you have downloaded your driver files you will need to run them
and disable the PNP mode of your network card.
</para>

<para>   
What you've now done will make your ethernet card 'broken' in Windows
95. You'll need to go to Control Panel, Network, and remove the
network card and the adapter. Reboot your computer, and again go back
to control panel. Go to add/remove new hardware, and have it
autodetect. It will automatically setup the correct i/o address for
you. You will most likely need to reboot again. Now you should be in
Windows 95, with the 'PC' light on your cable modem on. You will also
notice that none of your internet applications seem to work, you can't
ping, and you can't resolve DNS. You now must go back to control
panels, network, and click on properties for your network card (not
the adapter). Re-enter all the data you wrote down, and reboot.
</para>

<para>   
With a little luck, your ethernet card should be working in Windows
95, and ready to rock in Linux.

require kernel recompilation.

<title>Notes from Connecticut, USA</title>
<para>
Information provided by <email>dan@sidhe.org</email>.
</para>
<para>
The @Home folks are using Motorola cable modems (I know, I got one) in
addition to any other brand folks have reported. If it's getting hooked
into a hub it needs to either get plugged in with a twisted-pair
cross-over cable or go into the 'to other hubs' port if your hub has one.
(Which is standard, I expect, for these things, but useful to keep in mid
if, like me, you're hooking the thing on to an existing local network) I
have a plain Compaq 10/100 ethernet card (I think it's the NC3131, but I'm
not 100% sure) in my linux box and it worked without a hitch.
</para>
<para>
Also, they are handing out fixed IP addresses, at least in Connecticut,
and you can get up to three. (They charge $4.95/mo for each extra IP
address they allocate) They make no requirements on the OSes on these
extra machines--I've a Vax running VMS and they didn't bat an eye when I
signed it up. They did want the initial machine to be something they
recognized (I booted over to Win98 for the duration) but they would've
handled a linux-only install if really, *really* pressed

<title>Notes from Dallas, TX or anyone using Motorola CyberSurfr</title>
<para>
If you have a Motorola CyberSurfr cable modem you will need 
to press the reset key on the back of the modem if you switch 
network cards. The ethernet card hardware address is read by the modem 
and once it is setup if the card is switched it must be reset.Just press
the reset key for 10+ seconds and it will reread.

Update from James Stormes <email>jstormes@gtfcu.com</email>
</para>

<para>
@Home has been upgrading the cable modem system in Bedford Texas (the area
around Dallas Texas).  I have found that with the new system your NIC's MAC
address must match what the cable system has.  That is the Linux system you
plug into the cable modem must use the same MAC that is programmed into the
board you got from @Home.  I use two diffrent computers on the cable modem
(Linux and Windows) so this was a problem.
</para>

<para>
For some NIC drivers you can specify the MAC. For example in
n REDHAT 6.1 in the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 you can add
the line MACADDR="0F4F3E54A659".  Where eth0 is the NIC card attached to the
cable modem and the 0F4F3E54A659 is the MAC that the cable modem system is
expecting.

<title>Notes from Madison, WI and Lakeridge, VA</title>
<para>
I have a cable modem from Bresnan in madison wi, they use the @home network for
internet trafic and supply there users with the RCA cable modems.
In the howto it states that the -h flag should be used for the host name with
dhcpcd.  That didn't work for me.  They provided me with a machine name of
cb46597-a.mdsn1.wi.home.com, the cd46597-a obviously being my hosts name....
anyway.. the flag I had to use to get dhcpcd working was the -I flag for
ClientID. ClientID is actually the MAC (Ethernet) address of your NIC e.g. 
00:00:21:61:7C:F0.

<title>Notes from Baton Rouge, LA by Van Goodwin <email>positron@redstroke.com</email></title>
<para>
Here, @Home doesn't seem to have a standard ethernet card.
They gave me a "SMC EtherEZ" ISA card, but I've seen them
install totally different cards in other systems.  The installer told me
they gave static IP addresses to people who use Windows NT and
dynamic to everyone else.  Don't ask me why.

<title>Notes from Richmond, VA and its surroundings by Robert Marshall <email>no_robmars_spam@yahoo.com</email>
</title>
<para>
In Chesterfield County, Virginia (a suburb of Richmond), @Home offers cable
modem service through the local cable provider, Comcast. The service runs very
well with Linux. As with many @Home locations, IP addresses are assigned via
dhcp, and they require that all dhcp request packets contain the user's
@Home-assigned hostname. The dhcpcd package works well for this, using the -h
parameter. Personal best download - 16Mbytes in 54 seconds.
</para>

<para>
In Henrico County, Hanover County, and the city of Richmond, Virginia, MediaOne
is offerring their Road Runner service. IP addresses are assigned using dhcp,
but are exclusively reserved by MAC address. This requires that the user call
MediaOne support if the MAC address attached to the cable modem ever changes.
The MediaOne people refused to re-register my friend's new MAC address when he
told them that he had purchased a personal firewall from NetGear. They even
tried to insist that he purchase commercial service, even though he was only
going to have one PC connected to the service. Thus, I strongly agree with your
wording in the HOWTO that MediaOne customers carefully avoid mentioning the
words "router", "firewall", or "Linux".

<title>Notes from Mobile, Alabama R. Jason Valentine <email>miracle@procyon.com</email>:

<para>
In Mobile, Comcast cable provides cable modem service through the @home
network.  An RCA cable modem (model DCM205) is issued along with a SMC
EZ-Card (10/100) if you don't already have a cable modem.

<para>
Static IPs are not given, but rather assigned through DHCP.  You need to

<title>RoadRunner</title>
<para>
RoadRunner is an Internet cable service provided by Excalibur Group
(Time Warner). The hardware setup consists of a cable modem produced
by Motorola and Toshiba which plugs into an ethernet card using a
10BaseT (UTP-45) cable. From what I can gather RR uses DHCP for IP
assignment. In order to set up Linux to use DHCP you need to read the
DHCP mini-HOWTO <ulink

One more thing that might be worth mentioning:  you will need a Windows NT,
95, or 98 or Macintosh PC for the RoadRunner installers to configure the
modem.  It's not technically necessary, but they will insist, and will not
install on a Linux system.  It's also best not to mention the IPFW system
while they're around.
</para>

<para>
Additional notes by Phil Baird <email>pjb@rocsoft.com</email> from Rochester, NY:
</para>

<para>
About getting hooked up initially.  It is true the RR techs don't want
to talk about Linux.  However, they now offer us a "self-install" that is
half the price ($50).  Basically, they come out, run the cable, and make
sure the signal gets to the modem.  You must supply your own nic card and
do the rest of the setup on your own.

<para>
They now only give out dynamic IP's. The techs says its pretty much fixed

their end can just be 'pushed out' so to speak.

Also Make sure any cablemodem uses ensure they don't use a DHCP server on their

<para>
This information is provided by Bob Kimble:
</para>

<para>
Jones Internet Cable supplies a Hybrid cable modem that connects to your
machine / network via 10BaseT ethernet. They provide you with a static IP
address for your machine, and another static IP address for the modem. The
modem acts as a gateway to their network. Your IP address and the modem IP
address are on the same network and have the same network mask (in my case
255.255.255.0 -- 24 bits). They also provide two DNS IP addresses which
you enter into your configuration. I just entered the numbers when I
installed Red Hat Linux 5 and it worked like a champ from the beginning.
Since then I have configured my Linux machine to enable IP masquerading
and domain name services, and it now acts as a router for my entire
private network. My other machines are connected via a private network
using the addresses 192.168.0.x. They are running Windows 95, Windows NT
(Intel and Alpha) and OS/2. My Linux machine has two IP addresses -- the
one from the cable company and one from
the 192.168.0.x private network. Everything works like a champ. All six
machines can browse the web simultaneously. My kids are even able to
connect to their favorite game site, "The Realm" from Sierra.

<title>GTE Worldwind</title>
<para>
This information is provided by Blake R. Swopes (bhodi@bigfoot.com):
</para>

<para>
GTE WorldWind service is available in only a few areas (parts of California
and Florida), its home page is located at 
<ulink url="http://www.gtecablemodem.com/">http://www.gtecablemodem.com/</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
GTE will send a technician out to hook up the cable modem to the wall, but
does not do any configuration of your computer. The cable you hook up to
your computer is the ethernet standard 10baseT (and you'll probably need to
buy your own, since the one they left with me was only about two feet long).
</para>

<para>
The technician should leave you some information about configuring your
system (IP address, gateway address, netmask, DNS addresses) and the number
for GTE's support line (1-800-GTE-VIDEO, since WorldWind is attached to
GTE's Americast cable service). If you have read the Ethernet-HOWTO and the
DHCP mini-HOWTO, you should have no trouble configuring your system to work
with WorldWind.
</para>

<para>
GTE provides one e-mail address, which they assign to you, but you can
create aliases to that account and web mail accounts through gte.net.
</para>

<para>
According to GTE, they block inbound traffic on several ports for security
purposes and to keep people from running servers that will eat into other
users' bandwidth (e.g., telnet, DNS, News, and Netbios (Good news for
Windows users)). In actual practice, I have found that I was able to telnet
into my system from remote hosts.
</para>

<para>
GTE does not provide technical support for Linux users, so you will pretty
much be on your own. My experience was that as soon as I mentioned Linux,
they tried to get me off the phone, but that might have been the particular
tech I was speaking to at the time.
</para>

<para>
GTE also advised me that they do not support users who have IBM Aptivas,
however I was able to briefly connect an IBM Aptia 2176-C77 with a SOHOWare
PCI 10/100 Ethernet Card to the service with no trouble at all.

Additional information from Philip Gwyn
<email>gwynp@artware.qc.ca</email>:
</para>

<para>
They use Motorola CyberSURFR (sic) modems.  This will give you an
ethernet NIC when you sign up.  They gave me a TMC NE2000 PCI clone,
which Linux recognises as a "RealTek RTL-8029".  It couldn't configure
it propperly however, until I downloaded the manufacturer's driver disk
and changed the media type to "auto-config".  
</para>

<para>
While they can't guarantee to get it working with Linux, they will do a
bit of hand holding so it works.  Many of the tech-support have
Linux-clues, as it were, even asking questions like "what kernel are you
running?"  "do you have the latest version of dhcpcd?".  When their DHCP
server broke, they even suggested I delete the cache files in
/etc/dhcpcd to start over from zero, as it were.  This worked.

<para>
    The modem they provide is now Samsung InfoRanger (SCM-100R). The ISA
card they provide is an SMC NE2000 compatible (FCC ID: HED1661EN2). It
is necessary to configure the card from DOS to NE2000 mode before
attempting to get it to work under Linux. (Generally, this card is
horrible. I replaced with a 3Com card as soon as possible).
</para>

<para>
The technical support in Videotron is absolutely HORRIBLE. (Not to
mention Linux support). So, whoever signs up with them, should expect to
work alone. However, aside from the NIC problems, the setup was a
breeze. They use DHCP, so all the standard procedures apply.

Tebecai is yet another provider which uses a LANcity cable modem

(see the <ulink url="http://www.oswg.org/oswg-nightly/DHCP.html">

modem under Linux can be found at <ulink

remember that your IP-address is not visible from the Internet (it is on

This information is provided by Johan List

<para>
Basically the way to go is the same as with Tebecai.  A2000 provides
cable internet access by means of a LANCity cable modem, connected to an
10BaseT ethernet card. This also works well for the "Vortex/Boomerang"
cards by 3COM (I've got a 3COM Boomerang Fast Etherlink XL 10/100Mb TX
Ethernet Adapter), providing you compile the Vortex/Boomerang drivers.
(See the Linux Ethernet-HOWTO)

<para>
Contrary to Tebecai, your IP-number *is* visible from the Internet, so

I thought I'd just drop you a line to inform you that your

cable-modem service, and that you might want to add `Shaw@Home'
to your Cable-Modem mini-HOWTO as another entry. I don't have specific
information on the `Shaw@Home' service yet, but from conversations I've
had with Shaw technical support it seems that `Shaw@Home' is a
partnership with <link linkend=home endterm="home.title"></link> and
involves the same features and setup procedure as that already described
for <link linkend=home endterm="home.title"></link> in the Cable-Modem
mini-HOWTO document.  
</para>

<para>
In both services Shaw Cable techs will come over and bring you two
pieces of hardware -- a Motorola CyberSURFR cable-modem and either a
3Com EtherLink III 16-Bit ISA 3C509B-TPO NIC or an EtherLink XL PCI
3C900-TPO NIC.  You have your choice of either an ISA or a PCI card
depending on your needs, and these models only have the RJ-45 (UTP)
connectors.  The ISA cards come with PnP-mode enabled by default, so it
may be necessary to boot into DOS, disable PnP operation, and configure
the card to some base I/O address and IRQ setting which are available.
Once this is done Linux should have no problems detecting the NIC at
boot-time.  I'm not sure about what needs to be done in the case of a
PCI card since I don't currently have a PC which supports either PCI or
PnP.
</para>

<para>
Note from another user:
</para>

<para>
Shaw now also issues SMC PCI ethernet cards.  They give these out
without boxes or manuals.  I found out that these are the SMC EtherPower
PCI RJ45 card (model 8432T).  They use the DEC 21041 chip so the tulip
ethernet driver is needed for it.

<para>
I have a Cable Modem through a company called Cogeco Cable located in
various parts of Canada. They are part of the "Wave" system which includes
Rogers Cable and Shaw Cable. The technical setup is different for each
provider though. They supplied me with a D-Link ethernet card (the version
of that has changed since then but I believe are still using D-Link) and a
Zenith modem. The Ip setup is easy since they use DHCP so all I did was
<ulink url="http://www.oswg.org/oswg-nightly/DHCP.html">install the
DHCP daemon</ulink> and that was that. If you like you can list my
e-mail address <email>togrady@cgocable.net</email> for anyone with questions.
</para>

<para>
 I contacted you awhile ago with information regarding setting up a
cable modem under Cogeco (the mail came from togrady@cgocable.net). Well I
have some updates to give you. Cogeco has now joined the @HOME network
although I haven't seen anything good come out of yet. The modems have
changed as well, instead of the old Zenith modems we now are using a
Samsung InfoRanger SCM-100R modem. The modem changed has not affected the
ease of setting up Linux with the cable modem. All that is still required
is a functioning network card and 
<ulink url="http://www.oswg.org/oswg-nightly/DHCP.html">working DHCP
client </ulink> and you will be able
to get the network functioning quickly. Many people send questions to me
regarding various cable modem/dhcp/networking issues and as a result I
have started to put together some help pages. The are  located at
<ulink url="http://incisive.dhs.org/">http://incisive.dhs.org</ulink>.
</para>


<para>
Additional info has been provided Craig Kossowski:
</para>

<para>
Cogeco seems to be slowly getting themselves sorted out wrt cable modems
and is now part of the set of Canadian cable companies that have
cooperated on the @Home network.  A network card is provided as part of
their large (but currently waived) hookup fee; the D-Link 528CT for PCI
capable systems, and, I believe, D-Link 220T for ISA systems (and possibly
PCI capable computers that will accept the ISA card, they tried it in my
roommate's system first, only when that didn't work did they put in the
PCI 528CT).  I'd recommend asking for the PCI if you have the choice, as I
know that setup can work with Linux from my experience.
</para>

<para>
Both of these are NE2000 boards to the best of my knowledge.  I got the
PCI D-Link 528CT which uses the RealTek 8029 chipset, and Linux can deal
with easily.  I just recompiled the kernel, and after a little hiccup due
to RedHat 5.2's lilo default not looking for the kernel at /vmlinuz, I was
up and running.  DHCP (with a 24 hour lease lifetime) is used for IP
resolution and everything worked automaticaly (I had selected a DHCP config
when I installed Linux, others may need to do slightly more configuration,
but it doesn't require anything non-standard). The 528 is supposedly
plug & play, but I had no problems using it in my Linux box (2.0.34).  Note
that you need to compile in (either built in or module, I used built in)
the PCI NE2k code, and unlike what is implied in the Ethernet HOWTO, you
don't need to also include the ISA NE2000 code to use this chipset.  I
don't have experience with the ISA D-Link 220T, but I would assume it's
just as easy to set up, it's listed as a supported card in the Ethernet
HOWTO.
</para>

<para>
The Cable modem I got was a great heavy thing that looks like a heatsink
for a small nuclear reactor.  Nearly a square foot in desk space, made by
LANcity, and I believe rated for 10Mbps shared bandwidth on the cable
subset side of things, it has a reasonably good set of LEDs to show you
what it's doing once you figure out what each one is. While throughput
will obviously vary, I see transfer rates around 10kB/s (80kbit/s) and up
during the day, to 50-60kB/s at night, when presumably thinks are quieter
on the backbone. Subjectively, it's very fast, and beats even fast modems
hands down.  I haven't had it long enough to determine uptime yet, so I
can't comment there.
</para>

<para>
At the time of this writing (Jan 99), Cogeco's service runs $150 for
installation, including the card, and $39.99 a month for the service.
They're currently waiving the modem rental fee "until they are available
for purchase" but the information there is mixed from 15.04/month as of
early 1999 (from the web page) to "not for some time" from their phone
staff. Included with this is up to five email addresses, and 5MB of Web
space. They also say there is a 1GB/month limit, though I'm told (by their
tech support people) that this isn't strictly enforced, and is more to
discourage ftp sites with high traffic bogging down the subnets, and to
provide them with an avenue to prevent such.  Although their literature
doesn't say so, additional computers are an extra 10.70 a month, though
unsupported, and you have to provide the hub, wiring and additional
ethercards if you do this, they're basicly charging the extra for the
lease of an additional IP as far as I can tell from their information.

I just read your  Cable Modem HOWTO. I live in France, and I use Cable
Wanadoo, the cable service of France Telecom, which is the main telecom
operator in France. It is available in a few cities in France at the
moment, like Angers and Metz. This service provides a dynamic IP address
via DHCP. It uses a COM 21 modem plugged in a 10BaseT Ethernet card.
The IP setup is easy just read the

The current Casema cable modems operate via the serial port, acting like
normal modems, answering AT commands like phone modems. The setup is
really very easy, because all the chat script needs to do is dial ATDT4.
(this is in ppp-on-dialer). Hence it uses PPP, which is unusual for
most cable modems.

This information is provided by Jens B. Jorgensen

</para>

<para>
21st Century uses a "Regular" cable modem, that is up-stream and
down-stream are both over the cable connection. The equipment is made by
Zenith. The installer will bring along a NIC with them, (mine was an OEM
Intel EtherExpress Pro 10/100) which is connected via a 10-base-T cable
(crossover?) directly to the cable modem. All 21st Century customers are
assigned a static IP address. Just make sure your kernel is configured
to support this card or insmod the module for it a configure the IP.
You'll also be provided with a gateway address which you'll need to set
the default route to. Be mindful of the netmask (255.255.0.0 for me) on
the ether interface. Also note that the cable modem seems to 'learn' the
ethernet address of the adapter you're provided with and will only work
wit that adapter. I don't know if reseting the cable modem would cause
it to relearn the address or not. I didn't feel the need to try the
cable modem with another adapter.
</para>

<para>
Additional notes by Mark Howard <email>mark@xanderbelly.com</email>
</para>

<para>
Please note that this service has been changed; they now only use Nortel
cable modems and everyone is assigned a dynamic IP address now.  Also, my
Nortel cable modem does not seem to care which machine or MAC address is
connected to it; I have set up multiple machines on it and they all
worked fine.  In fact, if you hang a hub directly off the cable modem,
you can get multiple valid IP adresses assigned through DHCP!   I
wouldn't recommend this, however, as a long term solution.  I have a RH
box set up as a firewall doing NAT for me on the one address, and it
works just great.  This service is particularly good - I consistently get
95-100KBps, or just about a 1Mbps rate.  I also live in a coach house
rental here in Chicago, and although they wanted to run new cable in the
apartment, I told them to use the old cable because it was not my place. 
They said they could not guarantee that the service would work, but of
course it does work just fine!  So don't let them talk you into running
new cable if you can avoid it.
</para>

<para>
Also, if you want to set up your own web server from home, I used a great
service called <ulink url="http://www.easydns.com/">EasyDNS.com</ulink>
where you pay them $25 per year per domain and you can control your 
DNS settings (even SOA, TTL, etc...) 24/7/265 through a web based 
(PHP no less) interface.  So if I ever need to reboot
my Linux box (which I never do really) I can go in and update the IP
address that my web server www.xanderbelly.com and mail server

The terms and conditions of 21st Century cable modem contains the
following statement:
</para>

<para>
Distributing unsolicited information in any manner is prohibited on 21st

Also, technically, each additional dynamic IP address beyond the first
one carries a $4.95 monthly charge.

<para>
It's a Portuguese ISP and it's available through TV Cabo. 
The hardware consists of a RealTek ethernet card (just use the rtl8139.o module)
and a 3Com U.S. Robotics CMX cable modem. The only thing required to get one's
cable access up and running is configure the ethernet card and install

<para>
The setup isn't so much different than other Cable providers. They offer a
SMC (I think) network card but you can use yours if you want. They then
install a cable modem made by com21 (http://www.com21.com). IP setup is
easy since it uses DHCP so I don't think you should have any problems
under a modern linux distribution.
</para>

<para>
Last thing worth to be said is that Supercable doesn't provide support
for Linux but you can always ask your questions in news.supercable.es in
the Linux area. Their web page is located at <ulink

<title>NTL, United Kingdom</title>

<para>
This information is provided by cogNiTioN <email>cog-cablemodem@cognite.net</email>:
</para>

<para>
This assumes that you've spoken to NTL, you have the cable modem, the
cable line installed and your network card installed and recognised. You
should also have you MAC address registered with NTL.
(NTL contact: <ulink url="http://www.ntl.com/cablemodems/">http://www.ntl.com/cablemodems/</ulink>)
</para>

<para>
Now all you have to do is connect your cable modem to your network card
and run the DHCP client. I've found that you have to specify the username
you supplied during the registration process, on the command line: e.g.
root # dhcpcd -h cognition
(substitute cognition for your user name.). For any other problems with
DHCP please check out the
<ulink url="http://www.oswg.org/oswg-nightly/DHCP.html">DHCP mini-HOWTO</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
I've also found that occasionally the 3COM CMX modem used needs to be
rebooted (power off, press the reset button on the back, power on) if left
connected 24/7.
</para>

<para>
Nameservers used by NTL are: 194.168.4.100 and 194.168.8.100, so those
should be added to your /etc/resolv.conf.
</para>

<para>
I've found NTL's tech support to be close to useless, most the time and
they don't officially support Linux, so you're probably better off
contacting your local LUG (<ulink url="http://www.lug.org.uk/">http://www.lug.org.uk/</ulink> ),

<para>
This information is provided by Rishi Gangoly <email>rishi@w-o-i.com</email>:
</para>

<para>
The tech support guys at Hathway were not Linux Savvy at all, but I must say
were quite helpful. They even referred me to another customer who got Linux to
work with it. However, that person was only able to get it to work on Linux as a
stand-alone workstation and not as a gateway (as a router) for his entire
network.
</para>

<para>
Since I was not even able to get it to work as a stand-alone workstation I knew
I had a long way to go. The Windows 98 Workstation configuration was a Celeron
Workstation and it had a
10/100 D-Link Lan Card   Chipset RTL 8139 . The IP address was manually entered,
so I knew that there was no DHCP Client required etc.
</para>

<para>
Even the DNS and Gateway address was manually entered.
</para>

<para>
I was able to do a ping without any problem in Windows to any site and things
were just happening. However, I had no luck with it in Linux. I installed Linux
on the same machine (Dual Boot) to make sure there was any Hardware
compatibility problems.
</para>

<para>
I even got the workstation to hook up on the LAN successfully in Linux. So I
knew that the Lan Card was working.
</para>

<para>
I noticed that when I connected the Cable Modem to the LAN card I was not able
to see any of the Link LED light up on the LAN Card. So I figured that could be
part of the problem. I booted the PC in DOS and ran the DIAG DOS based utility
to check the configuration of the Card. I just decided to take a chance and
re-configured the LAN Card. I configured it to operate in 10 MBPS Half Duplex
Mode instead of Auto Sense.
</para>

<para>
.......... Guess what..... The problem got solved   ;-)
</para>

<para>
Even the lights (LED Link indicators) started to work, so all was good. ;-)
At the end of everything it all worked out. I plugged that lan card into the
linux server (since I knew it worked) and got it to work as a router / gateway
too. I still wonder why the other customer was not able to get the Linux Box to work
as a gateway for the rest of his network. That was no big deal at all. It just
worked. The Cable Modem that was used (provided by Hathway) was a SurfBoard 3100

First of all, let me tell you that here we have the MMD Cable Modem
from General Instrument. We use SurfBoard 1000 ISA board for download
and a regular telephone modem for upload. I would prefer to use an
external board like the SurfBoard 1200 which is available only to
corporate users, i.e., willing to pay US$ 200,00 instead of the regular
US$ 30,00 so I found out this driver for the internal ISA board.
For home users, Linkexpress (my ISP) just installs and supports
the internal ISA board - Surfboard 1000. If you want to use it, you
have to install Windows 95/98 on your computer and let the guy
from Linkexpress install the equipment. After that, make your
Linux installation as you like.

I recently accuired an expressnet cable modem for the maryland area.
it is a  com21 one way modem and I had a hell a time making it work so id like
to share my knowledge in your faq maybe? well heres what I learned
inorder for the PPP connection to authenticate the user must be running PAP
which consists of editing the <filename>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</filename>
file accordingly:
</para>

<programlisting>
#/etc/ppp/pap-secrets
#this is the PAP secrets file for PPP
#the quotes are required on both
"username"      *       "password"
</programlisting>

<para>
after that they must create a <filename>PPP-on</filename> script what ever name
it must execute this command:
</para>

<programlisting>
exec /usr/sbin/pppd debug persist /dev/ttyS1 38400 0.0.0.0:0.0.0.0 connect "chat -v TIMEOUT 3 ABORT 'BUSY' ABORT 'NOANSWER' '' ATH TIMEOUT 30 'OK' ATDTTELEPHONE CONNECT ''"
</programlisting>

<para>
this must be done with no carrage returns either    
</para>

<para>
next step is to modify the <filename>/etc/ppp/ip-up.local</filename>
file if it does not exist it should be created it should read the
following:
</para>

<programlisting>
#!/bin/bash
#/etc/ppp/ip-up.local
#this will set up the route to the ppp device as default everytime the modem
#authenticates dont include it if you do not want this option
route add default ppp0
</programlisting>

<para>
then the user must configure their ethernet card on box I have a 3c905.
</para>

<para>
I configured it the following way:
</para>

<programlisting>
ifconfig eth0 up
ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.1 broadcast 10.0.0.15 netmask 255.255.255.240
</programlisting>

<para>
then I added some more routes to the kernel routing table as follows:
</para>

<programlisting>
route add -host 10.0.0.1 eth0
route add -net 10.0.0.0 eth0
</programlisting>

<para>
all of these commands can be added into a script file as follows
</para>

<programlisting>
#!/bin/bash    
#This is a script file for establishing the cable modem IF device properties as
#well as the route properties
ifconfig eth0 up
ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.1 broadcast 10.0.0.15 netmask 255.255.255.240
route add -host 10.0.0.1 eth0
route add -net 10.0.0.0 eth0

<para>

</para>

<para>
I have Smyrna Connect, supported by Smyrna Cable in Atlanta, GA.  They
are currently (June, 1999) using half-duplex but are scheduled to have
full-duplex within six months.  The Cable Modem is a ComPort Com21.  
Here is the configuration stuff I needed to get my linux box running as 
my dialup.
</para>

<para>
My eth0 device is a 3com ISA card set to IP 10.0.0.1, Bcast 10.0.0.255,
Mask 255.255.255.0. 
</para>

<para> 
The machine is set to the hostname Smyrna418.smyrnacable.net where
Smyrna418 is my username.  I don't think this is that important, but I
haven't fiddled with it to see if it will still work once I change the
hostname.
</para>

<para>
My modem is an external 56K X2 US Robotics on <filename
class="directory">/dev/ttyS0</filename>.
</para>

<para>
I also have eth1 (a DEC tulip based pci card) set
up as 192.168.0.1 as the gateway for the rest of my network to
masquerade behind.  
</para>

<para>
Smyrna Connect does not give you DNS info for the cablemodem
since you are supposed to use the Windows PPP feature of using the
default DNS for the server you dial in to.  However, they do have one
that works at 209.116.152.252. 
</para>

<para>
I use a ppp connection script to dial in, but the guts of it is this:
</para>

<programlisting>
/usr/sbin/pppd modem /dev/ttyS0 persist mru 1000 asyncmap 0 \
-detach crtscts user Smyrna??? defaultroute connect '/usr/sbin/chat \
ABORT BUSY ABORT ERROR "" ATZ OK ATDT7704365664 CONNECT' \
57600 0.0.0.0:0.0.0.0 &
</programlisting>

<para>
I keep the persist in there since Smyrna Connect has a habit of dropping
the connection every once in awhile, and this way it automatically dials
back in. You will need to replace the Smyrna??? in the above command 
with your own username and put the line:
</para>

<programlisting>
Smyrna???       Smyrna???       password
</programlisting>

<para>
in the file <filename>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</filename>.

Roberto Salvatierra <email>chuby@internettico.com</email>:
</para>

<para>
Ok to set up a Hybrid cable modem conection using Costa Rica's Amnet
Provider is not all that hard ( once you get the hang of it ) is like 
the other providers that use com21 modems, but with some minor diferences.
</para>

<para>
My Hardware is: 
</para>

<programlisting>
CableModem: Com21 ComPort 1000
Modem     : Rockwell 56k
Ethernet  : Ne2k PCI clone
Machine   : i386
Os        : Debian 2.1
Kernel    : either a 2.2.x or a 2.3.x*
</programlisting>

<para>
The first thing I did was disable my whole networking system, mainly because
i had a real mess on my routing tables, hosts, and resolv.conf files 
( I was using several ISP's and an intranet ) so I opted for this 
but that was just me, I even stopped lo so I started with a clean config.
</para>

<para>
okey first of all if you have a dual system ( win/linux ) make sure the
system is working under windows, that way we can make sure everything is up
and running, after that, reboot to linux**. 
</para>

<para>
If you don't have a dual system I found something interesting that MIGHT
help you state if the cablemodem and the eth card are functional, first, type
this on your system:
</para>

<programlisting>
ifconfig eth0 up
ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.240
route add -host 10.0.0.1 eth0
</programlisting>

<para>
after that look in your system log files for pings from
10.0.0.4 ( I have no idea why but this machine keeps "pinging" my box ,I
asked amnet's help desk what was this all about, and they didn't give me an
answer I guess they do It to check the network integrity) well anyhow, if you
get this pings means that amnet connection is working okey.
</para>

<para>
well after we have stated that the cable modem is up and running the rest is
quite easy.
</para>

<para>
if you did the above step now lets bring eth0 down ( <command>ifconfig
eth0 down</command> )
</para>

<para>
first lets place amnet's DNS where it sould be in
<filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> so we need to add this:
</para>

<programlisting>
search amnet.co.cr
nameserver 196.40.3.10
</programlisting>

<para>
okey now we need a ppp script for the modem
</para>

<para>
this one works: ( we all use the same username "amnet" and password
"conexion" so for this to work just cut and paste)
</para>

<programlisting>
exec /usr/sbin/pppd /dev/ttyS1 57600 0.0.0.0:0.0.0.0 debug user amnet
defaultroute connect "chat -v TIMEOUT 60 ABORT 'BUSY' ABORT 'NOANSWER' ''
ATH TIMEOUT 60 'OK' ATDT2969130 CONNECT ''"
</programlisting>

<para>
amnet uses PAP (password authentication protocol) to authenticate users
so we need to add a line to <filename>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</filename>:
</para>

<programlisting>
"amnet" * "conexion"
</programlisting>

<para>
okey now you need to bring ppp up so just run that script to check that it
works type: <command>ifconfig</command>, now you should have something like this:
</para>

<programlisting>
ppp0      Link encap:Point-to-Point Protocol
          inet addr:196.40.3.177  P-t-P:196.40.30.114  Mask:255.255.255.255
          UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:7 errors:1 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:1
          TX packets:9 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          Collisions:0
</programlisting>

<important>
<para>
make sure at this point that you do not have eth0 up or it WILL NOT WORK
</para>
</important>

<para>
okey after you have this working type this:
</para>

<programlisting>
ifconfig eth0 up
ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.240
route add -host 10.0.0.1 eth0
</programlisting>

<para>
now type <command>ifconfig</command> you should have something like this:
</para>

<programlisting>
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:00:21:61:7C:F0
          inet addr:10.0.0.1  Bcast:10.255.255.255  Mask:255.255.255.240

          RX packets:5594 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0

          Collisions:0
          Interrupt:11 Base address:0xde00

ppp0      Link encap:Point-to-Point Protocol
          inet addr:196.40.3.142  P-t-P:196.40.30.114  Mask:255.255.255.255

          TX packets:65 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          Collisions:0
</programlisting>

<para>
and voila , your conection is up and running !!
</para>

<para>
some tips:
</para>

<para>
when you are not connected your eth should be DOWN
activate eth only AFTER ppp is running OR IT WILL NOT WORK.
</para>

<para>
To make this you can add the eth up and down scripts to 
<filename>/etc/ppp/ip-up</filename> and
<filename>/etc/ppp/ip-down</filename> scripts ( on debian just place them
on <filename>/etc/ppp/ip-up.d</filename> and
<filename>/etc/ppp/ip-down.d</filename> )
</para>

<para>
<filename>ip-up</filename> should contain this:
</para>

<programlisting>
ifconfig eth0 up
ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.240
route add -host 10.0.0.1 eth0
</programlisting>

<para>
and <filename>ip-down</filename> this:
</para>

<programlisting>
ifconfig eth0 down
</programlisting>

<para>
now here is a WORKING route table that might help you troubleshooting the
system: ( my HOSTN = hostname )

* about using 2.3.x kernels, this are unstable as anyone knows but I found
that the performace with this kernel and amnet is LOUSY ( like a 14K modem )
I DO NOT RECOMEND USING IT, but anyhow if you do use it and you get that
your machine does not have ppp do not panic just upgrade your pppd program,
2.3.x kernels use a split async sync interface so pppd < 2.3.10 will NOT
work.

** sometimes when I'm using the cable modem on windows and I reboot to 
linux the modem gets "stupid" so I need to turn off the modem, the machine, 
then turn on the modem and restart the machine after that it always work. I
have no Idea why this happens but I'm guessing that the ethernet card has
a different hardware address on windows and linux (wierd) and that the modem 
keeps this config on an memory, and that it needs to be cleand up for it to
work, so if it was working on windows and you are not getting even a ping
on linux try this.

I just got a hybrid com21 setup w/ Prime Cable in Chicago, and I have a
very important addition that will save other users (particularly debian
users w/ newer kernels) a LOT of grief:
</para>

<para>
When I initially set everything up, I was able to establish the ppp
connection just fine, but the only things coming back over eth1 were
broadcast packets from an internal (10.0.0.x) network.  After 3 weeks of
extreme frustration, I finally found the solution in the kernel docs under
Documentation/networking/README.sb1000:
</para>

<para>
  Solution -- As root type:
</para>

<programlisting>
echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/cm0/rp_filter'
</programlisting>

<para>
so it can share the same IP address as the ppp0 interface.
</para>

<para>
The boot-time script that sets this normally on debian systems is in
/etc/init.d/networking, in the 'spoofprotect_rp_filter' function.  I simply
added 'echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth1/rp_filter' after it had done
everything else.  To be sure, I also added it to a script I added to
/etc/ppp/ip-up.d that brought eth1 up if I was using the cable connection
(as opposed to my other straight-ppp connection).

<para>
I live in Maryland (Anne Arundel County) where my cable
company is Millennium Digital Media (
 <ulink url="http://millenniumdigitalmd.com/">http://millenniumdigitalmd.com/</ulink>
),
which offers Cable Modem service from Cablespeed (
 <ulink url="http://cablespeed.com/">http://cablespeed.com/</ulink>
).  
Since most areas aren't currently upgraded to 2-way digital service, 
for now they're giving us a General Instruments SURFboard SB2100D 
external (hybrid) cable modem (which includes a 33.6 modem), so you plug 
the cable and phone line right into the cable modem -- no need to use
your own modem or set up ppp or anything.  The modem uses DHCP to 
determine all the settings and connect to the network, so all I have
to do it switch on the modem and it automatically dials up and connects
to the network.  To get Linux working, all I had to do was load and configure
dhcpd (or dhcp-client). Since I'm using Debian, all I ran was:
</para>

<programlisting>
   apt-get install dhcp-client
</programlisting>

<para>
and voila!  I was on the net.
