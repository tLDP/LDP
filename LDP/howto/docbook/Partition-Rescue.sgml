<sect1><title>Beginning</title><sect2><title>What's in</title><para>This mini-HOWTO addresses only the &ldquo;lost partition table&rdquo; problem. This can be when&nbsp;:</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>you have no more access to your computer, with the &ldquo;no operating system&rdquo; message&nbsp;;</para></listitem><listitem><para>you have installed a new system (i.e. Windows) and you see no more Linux, and Windows take up all the capacity of the disk&nbsp;;</para></listitem><listitem><para>you have just partitioned the wrong drive with fdisk (for example in the way of changing your hard drive).</para></listitem></itemizedlist><para>Here you will learn that if you know the right thing and do it, Linux comes usually safe from such things. Windows can, but it's luckier.</para><para>We will first see what you can do <emphasis>before</emphasis> the problem to ease the future recovery and what you must do <emphasis>after</emphasis> to recover. There is little to do to prevent from erasing a disk, usually this is done by automatic Windows or Linux-install ill behaved programs or users mistakes - nothing can be done to prevent this except care, but you are already careful, isn't it&nbsp;?</para><para>It can also be done by the use of MSDOS/Windows fdisk. Avoid it as most as you can, but you probably can't.</para><para>I have done this many times, on my computer and on others' guy computers and restored Linux most of the time and Windows sometimes. I wish you luck&nbsp;!</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>What to do right now&nbsp;?</title><para>If you don't have a problem yet, if you read this by curiosity or just seeking information and you are on a running Linux system, do immediately the following&nbsp;:</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>open a root terminal or xterm&nbsp;;</para></listitem><listitem><para>key in &ldquo;/sbin/fdisk -l&rdquo; (that last character being l for Lima). Then do fdisk -u -l&nbsp;;</para></listitem></itemizedlist><para>You will be gratified by a list of all current partitions on all disks presents on your computer. The second one gives the listing in sectors units in place of cylinder and this is sometime necessary.</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>Write this back on paper (or do &ldquo;/sbin/fdisk -l | lpr&rdquo; and &ldquo;/sbin/fdisk -u -l | lpr&rdquo; to print it) and save it in a safe place for future use.</para></listitem></itemizedlist><para>If you are not the system administrator, you should not be concerned by the problem and can stop reading this.</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>Legal stuff</title><para>This HOWTO is Copyright (c) 2000-2001 by Jean-Daniel Dodin. All rights reserved. You may do (almost) whatever you want with it. I don't care. Just be sure to keep my name intact. I just hope it becomes useful for any person in the Linux community.</para><para>In fact I would like to use a more standard LGPL or like licence, but I'm bound by the initial author license and I can't join him. If you know him or any way to contact him, let me know.</para><para>I am not responsible of any damage on any computer as a result of anyone reading this HOWTO. If you do any damage, _it is YOUR fault, NOT MINE_! Be careful when partitioning disks, and don't make any mistakes, because it can be fatal! Backup all your important data and check that everything you do is correct! What is described here worked on my computer, but it may or may not work on your computer. Although it should work for everyone, I can't guarantee anything. This is the last warning you get: BACKUP IMPORTANT DATA! Or, to put it short: Use at your own risk!</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>What do I must know right now?</title><para>You <emphasis>must</emphasis> know that in case of any major problem with your hard disk, you <emphasis>must</emphasis> stop using it at all in <emphasis>write</emphasis> mode, at least the time necessary to understand what happens. Information there is very volatile...</para><para>If ever, one morning, awaking, you computer say &ldquo;can't load, no system installed&rdquo;, you <emphasis>must not begin reinstalling all the stuff</emphasis>.</para><para>If you have Windows installed, I can't promise you can recover your data, but it's likely you will recover all your Linux stuff, provided it's not located too low in the disk structure. This is because some Windows viruses erases the very first disk cylinder, whatever is on. However I didn't ever experiment such virus and can't say for sure. Try recovering anyway.</para><para>You must also know that I give you all this information only for this -information purpose. Neither I nor any other people but you can be held responsible for any problem your data can have using this info. There are too many different systems on the world for anybody being able to promise anything. I can only wish you luck and hope you, like me, will be happy recovering data.</para></sect2>

<sect1><title>Technical info</title><sect2><title>Disks</title><para>A hard disk is made of sectors numbered from 0 to the max.</para><para>dmesg gives, for example:</para><programlisting><![CDATA[hdb: ST34321A, 4103MB w/128kB Cache, CHS=523/255/63
]]></programlisting><para>CHS means Cylinders, Heads, Sectors.</para><para>523*255*63=8401995 sectors of 512 bytes, thus the 4103&nbsp;Mbytes. This is only a logical map, it's not necessarily what is written on the disk cover (except for the total size).</para><para>The true size of the sectors is of no interest for us given we don't want to modify anything but restore a previous state. For us, the default size given by fdisk is alright.</para><para>The size seen by the system is directly dependent of the work of the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System - the PC's ROM). The mode of the hard disk indicated in the BIOS is essential. On a new disk, it's better to use BIOS automatic hard disk recognition and say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. Anyway, any modification at this level may destroy all the data of the disk, so don't play with this without essential reason. </para><para>This is probably what your disk use, so don't be afraid.</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>Partitions</title><para>Disk are now huge, 40 Gb are not rare, so that it's not really handy to have all this stuff packed in only one part. Only Windows do so, and if you use Linux, may be it's because you are aware of how inefficient the other is.</para><para>So a hard disk is usually cut in some pieces called &ldquo;partitions&rdquo; (see the &ldquo;partition HOWTO&rdquo; for details, also read /usr/share/doc/package/util/README.fdisk)</para><para>Let's get a look at (part of) my own print of fdisk -l&nbsp;:</para><programlisting><![CDATA[Disk /dev/hdb: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 523 cylinders

]]></programlisting><para>Don't worry for the french part, I'm french... look at your own disk listing. Of course numbers are bigger.</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>Why is there a problem&nbsp;?</title><para>Problem is all the installed Operating Systems must share the disks and as at start the BIOS only scan the first one, there must be a so called &ldquo;partition table&rdquo; in the very beginning of this disk. This partition table is located in the Master Boot Record (MBR) side by side with the boot loader.</para><para>Any misuse of the MBR by any of the OS's leads to problems. When trying to install any system, yes answer at a question like &ldquo;automatic partitioning?&rdquo; is likely to give problems... This is specially true with Windows, especially with custom windows installation made by special makes PC's (when no true &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; CD is included, as with many laptops). But it's also true with new &ldquo;smart&rdquo; (not so smart!) Linux installation programs given with some recent distributions.</para></sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1><title>Solving the problem</title><para>Please, beware! following the explanations given here will lead you to turn back to a previous system, loosing all your recent installed one, if any! You must choose...</para><sect2><title>The simpler case</title><para>All is simple if you have at hand&nbsp;:</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>a disk (floppy or CD) able to start Linux by itself with fdisk available - most rescue disks of any distribution can do that,</para></listitem><listitem><para>a paper with the fdisk -l and fdisk -u -l content written down.</para></listitem></itemizedlist><para>It's enough to</para><orderedlist><listitem><para>start Linux&nbsp;;</para></listitem><listitem><para>start fdisk /dev/hda (or whatever is the disk to rescue)&nbsp;;</para></listitem><listitem><para>use fdisk to delete (d option) all the existing partitions on the damaged disk&nbsp;;</para></listitem><listitem><para>use fdisk to create all the primary (1-4) partition mentioned on the paper&nbsp;;</para></listitem><listitem><para>give them the appropriate tag (t option)&nbsp;: 82 is for Linux swap, 83 for Linux main (L gives you the list), 5 is extended and must be done before creating logical partitions, c is Windows Fat 32 and f Windows extended when 6 is Windows Fat 16.</para></listitem><listitem><para>create any logical partition.</para></listitem></orderedlist><para>On my SuSE installation and anytime I had to do this for other peoples, this gives a good result.</para><para>However I was said that some fdisk may cut partitions on a sector basis, not cylinder. So the fdisk -u -l version of the paper.</para><para>For using the fdisk -u -l listing one must start fdisk -u :-). On my opinion, using sector limit is a very bad idea, but it may have a real use I'm not aware of. Problem is that with cylinder limit it's easy to guess even if you don't have paper. With sector one, there a many more guesses...</para><para>fdisk is a small and very smart programs. There are many other makes of fdisk, but I always prefer the bare bone one (I speak of Linux ones, of course, not the others...).</para><para>Be aware that fdisk doesn't write anything to disk before you hit w and return. In case you fear a mistake, hit q (quit) or Ctrl C (^C) to quit safe.</para><para>When your new partition table is written, start your Linux. Chance is you can't do that as usual: lilo can have been damaged also and you will need a boot floppy or booting from a CD (choose the option &ldquo;booting the installed partition&rdquo;).</para><para>If you use to boot with lilo, as soon as you are logged in as root, key in &ldquo;lilo&rdquo; and hit return to reinstall you favorite boot loader.</para><para>Your Linux should be all here, test it. Try also to start Windows if applicable. If you can't, there is a (very little) chance you can read your data from Linux, may be with a raw sector by sector read. If you can identify the disk sectors you data is on, using dd can copy them on a file. This is wise for text only. This recovery is NOT in the scope of this mini-HOWTO.</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>A not so simple case</title><sect3><title>By hand</title><para>This is when the previous case can't be used, for lack of fdisk paper or if it won't run for use of an out of date one.</para><para>First, be aware that as soon as you don't write to the disk (except with fdisk), you can't erase your data, so that you can use a block by block try. That is you need to know the beginning of the partition to start it. If, say a 153 don't fit, try a 154, and so on.</para><para>This can be tiresome, but if you remember approximately the size of the Linux partition, there is a chance to win.</para></sect3>
<sect3><title>Linux own info and other hacks</title><sect4><title>Kernel</title><para>If you just destroyed your own partition table, but have not rebooted Linux: Don't reboot! You can still retrieve the partition information stored in the Kernel:</para><para>cat /proc/partitions gives</para><literallayout>major minor&nbsp; #blocks&nbsp; name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp; 19535040 hda&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2096451 hda1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4980150 hda2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 hda3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <----- this marks an extended partition&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4980118 hda5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4972086 hda6</literallayout></sect4>
<sect4><title>hdparm</title><literallayout>hdparm -g /dev/hda1/dev/hda1: geometry&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 2432/255/63, sectors = 4192902, start = 63</literallayout><para>You'll need to do a few unit conversions. &quot;&num;blocks&quot; are usually 1K in length. &quot;Sectors&quot; are disk sectors, often 512 bytes. But usually the disk partitioning tools work in units of cylinders (here 255*63=16065 sectors). Using this information you can build a new partition table.</para></sect4>
<sect4><title>I know the start of the partition, but not the end.</title><para>If you know the start of a Linux partition, but not the end, you can still mount it, and learn about the structure. Set the partition table start correctly, and set the end to something very large. See if you guessed correctly with:</para><programlisting><![CDATA[e2fsck -n /dev/hd?? 
]]></programlisting><para>You can even mount the partition and check the size:</para><programlisting><![CDATA[mount -r /dev/hd?? /mnt
]]><![CDATA[df -T
]]></programlisting><para>This won't directly tell you where the next partition starts, because of rounding issues. But it can help you get close. Be sure to use the &quot;-n&quot; and &quot;-r&quot; flags to treat the system as read-only!!!</para></sect4>
<sect4><title>Other places partition information is stored</title><para>Some distributions record partition information in a file. Of course you probably won't be able to get to this file when you need it. But just in case:</para><programlisting><![CDATA[SuSE: /var/lib/YaST/install.inf
]]></programlisting><para>(if you are aware of others, please email the maintainer of this document)</para></sect4>
</sect3>
<sect3><title>gpart</title><para>But there is a better way if you can still access the net or have &ldquo;gpart&rdquo; at hand. gpart is available in most distribution, by freshmeat.net or directly at <ulink url="http://www.stud.uni-hannover.de/user/76201/gpart/">http://www.stud.uni-hannover.de/user/76201/gpart</ulink>.</para><para>&ldquo;gpart - guess PC-type hard disk partitions&rdquo; is the first line of the man page of gpart (man gpart).</para><para>&ldquo;gpart tries to guess which partitions are on a hard disk. If the primary partition table has been lost, overwritten or destroyed the partitions still exist on the disk but the operating system cannot access them.&rdquo; This is exactly what we need.</para><para>gpart is a very good tool.</para><para>The problem is the following: the first block of any partition is marked. But it's never &ldquo;unmarked&rdquo; if not overwritten. So many &ldquo;first partition block&rdquo; are existing on an old disk and gpart tries to do it's best guessing what is the good one.
