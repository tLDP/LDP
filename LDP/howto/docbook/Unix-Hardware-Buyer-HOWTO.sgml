<sect2 id="purpose"><title>Purpose and History</title>

<para>The purpose of this document is to give you the background
information you need to be a savvy buyer of Intel hardware for running
Unix.  It is aimed especially at hackers and others with the technical
skills and confidence to go to the mail-order channel, but contains
plenty of useful advice for people buying store-front retail.</para>

<para>This document is maintained and periodically updated as a
service to the net by Eric S. Raymond, who began it for the very best
self-interested reason that he was in the market and didn't believe in
plonking down several grand without doing his homework first (no, I
don't get paid for this, though I have had a bunch of free software
and hardware dumped on me as a result of it!).  Corrections, updates,
and all pertinent information are welcomed at <ulink
url="mailto:esr@snark.thyrsus.com">esr@snark.thyrsus.com</ulink>.  The
editorial `we' reflects the generous contributions of many savvy
Internetters.</para>

<para>If you email me questions that address gaps in the FAQ material,
you will probably get a reply that says ``Sorry, everything I know
about this topic is in the HOWTO''.  If you find out the
<emphasis>answer</emphasis> to such a question, please share it with
me for the HOWTO, so everyone can benefit.</para>

<para>If you end up buying something based on information from this
HOWTO, please do yourself and the net a favor; make a point of telling
the vendor ``The HOWTO sent me'' or some equivalent.  If we can show
vendors that this HOWTO influences a lot of purchasing decisions, we
get leverage to change some things that need changing.</para>

<para>Note that in December 1996 I published an introductory article on
building and tuning Linux systems summarizing much of the material in
this HOWTO.  It's <ulink
url="http://www.netaxs.com/~esr/writings/lj-howtobuild.html">available
here</ulink>.</para>

<para>This document actually dates back to 1992, when it was known as
the ``PC-Clone Unix Hardware Buyer's Guide''; this was before Linux
took over my world :-).  Before that, portions of it were part of 
a Unix Buyer's Guide that I maintained back in the 1980s on USENET.</para>

<sect1 id="overview"><title>Overview of the Market</title>

<para>The central fact about clone hardware that conditions every
aspect of buying it is this: more than anywhere else in the industry,
de-facto hardware standards have created a commodity market with low
entry barriers, lots of competitive pressure, and volume high enough
to amortize a <emphasis>lot</emphasis> of development on the
cheap.</para>

<para>The result is that this hardware gives you lots of
bang-per-buck, and it's getting both cheaper and better all the time.
Furthermore, margins are thin enough that vendors have to be lean,
hungry, and <emphasis>very</emphasis> responsive to the market to
survive.  You can take advantage of this, but it does mean that much
of the info in the rest of this document will be stale in three months
and completely obsolete in six.</para>

<para>One good general piece of advice is that you should avoid both
the highest-end new-technology systems (those not yet shipping in
volume) and the very cheapest systems put out by vendors competing
primarily on price.  The problem with the high end is that it usually
carries a hefty ``prestige'' price premium, and may be a bit less
reliable on average because the technology hasn't been through a lot
of test/improve cycles.  The problem with the low end is that
price-cutters sometimes settle for marginal components.  Unix works
your hardware more efficiently than DOS or Windows, so it is more
sensitive to hardware flakiness, which means cut-price systems that
might deliver consistently for DOS/Windows lemmings can come around
and bite you.  Use a little care, and spend the $200-$300 to stay out
of the basement.  The avoided time and hassles will be worth
it.</para>

<para>The last point deserves a little amplification.  In the PC world,
there's a lot of ``if it doesn't fail, it's OK''.  It is common to ignore
normal engineering tolerances (allowances for variations in components,
temperature, voltage margins, and the like) and to assume that anything
which doesn't fail outright must work.  Watch out!  As a historical
example, the ISA bus was originally designed for 6 MHz.  IBM later updated
that to 8 MHz, and that's as much of a standard as there is, yet there were
motherboards that will let you (try to!)  run it at 12 MHz, 50% over spec.
Some cards were actually designed to work at that speed with proper
tolerances.  Others might work...or they might flake out when they get
warm.  Any systems vendor above the fly-by-night level is going to shoot
for a little more reliability than this, burning in systems and (often)
doing at least a token system test with some kind of Unix (usually Linux
these days).  Pay the few extra bucks it costs to deal with a more careful
vendor.</para>

<para>The happy bottom line is this: at July 2001 direct-mail prices, you
can expect to get an AMD K6 or Pentium III 450 system with 64MB of
memory, 9gig EIDE hard disk, 3.5 floppy, 101-key keyboard, 32X CD-ROM
drive, sound card &amp; speakers, SuperVGA-compatible 17&quot;
monitor, 56KB modem, and a decent AGP video card for $800 or even
less.  This is a more than reasonable Unix and X machine.</para>

<para>I put together the first version of this guide around 1992;
Unix-capable systems are now five to ten times cheaper than they were
then.  At today's prices, building your own system from parts no
longer makes much sense at all -- so this HOWTO is now more oriented
towards helping you configure a whole system from a single vendor.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="basics"><title>Buying the Basics</title>

<para>In this section, we cover things to look out for that are more or less
independent of price-performance tradeoffs, part of your minimum system
for running Unix.</para>

<para>Issues like your choice of disk, processor, and bus (where there is
a strong tradeoff between price and capability) are covered in the section
on <link linkend="performance">performance tuning</link>.</para>

<sect2 id="cases"><title>Getting Down to Cases</title>

<para>I used to say that cases are just bent metal, and that it doesn't
much matter who makes those, as long as they're above an easy minimum
quality (on some <emphasis>really</emphasis> cheap ones, cards fail to line
up nicely with the slots, drive bays don't align with the access cutouts,
or the motherboard is ill-supported and can ground out against the
chassis).</para>

<para>Unfortunately, this isn't true any more.  Processors run so hot these
days that fans and airflow are a serious concern. They need to be well
designed for proper airflow throughout. </para>

<para>If you're fussy about RFI (Radio-Frequency Interference), it's worth
finding out whether the plastic parts of the case have conductive coating
on the inside; that will cut down emissions significantly, but a few cheap
cases omit it.</para>

<para>Look for the following quality features:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Aluminum rather than steel.  It's lighter and conducts
heat better.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Unobstructed air intake with at least one fan each
(in addition to the power supply and processor fans)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>No sharp metal edges. You doon't want to shred
your hands when you're tinkering with things.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>There shouldn't be any hot spots (poor air 
flow).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Sturdy card clips.  Some poorly-designed cases allow cards 
to wiggle out of their slots.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Effective and easy to use mechanisms for attaching hard
drives, CD-ROM, CD-R/W, DVD, tape drive etc.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Should you buy a desktop or tower case?  Our advice is go with
tower unless you're building a no-expansions personal system and
expect to be using the floppies a lot.  Many vendors charge nothing
extra for a tower case and the absolute maximum premium I've seen is
$100.  What you get for that is less desktop clutter, more and bigger
bays for expansion, and often (perhaps most importantly) a beefed-up
power-supply and fan.  Putting the box and its fan under a table is
good for maybe 5db off the effective noise level, too.  Airflow is
also an issue; if the peripheral bays are less cramped, you get better
cooling.  Be prepared to buy extension cables for your keyboard and
monitor, though; vendors almost never include enough flex.</para>

<para>The airflow thing is a good argument for a full- or mid-tower rather
than the `baby tower' cases some vendors offer.  However, smaller
towers are getting more attractive as boards and devices shrink and
more functions migrate onto the motherboard.  A state of the art
system, with all 3&quot; disks, 300W power supply, half-size motherboard,
on-board IDE and 64meg of RAM sockets, and half-sized expansion cards,
will fit into a baby or midized tower with ample room for expansion;
and the whole thing will fit under a desk and make less noise than a
classic tower.</para>

<para>For users with really heavy expansibility requirements,
rackmount PC cases do exist (ask prospective vendors).  Typically a
rackmount case will have pretty much the same functionality as an
ordinary PC case.  But, you can then buy drive racks (complete with
power supply), etc. to expand into.  Also, you can buy passive
backplanes with up to 20 or so slots. You can either put a CPU card in
one of the slots, or connect it to an ordinary motherboard through one
of the slots.</para>

<para>I've recently become a big fan of Antec cases.  They're inexpensive,
sturdy, and thoughtfully engineered.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="power"><title>Power Supplies and Fans</title>

<para>Power supplies can matter but quality is cheap; give preference
to those with a Underwriter's Laboratories rating.  There's some
controversy over optimum wattage level.  On the one hand, you want
enough wattage for expansion.  On the other, big supplies are noisier,
and if you draw too little current for the rating the delivered
voltage can become unstable.  And the expected wattage load from
peripherals is dropping steadily.  On the other hand, processors
and their cooling fans eat a lot more power than they used to.</para>

<para>The choice is generally between 200W and 300W.  After some years of
deprecating 300W-and-up supplies, I'm now persuaded it's time to go back to
them; a modern processor can consume 50-75W by itself, and for the newer
dual-processor board the power supply needs to be rated 450W or up.</para>

<para>Quality brands include PC Power and Cooling, Antec and
Sparkle.  A lot of no-name power supplies are out of spec; this
is an area where buying a name brand is good tactics (the price premium
won't be large).</para>

<para>About that annoying fan noise, ask if the power-supply fan on a
target system has a variable speed motor with thermostatic control;
this will cut down on noise tremendously. However, be aware that a
thermostatic sensor basically measures the temperature <emphasis>at
the sensor</emphasis> (typically within the power supply box) and
makes sure there is enough airflow to keep the power supply from
overheating.  The sensor does not know a thing about the temperature
in certain hot spots likely to develop in a PC case (CPU, between
SIMMs, between drives mounted in vertically adjacent bays).</para>

<para>This can be a problem, because in garden variety tower cases
there often isn't enough airflow to cool all components effectively
even if a single fan is going at full speed.  This is especially true
if your computer has lots of add-on cards or hard disks (not much
airflow between cards or between drives). Note that the fan in the
power supply was basically designed to cool the power supply, not the
components in the case. Not providing additional fans is a sign of
cheapness.  On tower PCs with "expensive" engineering (e.g. HP Vectra,
Compaq) one will find one to two extra fans besides the one in the
power supply.</para>

<para>So the bottom line is, use thermostatic controls if you can to cut
noise.  But if you want high reliability, use two or more fans.  Modern
designs normally also have a small auxilliary fan mounted right over the
chip.</para>

<para>The noise produced by a fan is not just a function of the speed with
which it turns.  It also depends on the nature of the airflow produced by
the fan blades and the bearings of the rotor. If the blades causes lots of
turbulent airflow, the fan produces lots of noise. One brand of fans that
is much more silent than most others even if going at full throttle is

</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="motherboards"><title>Motherboards</title>

<para>Provided you exercise a little prudence and stay out of the
price basement, motherboards and BIOS chips don't vary much in
quality.  There are only six or so major brands of motherboard inside
all those cases and they're pretty much interchangeable; brand
premiums are low to nonexistent and cost is strictly tied to maximum
speed and bus type.  Unless you're buying from a "name" outfit like
Compaq, Dell, or AST that rolls its own motherboards and BIOSes, there
are only four major brands of BIOS chip (AMI, Phoenix, Mylex, Award)
and not much to choose between 'em but the look of the self-test
screens.  One advantage Unix buyers have is that Unixes are built not
to rely on the BIOS code (because it can't be used in protected mode
without more pain than than it's worth).  If your BIOS will boot
properly, you're usually going to be OK.</para>

<para>The old ``AT'' and ``Baby AT'' motherboard form factors are obsolete.
It's an ATX world now.</para>

<para>There are still a few potential gotchas to beware of, especially in
the cheaper off-brand boards.  One is ``shadow RAM'', a trick some
boards use for speeding up DOS by copying the ROM contents into RAM at
startup.  It should be possible to disable this.  Also, on a cacheing
motherboard, you need to be able to disable cacheing in the memory
areas used by expansion cards.  Some cheap motherboards fail to pass
bus-mastering tests and so are useless for use with a good SCSI
interface; on others, the bus gets flaky when its turbo (high-speed)
mode is on.  Fortunately, these problems aren't common and are
becoming less so.</para>

<para>You can avoid both dangerously fossilized hardware and these
little gotchas by sticking with a system or motherboard design that's
been tested with Unix.</para>

<para>Some other good features to look for in a motherboard include:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Gold-plated contacts in the expansion slots and RAM
sockets.  Base-metal contacts tend to grow an oxidation layer which
can cause intermittent connection faults that look like bad RAM chips
or boards.  (This is why, if your hardware starts flaking out, one of
the first things to do is jiggle or remove the boards and reseat them,
and press down on the RAM chips to reseat them as well -- this may
break up the oxidation layer.  If this doesn't work, rubbing what
contacts you can reach with a soft eraser is a good fast way to remove
the oxidation film. Beware, some hard erasers, including many pencil
erasers, can strip off the plating, too!)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The board should be speed-rated as high as your
processor, of course.  It's good if it's rated higher, so upgrade to a
faster processor is just a matter of dropping in the chip and a new
crystal.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Voltage, temperature and fan speed monitoring hardware.
This is now common on motherboards based on recent iterations of the
Intel support chips, especially those designed for server use.
Linux supports drivers that can read this hardware, and monitoring
can help you spot incipient board failures.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>If you're changing a motherboard, see the
<ulink url="http://www.atipa.com/InfoSheets/instmb.shtml">
Installing a Motherboard</ulink> page first.  This one even has a Linux
note.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="memory"><title>Memory</title>

<para>All current PC designs include a cacheing memory controller and some
fast on-chip cache that combine to produce higher effective speeds.
Judging the cache design used to be one of the trickiest parts of the 
motherboard, but that stuff is all baked into the processor itself now.</para>

<para>Current motherboards use PC100 or PC133 SDRAM, which comes packaged
on 168 pin DIMM modules.  SDRAM is a large step forward in memory speed, at
10ns.  SDRAM does not need to be installed in pairs.  The key words you
want to see on the spec sheet are:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>SDRAM DIMM -- the physical module type.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>ECC -- support for error correcting memory, important for 
    reliability; Unix makes more efficient use of hardware and thus beats
    on your memory harder than Windows does.  Be sure your motherboard 
    supports ECC and note that "ECC compatible" is marketing manure 
    for a board that alllows you to use ECC memory but
    <emphasis>doesn't</emphasis> use the ECC.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>PC100 -- this is the memory-module specification for current 
    motherboards with a 100MHz Memory Bus support.  This is minimum; PC133
    or PC266 is better.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>16x72 -- if it says 16x64, the extra 8 bits per 64
    needed for ECC are not present.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>For current motherboards with 133MHz Memory Bus support, PC133 should
be used instead of PC100; it gives 33% greater memory bandwidth at very
little additional cost.  DDR-SDRAM and RDRAM are faster memory types that
retrieve data in chunks and give you faster throughput.  So-called `PC266'
memory is designed for motherboards that transfer at 133 but double the
width of the front-side bus connecting processor and memory.</para>

<para>As the throughput of processor-to-memory buses rises, memory latency
(bus cycles required for the first fetch in a chunk) is becoming a more
important statistic.  Lower numbers are better.</para>

<para>For more technical stuff on memory architectures, see
<ulink url="http://www.kingston.com/king/mg0.htm">The Ultimate Memory
Guide</ulink> maintained by Kingston Technologies.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="video"><title>Buying a Video Card</title>

<para>Video controllers translate byte values deposited in their video
memory by your GUI (usually an X server under Linux) into an analog
RGB signal which drives your monitor.  The simplest kinds treat their
video memory as one big frame buffer, requiring the CPU to do all
dot-painting.  More sophisticated ``accelerated'' cards offer operations
such as BitBlt so your X server can hack the video memory
algorithmically.  These days almost all cards even at the low end
actually have some acceleration features.</para>

<para>Cards are rated by the maximum number of analog signal changes they
can produce per second (video bandwidth).  Video bandwidth can be used
to buy varying combinations of screen resolution and refresh speed, 
depending on your monitor's capabilities.</para>

<para>Another important variable of video cards is the size of their
on-board video RAM. Increased memory lets you run more colors at
higher resolutions. For instance, a 1MB card usually will only allow
256 colors at 1024x768 while a 2MB card usually allows at least 16-bit
color (a palette of about 65,000 colors).  You'll need 4MB of video
memory to use 24-bit or ``true'' color (16 million colors) at
1024x768.</para>

<para>The card's video RAM size has no effect on its speed.  What does
affect speed is the <emphasis>type</emphasis> of memory on board.
VRAM (Video Random Access Memory) is fast but more expensive; it
features a dual-ported design allowing two devices (the CRT controller
and the CPU) to access the memory at the same time.  DRAM (Dynamic
Random Access Memory) is is similar to the RAM used in main memories.
It is cheaper, more common, and slower (because the CRT controller and
the CPU must take turns accessing the video buffer).</para>

<para>The Horizontal and Vertical Frequency columns refer to the
monitor scan frequencies.</para>

<para>The vertical frequency is the upper limit of the monitor's
flicker rate; 60Hz is minimal for ergonomic comfort, 72Hz is
VESA-recommended, and 80Hz is cutting-edge.  At resolutions above VGA,
horizontal scans take long enough that the monitor may never reach
anywhere near the vertical-frequency maximum; how close it gets is a
function of the horizontal-scan frequency (higher is better).</para>

<para>For more information on how to avoid the evil screen flicker, 
see the <ulink url="&howto;XFree86-Video-Timings-HOWTO/">XFree86 Video
Timings HOWTO</ulink>, a tutorial written by your humble editor
and included with the XFree86 distribution.</para>

<para>It's no longer possible to find MDA video boards and monitors out
there.  Anyway, prices for SVGA have collapsed so totally that it's
wouldn't be worth bothering.</para>

<para>XGA is an IBM-proprietary included for completeness, but is
vanishingly rare in the clone market.  8514/A is another IBM standard
supported by a few graphics accelerator cards.  It is interlaced, and
thus has a tendency to flicker.  The VESA 1024x768 standard makes XGA
and 8514/A obsolete.</para>

<para>SVGA or `Super VGA' strictly refers only to 800x600 resolution,
but is widely used for 1024x768 and even 1280x1024 resolutions.
Standards above 1024x768 are weak and somewhat confused.</para>

<para>These days, most vendors bundle a 15&quot; or 17&quot; monitor and
super-VGA card with 1024x768 resolution in with their systems.  Details to
watch are the amount of RAM included (which will affect how much of that
maximum resolution and how many colors you actually get), and whether the
memory is dual-ported VRAM (slightly more expensive but much
faster).</para>

<itemizedlist> 
<listitem><para>Dot pitch of 0.28 or smaller on a 12&quot;-15&quot; monitor;
0.30 is acceptable on larger ones, especially 19&quot; to 21&quot; screens (but
look extra hard at 0.25 21-inchers like the Viewsonic 21PS or Nokia
445X).  Dot pitch is the physical resolution of the screen's phosphor
mask.  Larger dot pitches mean that small fonts and graphic details
will be fuzzy.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>72Hz or better vertical scan frequency, to cut
flicker.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Non-interlaced display.  Interlacing cuts the required
scan frequency for a given resolution in half, but makes flicker twice
as bad.  As a result, interlaced monitors are rapidly disappearing;
don't get stuck with one.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Does it have a tilt-and-swivel base?  Adequate
controls, including both horizontal and vertical size and horizontal
and vertical centering?  A linearity control, a trapezoidal control,
and a color-temperature control are all pluses; the last is
particularly important if you compose graphics on screen for hardcopy
from a printer.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>For X use, a 14&quot;, .28mm dot pit, non-interlaced 72Mhz
monitor at 640x480 resolution is the bare minimum for comfortable use, and
that resolution leaves you rather squeezed for screen real estate.
1024x768 is much better.  If your budget will stand it at all, a 17&quot;
or 20&quot; monitor is a good investment.  A 17&quot; monitor is minimum if
you're going to go with 1280x1024 of 1600x1200
resolution.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>If you can, buy your monitor from someplace that will let you
see the same monitor (the very unit you will walk out the door with,
not a different or `demo' unit of the same model) that will be on your
system.  There's a lot of quality variation (even in "premium" monitor
brands) even among monitors of the same make and model.</para>

<para>Another good reason to see before you buy, and carry it home
yourself, is that a lot of monitors are vulnerable to bumps.  The yoke
can get twisted, producing a disconcerting tilt in the screen
image.</para>

<sect3><title>Eric Buys A Big Monitor: Smart Shopping Tips</title>

<para>In early 1996 the good folks at O'Reilly Associates dropped
several $1000 checks on me in relatively quick succession (payment for
fast-turnaround technical reviews).  I decided to use the money to
treat myself to a really good monitor. </para>

<para>This page tells you how I did it.  Specific specs and pricing
information will date quickly, but the method should still be good
years from now. </para>

<para>My existing monitor wasn't bad -- a 17-inch Swan 617 that I
could drive at a bit above 1024x768.  Still, I yearned for more real
estate -- especially vertical real estate, so I could view full
PostScript pages using a legible font. </para>

<para>This brings us to our first prescription: <emphasis>be clear
about what you want</emphasis>.  It's easy, and very expensive, to buy
more monitor than you'll really use.</para>

<para>I knew I wanted something in the 19-to-21-inch range, with
1280x1024 or higher resolution.  I knew this would probably cost me
about $2000, and could afford it.  I knew I
<emphasis>didn't</emphasis> need one of the monster projection
monitors further upmarket, with screen sizes 24&quot; and up.  These
will typically cost you $4K or so and are too big for desktop use
anyway. </para>

<para>I also knew I didn't need one of the special true-color monitors
designed for photo composition, making print separations, and so
forth.  These creatures (always Trinitrons) have better, denser color
than conventional tubes but at a hefty price premium (and usually at
some cost in available resolution).  If all you're going to do most of
the time is 16 or 256-color X screens, you don't need this
capability.</para>

<para>Once you've settled on what you need, <emphasis>gather comparative
data</emphasis>.  It was 1996, so I started out by making
phone calls to manufacturer 800 numbers.  Then I discovered that
almost all the manufacturers had Web sites, with technical specs for
their monitors on them. Today, you'd go to the Web first. </para>

<para>(This space used to include detailed technical data on what I
found &quot; model numbers, resolutions, reviews of manufacturer
websites, etc.&quot; but I've removed it because it's all five years
out of data now.)</para>

<para>This wasn't at all a hard call.  The ViewSonic 21PS and Nokia
445X stood out from the pack immediately; their combination of high
bandwidth with a 21-inch screen size and ultra-fine .25 dot pitch
promised better performance than the general run of .28-pitch
monitors. </para>

<para>Nor was the choice between the two very hard.  ViewSonic's 21PS
is $600 less expensive than Nokia's 445X for very similar performance.
And, other things being equal, I'd rather buy a monitor from a
specialist monitor manufacturer than a general consumer electronics
outfit best known for its cellular phones. </para>

<para>So I determined to order a ViewSonic 21PS. </para>

<para>This left me with a second problem.  My ATI Mach 32 can't drive
a monitor at higher than 1280x1024 resolution and 94MHz bandwidth.  So
it wouldn't be able to drive the 21PS at 1600x1200. I wound up buying
a Mach 64.</para>

<para>The combination worked wonderfully (two years later I discovered
that <ulink url="http://www.valinux.com">VA Linux Systems</ulink> bought the
same monitor for its high-end systems).  The only problem I have with
it is that monitor is <emphasis>way</emphasis> bright even dialed down
to its dimmest setting.  You'll need a strong light in the room where
you install it.  Also, be aware that the only really convenient way to
move one of these monster monitors is with a forklift! </para>

<para>It's important to get a high quality keyboard with good key

<para>Hal Snyder of Mark Williams, Co sent us the following caveat:
"We find that about 10% of cheap no-name keyboards do not work in scan
code set 3.  We are interested in scan code set 3 because only there
can you reprogram the keyboard on a per-key basis as to whether keys
are make-only, make-break, or autorepeat.  It is a big win for
international support and for X."</para>

<para>He continues: "Keytronic, Cherry, and Honeywell keyboards, as
well as a large number of imports, work fine.  My advice is to either
buy a respected brand of keyboard, or deal with a vendor who will
allow you to return an incompatible keyboard without charge."</para>

<para>Following the wave of mid-1990s publicity about repetitive-strain

looks promising to your editor (though I haven't yet used it) is the
Marquardt MiniErgo MF2, from Marquardt Switches, Inc.; 2711 Route 20 East,
Cazanovia NY 13035, phone (315)-655-8050; suggested list price $170,
AT-compatible interface). Michael Scott Shappe &lt;mshappe@jeeves.net&gt;
sent me a rave review of the Marquardt after having used it about six
months.</para>

<para>The MF2 features a conventional QWERTY layout, but with the
right and left halves split apart and rotated about 30 degrees towards
each other in a shallow V shape.  The theory is that being able to
angle your arms inward and your elbows out produces a less stressful
typing position.</para>

<para>The MF2 has no keypad, but it does have the standard 12 function
keys across the top and arrow keys at the point of the V (meant to be
thumb-operated).</para>

<para>I have seen and used a device called the Maltron ergonomic
keyboard.  This keyboard splits the keys into two main groups, each
arranged in a dished hollow.  Each hand also has easy access to
separate thumb pads of nine keys each; there is one numeric and
arrow-key pad in the center of the unit, between the right and
left-hand groups.  Also, the keys in each group do *not* have the
alternate-row staggering of the conventional (Scholes) keyboard; this
subtle change reduces torsional stress on the fingers and wrists
tremendously.</para>

<para>I found the Maltron easy to use, and regretted having to give it
back.</para>

<sect2 id="floppies"><title>Floppy Drives</title>

<para>There's not much to be said about floppy drives.  They're cheap,
they're generic, and the rise of CD-ROM drives as a cheap distribution
medium has made them much less important than formerly.  You only ever see
the 3.5-inch `hard-shell' floppies with 1.44MB capacity anymore.</para>

<para>You'll probably never use floppies for anything but first boot of a
new operating system.  Bootable CD-ROMs, standard of most PCs these days,
eliminate even that use.  So go ahead and settle for cheap Mitsumi and Teac
floppy drives.  There are no `premium' floppy drives anymore.  Nobody

<sect2 id="printers"><title>Printers</title>

<para>There's one huge gotcha about printers: <emphasis>Don't Get a `GDI'
printer</emphasis>!</para>

<sect3 id="gdi"><title>GDI printers: avoid!</title>

<para>Low-end printer manufacturers have been increasingly moving
towards `GDI' or `Windows' printers for their laser or LED models.
These have the unfortunate characteristic of being, at worst, unusable
from Unix; and at best, useable only with reduced resolution (e.g.,
300 dpi from a 600 dpi printer).</para>

<para>The problem is that the design of laser printers inherently 
requires that data move onto the imaging drum at a precisely-controlled 
rate, and so laser (and LED) printers have traditionally included a CPU 
of moderate speed and enough RAM to image an entire page, either as a 
complete bitmap or as ASCII, using a quick font rasterizer to form images 
on-the-fly.  GDI printers, however, offload this responsibility to the 
computer, and therefore require very specialized drivers that (a) are not 
available for any Unix, AFAIK; and (b) slow down the computer a lot when 
printing is underway.</para>

<para>Most GDI printers DO support HP's PCL in a lower resolution, so
they can often be used from Unix via Ghostscript, but only in 300 dpi
and/or missing some features.  They may also be slower in this mode
than in their native GDI modes.  In order to print at 600 dpi with
Ghostscript, a PCL printer must support HP's PCL at level 5e or
better, so printer purchasers should look for that in any
non-PostScript model, at least at the moment. (Naturally, all of this
could change if/when support is added to Ghostscript for more esoteric
models; but AFAIK, this is the current set of limitations.)</para>

<para>Finally, I've seen one extra twist on this already-twisted
marketplace: The Brother HL-720 is advertised as supporting `PCL 5e
for DOS' (or words to that effect).  What this means is that it's a
GDI model with a DOS driver that takes PCL 5e input and translates it
to the printer's native GDI mode.  Needless to say, this is useless
for Unix.</para>

<para>GDI printers are a bad design even for the DOS lemmings, because they
slow the machine down significantly while printing is going on.  Like
`WinModems', they're a sleazy way for manufacturers to save a few
bucks.  Our advice is, buy a printer with native Postscript and avoid
all this crap.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="nongdi"><title>Non-GDI printers</title>

<para>There really isn't all that much to be said about printers; the market is
thoroughly commoditized and printer capabilities pretty much independent
of the rest of your hardware.  The PC-clone magazines will tell you what
you need to know about print quality, speed, features, etc.  The business
users they feed on are obsessed with all these things.</para>

<para>Most popular printers are supported by GhostScript, and so it's easy
to make them do PostScript.  If you're buying any letter-quality
printer (laser or ink-jet), check to see if it's on GhostScript's
supported device list -- otherwise you'll have to pay a premium for
Postscript capability!  Postscript is still high-end in the MS-DOS
market, but it's ubiquitous in the Unix world.</para>

<para>Warning, however: if you're using ghostscript on a non-Postscript
printer, printspeed will be slow, especially with a serial
printer.  A bitmapped 600 dpi page has a <emphasis>lot</emphasis> of pixels on
it. Further, if you're doing much printing, ghostscript will create enormous
spool files. (megabytes/page).  At today's prices, paying the $750 
or so for Postscript capability makes sense.</para>

<para>If you're buying a printer for home, an inkjet is a good choice
because it doesn't use gobs of power and you won't have the
toner/ozone/noise/etc mess that you do with a laser.  If all
you want is plain-ASCII, dot-matrix is cheaper to buy and run.</para>

<para>Inkjets are great in that they're cheap, many of them do color, and
there are many kinds which aren't PCL but are understood by
Ghostscript anyway.  If you print very infrequently (less than weekly,
say), you should be careful to buy a printer whose print head gets
replaced with every ink cartrige: infrequent use can lead to the
drying of the ink, both in the ink cartrige and in the print head.
The print heads you don't replace with the cartrige tend to cost
nearly as much as the printer (~$200 for an Epson Stylus 800) once the
warranty runs out (the third such repair, just after the warranty
expired, totalled one informant's Stylus 800).  Be careful, check
print head replacement costs ahead of time, and run at least a
cleaning cycle if you don't actually print anything in a given week.
(Conversely, toner starts out dry, and ribbon ink won't evaporate for
years...if you truly print only rarely, but neither a dot matrix nor a
laser makes sense, consider buying no printer and taking your
PostScript files to a copy shop...)</para>

<para>A parallel interface is a cheap way to make your printer
print a lot faster than a serial line, and everyone's got a parallel port
in their PC.</para>

<para>A few printers for the MS-DOS market require a special
controller card and proprietary cable to do PostScript.  These require
MS-DOS software and typically won't run under Unix at all.</para>

<para>Meanwhile, there are several true 600 dpi lasers that grok PCL 5e, yet
cost less than $500 retail.  Currently (December 1997) these include
the Lexmark Optra E (and E+), the HP 5L (and 5L with suffix, and
probably 6L), and the Brother 760.  As you can't easily buy a new hard
drive smaller than 2 gigabytes, tens of megabytes of spare space in
/var/spool should be the accepted norm, rather than a problem, for new
systems; I've also noticed that PCL 5e seems to include some amount of
compression (probably RLE or font encoding) which works rather well
for text, further reducing the spool requirements.</para>

<para>One of our spies says good things about the Canon BJC-240 and 250. He
reports they preint well with Ghostscript and are more reliable than
Deskjets.</para>

<para>I personally have a LaserJet 6MP, and like it.</para>

<sect2 id="power_protection"><title>Power Protection</title>

<sect3><title>Overview</title>

<para>Finally, I strongly recommend that you buy a power conditioner
to protect your hardware.  MOV-filtered power bars make nice fuses
(they're cheap to replace), but they're not enough.</para>

<para>The technical info in the remainder of this section is edited
from material supplied by David E. Wexelblat
&gt;dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com&lt;.</para>

<para>There are several levels of power protection available to the
home computer user.  I break this down into 4 levels; others may have
different ways of classifying things.  The levels are:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Surge Suppressor</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Line Conditioners</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Standby Power Supplies</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Uninterruptible Power Supplies</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>And here's what they mean:</para>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="surge"><title>Surge suppressors</title>

<para>These are basically a fancy fuse between the source and your
hardware; they clamp down spikes, but can't fill in a low voltage
level or dropout.</para>

<para>This is a bare minimum level of protection that any piece of
expensive electronics should have.  Note that this applies to more
than just AC power; surge suppressors are available for (and should be
used on) phone lines, and RS-232 and parallel connections (for use on
long lines; generally not needed if the devices is colocated with the
computer and all devices are protected from outside sources).  Note
also that <emphasis>all</emphasis> devices connected to your computer
need to be protected; if you put a surge suppressor on your computer
but not your printer, then a zap on the printer may take out the
computer, too.</para>

<para>An important fact about surge suppressors is that <emphasis>they
need to be replaced if they absorb a large surge</emphasis>.  Besides
fuses, most suppressors rely on on components called Metal-Oxide
Varistors (or MOVs) for spike suppression, which degrade when they
take a voltage hit.  The problem with cheap suppressors is that they
don't tell you when the MOV is cooked, so you can end up with no spike
protection and a false sense of security. Better ones have an
indicator.</para>

<para>You can buy surge suppressors at any Radio Shack; for better prices, go
mail-order through Computer Shopper or some similar magazine.  All of
these are low-cost devices ($10-50).</para>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="conditioners"><title>Line Conditioners</title>

<para>These devices filter noise out of AC lines.  Noise can degrade
your power supply and cause it to fail prematurely.  They also protect
against short voltage dropouts and include surge suppression.</para>

<para>My Tripp-Lite 1200 was typical of the better class of line
conditioners; a box with a good big soft-iron transformer and a
couple of moby capacitors in it and <emphasis>no</emphasis> conductive
path between the in and out sides.  With one of these, you can laugh
at brownouts and electrical storms. You can get for $139 or so by mail
order.  A fringe benefit of this little beauty is that if you
accidentally pull your plug out of the wall you may find you actually
have time to re-connect it before the machine notices (I did this
once).  But a true SPS or UPS is better.</para>

<para>Netter Trey McLendon has good things to say about Zero Surge
conditioners.  He says: "Our systems at work [...]  have been
protected for 2.5 years now through many a violent storm...one strike
knocked [out] the MOV-type suppressors on a Mac dealer's training
setup across the street from us.  The Zero Surge just sort of buzzed
when the surge came in, with no interruption whatsoever.  The basic
principle is this: ZS units slow down the surge with a network of
passive elements and then sends it back out the neutral line, which is
tied to ground _outside at the box_ by code.  MOV units shunt the
surge to ground _at the computer_, where it leaps across serial ports,
network connections, etc. doing its deadly work."</para>

<para>Price vary widely, from $40-400, depending on the power rating
and capabilities of the device.  Mail-order from a reputable supply
house is your best bet.  Line conditioners typically
<emphasis>don't</emphasis> need to be replaced after a surge; check to
see if yours includes MOVs.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="sps"><title>Standby power supplies (SPSs)</title>

<para>These devices are battery-based emergency power supplies that
provide power for your system via an inverter if the power fails. An
SPS will generally have all the capabilities of a line conditioner as
well.</para>

<para>Note: these devices do not come on line until after the power
fails, and have a certain amount of delay (typically some
milliseconds) before they come on line.  If the capacitors in your
power supply are not large enough, the SPS may not cut in soon enough
to prevent your computer from seeing the power failure.</para>

<para>Note also that many SPSs are marketed as Uninterruptable Power
Supplies (see below).  This is incorrect.  Any device with a non-zero
cutover time cannot be a true UPS.  If the ad mentions a cutover time,
it's an SPS, and not a UPS.</para>

<para>The price range for these devices (increasing with increasing
peak load capacity and with decreasing cutover time) is $200-2000.  An
SPS will <emphasis>not</emphasis> need to be replaced after absorbing
a large surge.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="ups"><title>Uninterruptable power supplies (UPSs)</title>

<para>These devices provide full-time isolation from the incoming AC
line through a transformer of some sort.  These devices are on-line at
all times, and if the AC line fails, the batteries will cut in.  Your
devices will see no interruption of their incoming AC.  UPSs cost
more, and provide more features.  They are the ultimate in power
protection.  Many UPSs have an intelligent interface that will notify
a connected device of a power failure, allowing it to shut down
cleanly.  UPSs also provide the capabilities of a line
conditioner. The price range (for devices in the size range for a home
computer) are $200-$1500.  An UPS will <emphasis>not</emphasis> need
to be replaced after absorbing a large surge.</para>

<para>Now, given this information, how does one decide what to get?
For a system that runs unattended, like most Unix systems, it is best
to have a device that provides both power holdover and a power failure
signal.  Hence, for a Unix system, a UPS or SPS with Unix monitoring
software is the best choice.  </para>

<para>If the vendor isn't secretive about interface specs, it's fairly
simple to write your own daemon to monitor a serial port, and send
init a SIGPWR signal when it sees a powerdown notification on the
port.  Freeware power-monitor demons are available for Linux.</para>

<para>Many UPS/SPS signal ports work by asserting a pin, so that one
could use a modem-control serial port on the PC and wire this pin to
"Carrier Detect" in order to monitor it. Some, like the APC "SmartUPS"
series, actually conduct an ASCII dialog with the host through a serial line
in order to accomplish the monitor functions.</para>

<para>Our recommendation for a production Unix environment is a
configuration like the following:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>An on-line UPS or SPS for the computer system.  An intelligent
interface is mandatory, along with appropriate software for
ordered shutdown.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Surge suppression on all phone lines, and also on serial/parallel
lines that leave the room.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Line conditioners on any devices not connected to the UPS.  If
you do take a power hit, it's cheaper to replace a $50 line
conditioner than a $1500 laser printer.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>If this is too expensive for you, then downgrade the UPS/SPS to
a line conditioner like the TrippLite.  But don't go without at least
that.  Running unprotected is false economy, because you
<emphasis>will</emphasis> lose equipment to electrical storms &mdash;
and, Murphy's Law being what it is, you will always get hit at the
worst possible time.</para>

<para>An important question is "How do I know how big a UPS/SPS to
get?"  The watt rating of the UPS/SPS should be at least the sum of
the peak ratings off all equipment connected to it (don't forget the
console monitor).  Power-supply marketroids tend to quote you
capacities and formulas like "sum of VA ratings + 20%" which
(surprise!) push you towards costlier hardware.  Ignore them.  If a
watt rating is not given, watts = 0.75*VAmax.</para>

<para>One other consideration is that you typically shouldn't put a
laser printer on a UPS &mdash; toner heaters draw enough current to
overload a UPS and cause a shutdown within seconds.  The other thing
is that you can't even put the laser printer on the same circuit with
a UPS &mdash; the heater kicks on every 20-30 seconds, and most UPSs
will see the current draw as a brownout.  So buy a separate line
conditioner for the laser printer.</para>

<para>Finally, read the UPS's installation manual carefully if you're going
to use it with other power-protection devices.  Some UPSs don't like having
surge suppressors between them and the equipment.</para>

<para>David personally recommends surge suppressors and line conditioners from
Tripp-Lite (available both mail-order and retail), and UPSs from Best Power
Technologies (Necedah, WI - 1-(800)-356-5737).  I can enthusiastically second
the TrippLite recommendation, but haven't dealt with Best Power at all.</para>

<para>Tripp-Lite has a whole range of products, from a $10 phone-line
surge-suppressor, to line conditioners and SPSs with prces in the hundreds of
dollars.  They have a line of $50-80 line conditioners that are good for most
peripherals (including your home stereo :->).</para>

<para>Best Power Technologies sells two lines of UPSs in the range for
home systems.  The older and more expensive FERRUPS line (which is
what David has) has a smart interface, and very good filtering and
surge-suppression capabilities.  He says "I have a 1.15kVA FERRUPS for
my home system, which is overkill with my current hardware (although
it rode out a 45 minute power failure with nary a whisper - no
reboot).  In 1990, I paid ~$1600 for this device, and that has since
gone up.  They also sell a newer line of Fortress UPSs.  These are
better suited in price for home systems.  I don't know much about
them, as they were not available when I bought my UPS.  I expect that
this is what most people will want to consider, though.  In addition,
Best sells Check-UPS, a software package (in source form) for
monitoring the UPS and shutting it down.  I have found Best to be a
good company to deal with, with competent, knowledgeable sales people
(who will be able to help you pick the right device), and helpful,
courteous, and responsive technical support."</para>

<para>Other things to know:</para>

<para>A UPS should be wired directly to (or plugged directly into) the
AC supply (i.e. a surge suppressor is neither required nor suggested
between the wall and the UPS).  In addition, a surge suppressor
between the UPS and the equipment connected to it is redundant.</para>

<sect2 id="rfi"><title>Radio Frequency Interference</title>

<para>(Thanks to Robert Corbett &lt;Robert.Corbett@Eng.Sun.COM&gt; for
contributing much of this section)</para>

<para>Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is a growing problem with
PC-class machines.  Today's processor speeds (above 33MHz) are such
that the electromagnetic noise generated by a PC's circuitry in normal
operation can degrade or jam radio and TV reception in the
neighborhood.  Such noise is called Radio Frequency Interference
(RFI).  Computers, as transmitting devices, are regulated by the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC).</para>

<para>FCC regulations recognize two classes of computer:</para>

<para>If a PC is to be used in a home or apartment, it must be
certified to be FCC class B.  If it is not, neighbors have a legal
right to prevent its use.  FCC class A equipment is allowed in
industrial environments.</para>

<para>Many systems are not FCC class B.  Some manufacturers build
boxes that are class B and then ship them with class A monitors or
external disk drives.  Even the cables can be a source of RFI.</para>

<para>It pays to be cautious.  For example, the Mag MX17F is FCC class
B.  There are less expensive versions of the MX17 that are not.  The
Mag MX17 is a great monitor (I wish I had one).  It would be painful
to own one and not be allowed to use it.</para>

<para>An upgradeable system poses special problems.  A system that is
FCC class B with a 33 MHz CPU might not be when the CPU is upgraded to
a 50 or 66 MHz CPU.  Some upgrades require knockouts in the case to be
removed.  If a knockout is larger than whatever replaces it, RFI can
leak out through the gap.  Grounded metal shims can eliminate the
leaks.</para>

<para>Even Class B systems don't mix well with wireless phonesets (not cellular
phones, but the kind with a base station and antennaed headset).  You'll often 
find a wireless phone hard to use withing 20 feet of a Class B machine.</para>

<para>To cut down on RFI, get a good metal case with tight joints, or at
least make sure any plastic one you buy has a conductive lining.  You
can also strip the painted metal-to-metal contacting parts of paint so
that there's good conductive metal contact.  Paint's a poor conductor
in most cases, so you can get some benefit from this.</para>

<para>Right now (mid-2001), the chips to consider for running Unix are the

</sect2>
<sect2 id="buswars"><title>Bus Wars</title>

<para>This is yet another area in which progress has simplified your
choices a lot.  There used to be no fewer than four competing bus
standards out there (ISA, EISA, VESA/VLB, PCI, and PCMCIA).  Now there
are effectively just two -- PCI for desktop/tower machines and PCMCIA
for laptops.</para>

<sect3 id="bustypes"><title>Bus Types</title>

<para>PCI is Intel's fast 64-bit bus for the Pentium.  Many PCI boards
are actually PCI/ISA that supports both standards, so you can use less
expensive ISA peripherals and controllers.  The tradeoff is that dual-bus
boards lose about 10% of their performance relative to single-bus PCI
boards.</para>

<para>I used to recommend these dual-bus boards, but no longer do.  The
on-board USB support and PS/2 mouse port now common on motherboards made
the difference, it means you no longer need ISA even internally (and PCI
cards are cheap these days).  For your desktop machine, go PCI-only.</para>

<para>Try to find a motherboard that drives the PCI bus at 66MHz rather
than the more typical 33MHz.  But that's a minor issue nowadays; the
peripherals that dump really large volumes of data (disks, graphics cards)
will do direct-memory access or have their own dedicated high-speed bus
(like AGP).</para>

<para>In the laptop market everything is PCMCIA.  PCMCIA peripherals are
about the size of credit cards (85x54mm) and vary in thickness between
5 and 10mm.  They have the interesting feature that they can be
hot-swapped (unplugged out and plugged in) while the computer is on.
However, they are seldom seen in desktop machines.  They require a
special daemon to handle swapping, which is now standard under
Linux.</para>

</sect3>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="diskwars"><title>Disk Wars: IDE vs. SCSI</title>

<sect3><title>Overview</title>

<para>Another basic decision is IDE vs. SCSI.  Either kind of disk
costs about the same, but the premium for a SCSI card varies all over
the lot, partly because of price differences between VLB and PCI SCSI
cards and especially because many motherboard vendors bundle an IDE
chipset right on the system board.  SCSI gives you better speed and
throughput and loads the processor less, a win for larger disks and an
especially significant consideration in a multi-user environment; also
it's more expandable.</para>

<para>In terms of pure disk speed, IDE will always be faster, as they use
the same underlying disks, and IDE has less overhead.  As fast as disks
are getting today, the difference is effectively noise.  The real
advantage of SCSI comes from its extra brains.  IDE uses polled I/O,
which means that when you are accessing the disk, the CPU isn't doing
anything else.  Most SCSI systems, on the other hand, are DMA based,
freeing up the system to do other things at the same time.  Hence, in
terms of full system performance, SCSI is indeed faster if you have
good hardware and an intelligent OS.</para>

<para>Another important win for SCSI is that it handles multiple devices
much more efficiently.  You can have at most two IDE devices; four
for EIDE.  SCSI permits up to 7 (15 for wide SCSI).</para>

<para>If you have two IDE drives, only one can transfer between memory and
disk at once.  In fact, you have to program them at such a low level that
one drive might actually be blocked from <emphasis>seeking</emphasis> while
you're talking to the other drive.  SCSI drives are mostly autonomous and
can do everything at once; and current SCSI drives are not quite fast
enough to flood more than half the SCSI bus bandwidth, so you can have at
least two drives on a single bus pumping full speed without using it up.
In reality, you don't keep drives running full speed all the time, so you
should be able to have 3-4 drives on a bus before you really start feeling
bandwidth crunch.</para>

<para>Of course, IDE is cheaper.  Many motherboards have IDE right on board
now; if not, you'll pay maybe $15 for an IDE adapter board, as opposed
to $200+ for the leading SCSI controller.  Also, the cheap SCSI
cabling most vendors ship can be flaky.  You have to use expensive
high-class cables for consistently good results.  See <link
linkend="sutton">Mark Sutton's horror story</link>.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3><title>Enhanced IDE</title>

<para>These days you seldom see plain IDE; souped-up variants are more
usual.  These are "Enhanced IDE" (E-IDE) and "Fast AT Attachment"
(usually ATA for short).  ATA is Seagate's subset of E-IDE, excluding
some features designed to permit chaining with CD-ROMs and tape drives
using the new "ATAPI" interface (an E-IDE extension; so far only the
CD-ROMs exist); in practice, ATA and E-IDE are identical.</para>

<para>You'll need to be careful about chaining in CD-ROMs and tape
drives when using IDE/ATA.  The IDE bus sends all commands to all
disks; they're supposed to latch, and each drive then checks to see
whether it is the intended target.  The problem is that badly-written
drivers for CD-ROMs and tapes can collide with the disk command set.
It takes expertise to match these peripherals.</para>

<para>Neither ATA nor E-IDE has the sustained throughput capacity of
SCSI (they're not designed to) but they are 60-90% faster than plain
old IDE.  E-IDE's new ``mode 3'' boosts the IDE transfer rate from
IDE's 3.3MB/sec to 13.3MB/sec.  The new interface supports up to 4
drives of up to 8.4 gigabytes capacity.</para>

<para>E-IDE and ATA are advertised as being completely compatible with
old IDE.  Theoretically, you can mix IDE, E-IDE and ATA drives and
controllers any way you like, and the worst result you'll get is
conventional IDE performance if the enhancements don't match up (the
controller picks the lowest latch speed).  In practice, some IDE
controllers (notably the BusLogic) choke on enhanced IDE.</para>

<para>Accordingly, I recommend against trying to mix device types an
an E-IDE/ATA bus.  Unfortunately, this removes much of E-IDE/ATA's
usefulness!</para>

<para>E-IDE on drives above 540MB does automatic block mapping to fool the
BIOS about the drive geometry (avoiding limits in the BIOS type tables).
They don't require special Unix drivers.</para>

<para>Many motherboards now support ``dual EIDE'' channels, i.e. two separate
[E]IDE interfaces each of which can, theoretically, support two IDE
disks or ATA-style devices.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="scsi_terms"><title>SCSI Terminology</title>

<para>The following, by Ashok Singhal
&lt;ashoks@duckjibe.eng.sun.com&gt; of Sun Microsystems with additions
by your humble editor, is a valiant attempt to demystify SCSI
terminology.</para>

<para>The terms ``SCSI'', ``SCSI-2'', and ``SCSI-3'' refer to three different
specifications.  Each specification has a number of options. Many of these
options are independent of each other.  I like to think of the main options
(there are others that I'll skip over because I don't know enough about them to
talk about them on the net) by classifying them into five categories:</para>

<sect4><title>Logical: SCSI-1, SCSI-2, SCSI-3</title>

<para>This refers to the commands that the controllers understand.  You'll
no longer see SCSI-1 in new hardware. SCSI-3 is a superset of SCSI-2
including commands intended for CD-R and streaming multimedia
devices.</para>

</sect4>
<sect4><title>Electrical Interface</title>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>single-ended (max cable length 6 meters)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>differential (max cable length 25 meters)</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>This option is independent of command set, speed, and path width.
Differential is less common but allows higher transfer speeds, better noise
immunity and longer cables.  It's rare in SCSI-1 controllers.</para>

<para>You will normally see single-ended SCSI controllers on
low-speed devices such as tapes and CD drives, and differential
SCSI on hard drives (look for the specification LVD which means
"low-voltage differential").</para>

<para>Nowadays most controllers support both electrical interfaces, but if
you mix LVD with single-ended on the same chain, the whole chain will fall
back to single-ended (and possibly halve the speed of the faster
devices).</para>

</sect4>
<sect4><title>Handshake</title>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Asynchronous (acknowledge each word (8, 16 or 32 bits) transferred.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Synchronous (multiple-word transfers permitted between ACKS).</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Synchronous is faster.  This mode is negotiated between controller
and device; modes may be mixed on the same bus.  This is independent
of command set, data width, and electrical interface.</para>

</sect4>
<sect4><title>Synchronous Speed (does not apply for asynchronous option)</title>

<para>Normal transfer speed is 5 megabytes/sec.  The ``fast'' option
(10 mb/sec) is defined only in SCSI-2 and SCSI-3. Fast-20 (or
``Ultra'') is 20 mb/sec; Fast-40 (or "Ultra-2") is 40MB/sec.  The fast
options basically defines shorter timing parameters such as the
assertion period and hold time.</para>

<para>The parameters of the synchronous transfer are negotiated
between each target and initiator so different speed transfers
can occur over the same bus.</para>

</sect4>
<sect4><title>Path width</title>

<para>The standard SCSI data path is 8 bits wide.  The ``wide'' option
exploits a 16- or 32-bit data path (uses 68-pin rather than 50-pin
data cables).  You also get 4-bit rather than 3-bit device IDs, so you
can have up to 16 devices.  The wide option doubles or quadruples your
transfer rate, so for example a fast-20/wide SCSI link using 16 bits
transfers 40mb/sec.</para>

<para>What are those ``LUN'' numbers you see when you boot up? Think
of them as sub-addresses on the SCSI bus.  Most SCSI devices have only
one ``logical'' device inside them, thus they're LUN zero.  Some SCSI
devices can, however, present more than one separate logical unit to
the bus master, with different LUNs (0 through 7).  The only context
in which you'll normally use LUNs is with CD-ROM juke boxes.  Some
have been marketed that offer up to 7 CD-ROMS with one read
head. These use the LUN to differentiate which disk to select.</para>

<para>(There's history behind this.  Back in the days of EISA, drives were
supposed to be under the control of a separate SCSI controller, which
could handle up to 7 such devices (15 for wide SCSI).  These drives
were to be the Logical Units; hence the LUN, or Logical Unit Number.
Then, up to 7 of these SCSI controllers would be run by the controller
that we today consider the SCSI controller.  In practice, hardware
cost dropped so rapidly, and capability increased so rapidly, it
became more logical to embed the controller on the drive.)</para>

</sect4>
</sect3>
<sect3><title>Avoiding Pitfalls</title>

<para>Here are a couple of rules and heuristics to follow:</para>

<para>Rule 1: Total SCSI cable length (both external and internal devices) must
not exceed six meters.  For modern Ultra SCSI (with its higher speed)
cut that to three feet!</para>

<para>It's probably not a good idea to cable 20MB/s or faster SCSI devices
externally at all.  If you must, one of our informants advises using a
Granite Digital ``perfect impedance'' teflon cable (or equivalent);
these cables basically provide a near-perfect electrical environment
for a decent price, and can be ordered in custom configurations if
needed.</para>

<para>A common error is to forget the length of the ribbon cable used
for internal devices when adding external ones (that is, devices
chained to the SCSI board's external connector).</para>

<para>Rule 2: Both ends of the bus have to be electrically terminated. </para>

<para>On older devices this is done with removable resistor packs
&mdash; typically 8-pin-inline widgets, yellow or blue, that are
plugged into a plastic connector somewhere near the edge of the PCB
board on your device.  Peripherals commonly come with resistor packs
plugged in; you must <emphasis>remove</emphasis> the packs on all
devices except the two end ones in the physical chain.</para>

<para>Newer devices advertised as having "internal termination" have a
jumper or switch on the PCB board that enables termination.  These
devices are preferable, because the resistor packs are easy to lose or
damage.</para>

<para>Rule 3: No more than seven devices per chain (fifteen for Wide
SCSI).</para>

<para>There are eight SCSI IDs per controller.  The controller reserves ID 7
or 15, so your devices can use IDs 0 through 6 (or 0 through 14,
wide).  No two devices can share an ID; if this happens by accident,
neither will work.</para>

<para>The conventional ID assignments are: Primary hard disk = ID 0,
Secondary hard disk = ID 1, Tape = ID 2.  Some Unixes (notably SCO)
have these wired in.  You select a device's ID with jumpers on the PCB
or a thumbwheel.</para>

<para>SCSI IDs are completely independent of physical device chain
position.</para>

<para>Heuristic 1: If you're buying narrow SCSI, stick with controllers and
devices that use the Centronics-style 50-pin connector.  Internally these
connectors are physically identical to diskette cables.  Externally they
use a D50 shell.  This "standard" connector is common in the
desktop/tower/rackmount-PC world, but you'll find lots of funky DIN and
mini-DIN plugs on devices designed for Macintosh boxes and some laptops.
Ask in advance and don't get burned.</para>

<para>Heuristic 2: For now, when buying a controller, go with an Adaptec
xx42 or one of its clones such as the BusLogic 542.  (I like the
BusLogic 946 and 956, two particularly fast Adaptec clones
well-supported under Linux.)  The Adaptec is the card everybody
supports and the de-facto standard.  Occasional integration problems
have been reported with Unix under Future Domain and UltraStor cards,
apparently due to command-set incompatibilities.  At least, before you
buy these, make sure your OS explicitly supports them. </para>

<para>However: Beware the combination of an Adaptec 1542 with a PCI Mach32 
video card.  Older (1.1) Linux kernels handled it OK, but all current ones
choke.  Your editor had to replace his 1542 because of this, swearing
sulphurously the while. </para>

<para>Heuristic 3: You'll have fewer hassles if all your cables are made by
the same outfit.  (This is due to impedence reflections from minor
mismatches. You can get situations where cable A will work with B,
cable B will work with C, but A and C aren't happy together.  It's
also non-commutative.  The fact that `computer to A to B' works
doesn't mean that `computer to B to A' will work.</para>

<para id="sutton">Heuristic 4. Beware Cheap SCSI Cables!</para>

<para>Mark Sutton tells the following instructive horror story in a
note dated 5 Apr 1997: </para>

<para>I recently added an additional SCSI hard drive to my home
machine.  I bought an OEM packaged Quantum Fireball 2 gig SCSI drive
(meaning, I bought a drive in shrinkwrap, without so much as mounting
hardware or a manual.  Thank God for Quantum's web page or I would
have had no idea how to disable termination or set the SCSI ID on this
sucker.  Anyway, I digress...).  I stuck the drive in an external
mounting kit that I found in a pile of discarded computer parts at
work and my that boss said I could have.  (All 5 of my internal bays
were full of devices.)</para>

<para>Anyway, I had my drive, and my external SCSI mounting kit, I
needed a cable.</para>

<para>I went into my friendly local CompUSA in search of a SCSI cable,
and side-by-side, on two hooks, were two "identical" SCSI cables.
Both were 3 feet.  Both had Centronics to Centronics connectors, both
were made by the same manufacturer.  They had slightly different model
numbers.  One was $16.00, one was $30.00.  Of course, I bought the $16
cable.</para>

<para>Bad, I say, <emphasis>bad bad mistake</emphasis>.  I hooked this
sucker up like so: </para>

<screen>

                                     with scanner.
</screen>

<para>Shortly after booting, I found that data all over my old internal hard
drive was being hosed.  This was happening in DOS as well as in Linux.
Any disk access on either disk was hosing data on both disks, attempts
to scan were resulting in corrupted scans *and* hosing files on the
hard disks.  By the time I finished swapping cables around, and
checking terminations and settings, I had to restore both Linux and
DOS from backups. </para>

<para>I went back to CompUSA, exchanged the $16 cable for the $30 one, hooked
it up and had no more problems. </para>

<para>I carefully examined the cables and discovered that the $30 cable
contained 24 individual twisted pairs.  Each data line was twisted
with a ground line.  The $16 cable was 24 data wires with one overall
grounded shield.  Yet, both of these cables (from the same
<emphasis>manufacturer</emphasis>) were being sold as SCSI cables! </para>

<para>You get what you pay for. </para>

<para>(Another correspondent guesses that the cheap cable probably
said ``Macintosh'' on it.  The Mac connector is missing most of its
ground pins.)</para>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="disktrends"><title>Trends to Watch For</title>

<para>Disks of less than 10GB capacity simply aren't being manufactured
anymore; there's no margin in them.  Our spies tell us that all major disk
makers retooled their lines a while back to produce 9GB unit platters (IBM
is an exception; it seems to use 6GB platters), which are simply being
stacked 2N per spindle to produce ranges of drives with roughly 18GB
increments of capacity. </para>

<para>Average drive latency is inversely proportional to the disk's
rotational speed.  For years, most disks spun at 3600 rpm; most disks now
spin at 7,200 rpm, and high-end disks like the Seagate Cheetah line are
moving to 10,000 and 15,000 rpm. These fast-spin disks run extremely hot;
expect cooling to become a critical constraint in drive design.</para>

<para>Drive densities have reached the point at which standard inductive
read/write heads are a bottleneck.  In newer designs, expect to
see magnetoresistive head assemblies with separate read and write

He says the absolute best-quality drives are the Hewlett-Packards but
you will pay a hefty premium for that quality.</para>

<para>The other top-tier manufacturers are IBM, Quantum and Seagate; these
drives combine cutting-edge technology with very aggressive pricing.</para>

<para>The second tier consists of Maxtor, Conner, and Western Digital.</para>

<para>Maxtor often leads in capacity and speed, but at some cost in
other quality measures.  For example, many of the high-capacity Maxtor
drives have serious RFI emission problems which can cause high error
rates.  SCSI has built-in ECC correction, so SCSI drives only take a
performance hit from this; but it can lead to actual errors from IDE
drives.</para>

<para>Western Digital sells most of its output to Gateway at
sweetheart prices; WD drives are thus not widely available
elsewhere.</para>

<para>The third tier consists of Fujitsu, Toshiba, and everyone else.  My
friend observes that the Japanese, despite their reputation for process
engineering savvy, are notably poor at drive manufacturing; they've never spent
the money and engineering time needed to get really good at making the
media.</para>

<para>Just as a matter of interest, he also says that hard drives
typically start their life cycle at an OEM price around $400 each.
When the price erodes to around $180, the product gets turfed &mdash;
there's no margin any more. </para>

<sect2 id="iotune"><title>Tuning Your I/O Subsystem</title>

<para><emphasis>(This section comes to us courtesy of Perry The Cynic,
&lt;perry@sutr.cynic.org&gt;; it was written in 1998.  My own experience
agrees pretty completely with his. I have revised the numbers in it since
to reflect more recent developments.)</emphasis></para>

<para>Building a good I/O subsystem boils down to two major points:
<emphasis>pick matched components</emphasis> so you don't over-build any
piece without benefit, and <emphasis>construct the whole pipe such that
it can feed what your OS/application combo needs</emphasis>.</para>

<para>It's important to recognize that ``balance'' is with respect to not only
a particular processor/memory subsystem, but also to a particular OS
and application mix. A Unix server machine running the whole TCP/IP server
suite has radically different I/O requirements than a video-editing
workstation. For the ``big boys'' a good consultant will sample the I/O mix
(by reading existing system performance logs or taking new measurements)
and figure out how big the I/O system needs to be to satisfy that app
mix. This is not something your typical Linux buyer will want to do;
for one, the application mix is not static and will change over time. So what
you'll do instead is design an I/O subsystem that is internally
matched and provides maximum potential I/O performance for the money
you're willing to spend. Then you look at the price points and compare
them with those for the memory subsystem. That's the most important
trade-off inside the box.</para>

<para>So the job now is to design and buy an I/O subsystem that is well matched
to provide the best bang for your buck. The two major performance numbers
for disk I/O are latency and bandwidth. Latency is how long a program
has to wait to get a little piece of random data it asked for.
Bandwidth is how much contiguous data can be sent to/from the disk
once you've done the first piece. Latency is measured in milliseconds (ms);
bandwidth in megabytes per second (MB/s). Obviously, a third number of interest
is how big all of your disks are together (how much storage you've got),
in Gigabytes (GB).</para>

<para>Within a rather big envelope, minimizing latency is the cat's meow.
Every millisecond you shave off effective latency will make your system
feel significantly faster. Bandwidth, on the other hand, only helps you
if you suck a big chunk of contiguous data off the disk, which happens
rarely to most programs. You have to keep bandwidth in mind to avoid
mis-matching pieces, because (obviously) the lowest usable bandwidth in
a pipe constrains everything else.</para>

<para>I'm going to ignore IDE. IDE is no good for multi-processing systems,
period. You may use an IDE CD-ROM if you don't care about its
performance, but if you care about your I/O performance, go SCSI.</para>

<para>Let's look at the disks first. Whenever you seriously look at a
disk, <emphasis>get its data sheet</emphasis>. Every reputable
manufacturer has them on their website; just read off the product code
and follow the bouncing lights.  Beware of numbers (`&lt;12ms fast!')
you may see in ads; these folks often look for the lowest/highest
numbers on the data sheet and stick them into the ad copy. Not
dishonest (usually), but ignorant.</para>

<para>What you need to find out for a disk is:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>What kind of SCSI interface does it have? Look for
    "fast", "ultra", and "wide". Ignore disks that say "fiber"
    (this is a specialty physical layer not appropriate for the insides
    of small computers). Note that you'll often find the same disk with
    different interfaces.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>What is the "typical seek" time (ms)? Make sure
    you get "typical", not "track-to-track" or "maximum" or some other
    measure (these don't relate in obvious ways, due to things like
    head-settling time).</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>What is the rotational speed? This is typically
    4500, 5400, 7200, 10000, or 15000 rpm (rotations per minute). Also look
    for "rotational latency" (in ms). (In a pinch, average rotational
    latency is approx. 30000/rpm in milliseconds.)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>What is the `media transfer rate' or speed (in
    MB/s)? Many disks will have a range of numbers (say,
    7.2-10.8MB/s). Don't confuse this with the "interface transfer
    rate" which is always a round number (10 or 20 or 40MB/s) and is
    the speed of the SCSI bus itself.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>These numbers will let you do apple-with-apples comparisons of disks.
Beware that they will differ on different-size models of the same disk;
typically, bigger disks have slower seek times.</para>

<para>Now what does it all mean? Bandwidth first: the `media transfer rate'
is how much data you can, under ideal conditions, get off the disk per
second. This is a function mostly of rotation speed; the faster the
disk rotates, the more data passes under the heads per time unit. This
constrains the sustained bandwidth of <emphasis>this disk</emphasis>.</para>

<para>More interestingly, your effective latency is the sum of typical seek
time and rotational latency. So for a disk with 8.5ms seek time and 4ms
rotational latency, you can expect to spend about 12.5ms between the
moment the disk `wants' to read your data and the moment when it
actually starts reading it. This is the one number you are trying to
make small. Thus, you're looking for a disk with low seek times and
high rotation (RPM) rates.</para>

<para>For comparison purposes, the first hard drive I ever bought was a 20MB
drive with 65ms seek time and about 3000RPM rotation. A floppy drive
has about 100-200ms seek time. A CD-ROM drive can be anywhere between
120ms (fast) and 400ms (slow). The best IDE harddrives have about
10-12ms and 5400 rpm. The best SCSI harddrive I know (the Seagate
Cheetah) runs 7.8ms/10000rpm.</para>

<para>Fast, big drives are expensive. Really big drives are very
expensive. Really fast drives are pretty expensive. On the other end,
really slow, small drives are cheap but not cost effective, because it
doesn't cost any less to make the cases, ship the drives, and sell
them.</para>

<para>In between is a `sweet spot' where moving in either direction
(cheaper or more expensive) will cost you more than you get out of it. The
sweet spot moves (towards better value) with time. Right now (July 2001),
it's about at 18GB drives, 6ms, 10000rpm, ultra2 SCSI. If you can make the
effort, go to your local computer superstore and write down a dozen or so
drives they sell `naked'. (If they don't sell at least a dozen hard drives
naked, find yourself a better store. Use the Web, Luke!)  Plot cost against
size, seek and rotational speed, and it will usually become pretty obvious
which ones to get for your budget.</para>

<para>Do look for specials in stores; many superstores buy overstock from
manufacturers. If this is near the `sweet spot', it's often
surprisingly cheaper than comparable drives. Just make sure you
understand the warranty procedures.</para>

<para>Note that if you need a lot of capacity, you may be better off with
two (or more) drives than a single, bigger one. Not only can it be cheaper
but you end up with two separate head assemblies that move independently,
which can cut down on latency quite a bit (see below).</para>

<para>Once you've decided which kind of drive(s) you want, you must decide
how to distribute them over one or more SCSI buses. Yes, you
<emphasis>may</emphasis> want more than one SCSI bus. (My current desktop
machine has three.)  Essentially, the trick is to make sure that all the
disks on one bus, talking at the same time, don't exceed the capacity of
that bus.  At this time, I can't recommend anything but an Ultra/Wide SCSI
controller. This means that the attached SCSI bus can transfer data at up
to 40MB/s for an Ultra/Wide disk, 20MB/s for an Ultra/narrow disk, and
10MB/s for a `fast SCSI' disk. These numbers allow you do do your math: an
8MB/s disk will eat an entire bus on its own if it's `fast' (10MB/s). Three
6MB/s ultra/narrow disks fit onto one bus (3x6=18MB/s&lt;20MB/s), but just
barely. Two ultra/wide Cheetahs (12.8MB/s) will share an (ultra/wide) bus
(25.6&lt;40), but they would collide on an ultra/narrow bus, and any one
Cheetah would be bandwidth constrained on a (non-ultra) `fast' bus (12.8
&gt; 10).</para>

<para>If you find that you need two SCSI buses, you can go with `dual
channel' versions of many popular SCSI controller cards (including the
Adaptec). These are simply two controllers on one card (thus taking
only one PCI slot). This is cheaper and more compact than two cards;
however, on some motherboards with more than 3 PCI slots, using two
cards may be somewhat faster (ask me what a PCI bridge is :-).</para>

<para>How do you deal with slow SCSI devices - CD-ROMS, scanners, tape
drives, etc.?  If you stick these onto a SCSI bus with fast disks,
they will slow down things a bit. You can either accept that (as in ``I
hardly ever use my scanner anyway''), or stick them onto a separate
SCSI bus off a cheap controller card. Or you can (try to) get an ATA
version to stick onto that inevitable IDE interface on your
motherboard. The same logic applies to disks you won't normally use,
such as removables for data exchange.</para>

<para>If you find yourself at the high end of the bandwidth game, be aware
that the theoretical maximum of the PCI bus itself is 132MB/s. That
means that a dual ultra/wide SCSI controller (2x40MB/s) can fill more
than half of the PCI bus's bandwidth, and it is not advised to add
another fast controller to that mix. As it is, your device driver
better be well written, or your entire system will melt down (figuratively
speaking).</para>

<para>Incidentally, all of the numbers I used are `optimal' bandwidth
numbers. The real scoop is usually somewhere between 50-70% of nominal,
but things tend to cancel out - the drives don't quite transfer as fast
as they might, but the SCSI bus has overhead too, as does the
controller card.</para>

<para>Whether you have a single disk or multiple ones, on one or several
SCSI buses, you should give careful thought to their partition layout.
Given a set of disks and controllers, this is the most crucial
performance decision you'll make.</para>

<para>A partition is a contiguous group of sectors on the disk. Partitioning
typically starts at the outside and proceeds inwards. All partitions
on one disk share a single head assembly. That means that if you try
to overlap I/O on the first and last partition of a disk, the heads
must move full stroke back and forth over the disk, which can
radically increase seek time delays. A partition that is in the
middle of a partition stack is likely to have best seek performance,
since at worst the heads only have to move half-way to get there (and
they're likely to be around the area anyway).</para>

<para>Whenever possible, split partitions that compete onto different
disks. For example, /usr and the swap should be on different disks if
at all possible (unless you have outrageous amounts of RAM).</para>

<para>Another wrinkle is that most modern disks use `zone sectoring'. The
upshot is that outside partitions will have higher bandwidth than inner
ones (there is more data under the heads per revolution). So if you
need a work area for data streaming (say, a CD-R pre-image to record),
it should go on an outside (early numbered) partition of a
fast-rotating disk. Conversely, it's a good convention to put
rarely-used, performance-uncritical partitions on the inside (last).</para>

<para>Another notes concerns SCSI mode pages. Each (modern) SCSI disk has a
small part of its disk (or a dedicated EEPROM) reserved for persistent
configuration information. These parameters are called `mode pages',
for the mechanism (in the SCSI protocol) for accessing them. Mode page
parameters determine, among others, how the disk will write-cache, what
forms of error recovery it uses, how its RAM cache is organized, etc.
Very few configuration utilities allow access to mode page parameters
(I use FWB Toolkit on a Mac - it's simply the best tool I know for that
task), and the settings are usually factory preset for, uh, Windows 95
environments with marginal hardware and single-user operation.
Particularly the cache organization and disconnect/reconnect pages can
make a tremendous difference in actual performance. Unfortunately
there's really no easy lunch here - if you set mode page parameters
wrong, you can screw up your data in ways you won't notice until months
later, so this is definitely `no playing with the pushebuttons' territory.</para>

<para>Ah yes, caches. There are three major points where you could cache I/O
buffers: the OS, the SCSI controller, and the on-disk controller.
Intelligent OS caching is by far the biggest win, for many reasons. RAM
caches on SCSI controller cards are pretty pointless these days; you
shouldn't pay extra for them, and experiment with disabling them if
you're into tinkering.</para>

<para>RAM caches on the drives themselves are a mixed bag. At moderate size
(1-2MB), they are a potential big win for Windows 95/98, because
Windows has stupid VM and I/O drivers. If you run a true multi-tasking
OS like Linux, having unified RAM caches on the disk is a significant
loss, since the overlapping I/O threads kick each other out of the
cache, and the disk ends up performing work for nothing.</para>

<para>Most high-performance disks can be reconfigured (using mode page
parameters, see above) to have `segmented' caches (sort of like a
set-associative memory cache). With that configured properly, the RAM
caches can be a moderate win, not because caching is so great on the
disk (it's much better in the OS), but because it allows the disk
controller more flexibility to reschedule its I/O request queue. You
won't really notice it unless you routinely have &gt;2 I/O requests
pending at the SCSI level. The conventional wisdom (try it both ways)
applies.</para>

<para>And finally I <emphasis>do</emphasis> have to make a
disclaimer. Much of the stuff above is shameless simplification. In
reality, high-performance SCSI disks are very complicated
beasties. They run little mini-operating systems that are most
comfortable if they have 10-20 I/O requests pending <emphasis>at the
same time</emphasis>. Under those circumstances, the amortized global
latencies are much reduced, though any single request may experience
<emphasis>longer</emphasis> latencies than if it were the only one
pending. The only really valid analysis are stochastic-process models,
which we <emphasis>really</emphasis> don't want to get into
here. :-)</para>

<sect2 id="xtune"><title>Souping Up X Performance</title>

<para>If you care about X performance, be sure you get a graphics card
with a dedicated blitter and a high-speed local-bus connection.  If it
says "AGP" you have this; AGP is a cross-vendor standard for a local
bus optimized for graphics.</para>

<para>These cards speed up X in two ways.  First, they offload some
common screen-painting operations from the main processor onto
specialized processors on the card itself.  Secondly, by using a local
bus, they make it possible to send commands to the card faster than
the ISA bus could allow.  The combined effect can be eye-poppingly
fast screen updates even at very high resolutions.</para>

<para>There's no longer much reason to bother with any of the
closed-source X servers like MetroLink or X/Inside.  XFree86 now supports
most of the high-end cards that used to be the special preserve of the
closed-source X versions.</para>

<para>If you're feeling really flush, plump for a 17&quot; or even 20&quot;
monitor.  The larger size can make a major difference in viewing comfort.
Also you'll be set for 1600x1200, which many cards can support these days.
In the mean time, the bigger screen will allow you to use fonts in smaller
pixel sizes so that your text windows can be larger, giving you a
substantial part of the benefit you'd get from higher pixel
resolutions.</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="backups"><title>Hardware for Backups</title>

<para>You should have a tape drive for backup.  Ideally, your tape backup
should be able to image your entire disk.  Choosing a tape drive used to be
pretty complicated, with a plethora of different formats and media to chose
from.  It's much simpler now that the combination of cheap CD-ROM drives
and huge hard disks has effectively killed off QIC and other sub-megabyte
formats.  These advances have also killed off a bunch of niche technologies
for backup, including floptical disks, Bernoulli boxes, Iomega and SyQuest
removable drives, and magneto-optical drives -- though the latter have
survived as casual transfer media -- that is, as a sort of super-capable
floppy replacement)</para>

<para>Some people like to burn CDs for backup.  While this is a good way to
archive precious data, the capacity is too low and the media cost too high
for serious use.  Rewritable CD-RWs do make a very nice transfer medium,
however.</para>

<para>Digital Data Storage (DDS) capacities are a good match for today's
multi-gigabyte drives (this is essentially the same technology as
Digital Audio Tape or DAT).  I'm told that Hewlett-Packard DDS devices
are especially good, not surprising given HP's traditional obsession
with reliability and overengineering stuff.  All the DDSs I know about
are SCSI devices.</para>

<para>At the high end, 8mm helical-scan tape (the stuff used in Sony
camcorders) used to compete with DDS, but DDS drives have now outstripped
it in capacity and transfer speed.  A couple of other tape technologies
(notably DLT) still do, but their media are extremely expensive.</para>

<para>Here's a quick summary of the major alternative DDS formats:</para>

<para>DDS tape drives (and tapes) come actually in five variants: DDS,
DDS-DC, DDS-2, DDS-3, and DDS-4. These are supposed to be downward
compatible (e.g. DDS-2 reads/writes DDS-DC but not vice versa.) DDS and
DDS-DC use 60m and 90m tapes; the -DC version adds hardware
compression. DDS (non-DC) and DDS2 should be considered obsolete.</para>

<para>The DDS-3 and DDS-4 standards support higher density on the
tape. DDS-4 is bleeding edge (high premium), but DDS-3 is coming down now,
and can make the difference between single-tape and and multi-tape backups
(which can often make the difference between daily backups and "why didn't
I..." hand-wringing.)</para>

<para>Don't forget to put the cost of cleaning tapes into your budget. If a
DDS drive gets dirty heads (determined by the read-after-write error
rate), it will stop working until the heads are cleaned. DDS drives
typically start complaining after about 50 full-tape operations.</para>

<para>SCSI tapes and DDS3 and below normally have the "narrow" 50-pin
connector.  If your controller is "wide" (68 pins) you'll need a cable
adapter.  Better yet is to put a cheap SCSI controller like an AHA 154x in
the machine just for the tape -- otherwise you might end up plugging a tape
drive with a single-ended electrical interface into a controller with a
voltage-differential interface and dragging down the speed of every device
on the bus.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="mice"><title>Of Mice And Machines</title>

<para>Mice and trackballs used to be simple; now, thanks to Microsoft,
they're complicated.  Fortunately, XFree86 is now pretty good at
autodetecting your mouse when it starts up, so if that's what you're
using you can skip the next section.</para>

<sect2><title>Mouse Types</title>

<para>In the beginning, there was only the Mouse
Systems 3-button serial mouse; this reported status to a serial port
30 times a second using a 5-byte serial packet encoding now called
``C'' protocol.  The Logitech Series 7 and 9 mice were Mouse
Systems-compatible.  All Unixes that have any mouse support at all
understand C-protocol serial mice.</para>

<para>Then Microsoft got into the act.  They designed a two-button
serial mouse which reports only deltas in a three-byte packet; that
is, it sends changes in button status and motion reports only when the
mouse is actually moving.  This is called `M' protocol.  Microsoft
sold a lot of mice, so Logitech switched from `C' to `M' &mdash; but
they added a third button, state changes for which show up in an
optional fourth byte.  Thus, `M+' protocol, upward-compatible with
Microsoft's `M'.  Most Unix vendors add support for M+ mice, but it's
wise to check (Linux's XFree86 has it).</para>

<para>Bus mice are divided into 8255 and InPort types.  These report info
continuously at 30 or 60 Hz (though InPort mice have an option for
reporting deltas only), and you get interrupts on events and then have
to poll hardware ports for details.  Bus mice are no longer widely
available and there is no good reason to bother with them.</para>

<para>In addition to serial mice and bus mice, there are ``keyboard
mice''.  On PS/2s there are two identical-looking keyboard ports,
labeled (with icons) ``mouse'' & ``keyboard''.  Both are 6-pin
mini-DINs that look like the regular PC keyboard port only smaller.
Physically, the connector goes to the keyboard processor (often an
8042); electrically, it provides TTL levels (serial clock, serial
data, ground and +5V); logically, it uses the same protocol as normal
serial mice. The same keyboard processor that decodes the keyboard decodes
the mouse.  PS/2s have this port, many newer motherboards do
as well.  Confusingly, XFree86 thinks these keyboard mice are
bus mice.</para>

<para>All things considered, Unix users are probably best off going
with a serial mouse if their motherboard isn't one of the newer ones
with a built-in PS/2 mouse.  Most current clone motherboards give you
two serial ports, so you can still dedicate one to this and still have
one for the all-important modem.  Not only are the compatibility
issues less daunting, but a serial mouse loads the multitasking system
less due to interrupt frequency.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2><title>Buying a Mouse</title>

<para>Beware that most clone vendors, being DOS oriented, bundle
two-button M-type mice.  Thus, you may have to buy your own
three-button mouse.  Ignore the adspeak about dpi and pick a
mouse or trackball that feels good to your hand.</para>

<para>Your humble editor really, really likes the Logitech TrackMarble, an
optical trackball that eliminates the chronic roller-fouling problems of
the older TrackMan.  They're well-supported by XFree86 (type MouseMan), so
any Linux or BSD will accept them.</para>

</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="modems"><title>Modems</title>

<para>This section will give you a thumbnail sketch of the modem types
available out there, one tuned for the typical Unix installation's
needs.</para>

<sect2><title>The Simple Answer</title>

<para>The modem market has stabilized, with a clear leader at a reasonable
price.  If you can afford it ($270 in August 2001) go buy a U.S. Robotics
V.Everything external.  You can then know that you've got the best and
skip the rest of this section.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="modem_overview"><title>Overview of the Modem Market</title>

<para>The modem market is like consumer electronics (and unlike the
computer market as a whole) in that price is a very poor predictor of
performance.  For ordinary file transfers, some $50 modems are better than
some $150 modems.  Paying top dollar mainly buys you better tolerance of
poor connections and better performance at heavy-duty bi-directional
transfers (such as you would generate, for exmaple, using SLIP or PPP over
a leased line to an Internet provider).</para>

<para>In today's market, the typical modem does a nominal 56kbps -- V.90
plus V.29 or V.17 fax transmission and reception (over plain old phone
lines you won't get more than 53K of that).  You don't see much
in the way of slow/cheap to fast/expensive product ranges within a
single brand, because competition is fierce and for many modem board
designs (those featuring DSP (Digital Signal Processor) chips run by a
program in ROM) adding a new protocol is basically a software change.</para>

<para>For much more information on high-speed modems for Unix, see <ulink
url="http://www.o2.net/~gromitkc/winmodem.html">The Linux/Modem
Compatibility Knowledge Base</ulink>.  The page is aimed at Linux users,
but the advice is general to any non-Windows OS.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="modem_format"><title>Internal vs. External</title>

<para>Most modems come in two packagings: internal, designed to fit in
a PC card slot, and external, with its own case, power supply, and
front-panel lights.  Typically you'll pay $20 to $30 more for an
external modem than you will for the internal equivalent.  You'll also
need a serial port to connect your external modem to.</para>

<para>Pay that premium &mdash; being able to see the blinkenlights on
the external ones will help you understand and recover from
pathological situations.  For example, if your Unix system is prone to
``screaming-tty'' syndrome, you'll quickly learn to recognize the
pattern of flickers that goes with it.  Punch the hangup/reset button
on an external modem and you're done &mdash; whereas with an internal
modem, you have to go root and flounder around killing processes and
maybe cold-boot the machine just to reset the card.</para>

<para>See <ulink url="http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/faq/">Rick's
Rants</ulink> for extended discussion of this point.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="modem_pitfalls"><title>Pitfalls to Avoid</title>

<para>If the abbreviation ``RPI'' occurs anywhere on the box, don't even
consider buying the modem.  RPI (Rockwell Protocol Interface) is a
proprietary ``standard'' that allows modem makers to save a few bucks at
your expense by using a cheap-jack Rockwell chipset that doesn't do error
correction.  Instead, it hands the job off to a modem driver which (on
a Unix machine) you will not have.</para>

<para>Also avoid anything called a ``Windows Modem'' or ``WinModem'',
``HCF, or ``HSP''; these lobotomized pieces of crap require a Windows
DLL to run. They will eat up to 25% of your processor clocks during
transfers, and hog high-priority interrupts (causing your machine to
stall under Windows even if your processor still has spare
cycles). </para>

<para>Multi-user Unix eats enough processor clocks that you want to be
sure of good hardware buffering in your UART &mdash; that is, enough
of it to avoid losing characters between modem and PC if the OS is a
bit slow responding to an interrupt (V.42bis in hardware won't detect
this!).  This means you want a 16550A or equivalent UART.  If you're
using an external modem, this is an issue about your serial-port
board(s).  If you're using an internal modem, the UART is on the modem
card itself.  So, when buying internal modems,
<emphasis>ask</emphasis> what the UART type is.  If the vendor says
16540, lose them.</para>

<para>Many fax modems come with bundled MS-DOS fax software that is at
best useless under Unix, and at worst a software kluge to cover
inadequate hardware.  Avoid these bundles and buy a bare modem &mdash;
it's cheaper, and lowers the likelihood that something vital to your
communications needs has been left out of the hardware.</para>

<para>Avoid ``Class 1'' and ``Class 2'' modems.  Look for ``Class
2.0'' for the full EIA-standard command set.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2><title>What to Buy</title>

<para>What you want, these days, is a V.90 modem.  V.90, formally,
is the ITU-T recommendation for asymmetric data signalling
rates of up to 56Kbps in the direction of a digitally connected server
to a capable client, and up to 33.6Kbps in the direction of the client
to the server.</para>

<para>The technology is based on eliminating restrictions imposed by the
conversion of analog signals to digital form in the downstream data path
(server -> client). Data flow in the server to client direction does not
occur in the form of a modulated carrier, it is instead sent as binary
numbers representative of 256 possible voltage levels. The reason for the
asymmetrical send/receive rates is because in the direction from the client
to the server it is not possible to use a digital coding scheme and make it
work as well as V.34 does, thus V.34 is used instead.  It isn't possible
because the telco's line card has a codec that is a much better digital
level changer for the transmit direction than it is for the receive
direction. The codec used in the customer's modem is, in that respect,
somewhat more sophisticated and was designed to work as a fairly good level
changer in the receive direction (which the telco's codec was not designed
to do).</para>

<para>Note: Achievable bit rates are limited to less than 56kbps in
the United States by FCC regulations that limit power input to the
network.</para>

<para>Beyond the V series, the telcos are pushing a technology called ADSL
(Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line).  This method converts existing
twisted-pair telephone lines into access paths for multimedia and high
speed data communications. ADSL transmits more than 6Mbps to a
subscriber, and as much as 640 kbps more in both directions.</para>

<para>An ADSL circuit connects an ADSL modem on each end of a
twisted-pair phone line, creating three information channels; a high
speed downstream channel, a medium speed duplex channel, and a POTS
(Plain Old Telephone Service) channel. The POTS channel is split off
from the digital modem by filters, thus guaranteeing uninterrupted
POTS, even if ADSL fails. The high speed channel ranges from 1.5 to
6.1 Mbps, while duplex rates range from 16 to 640 kbps. Each channel
can be sub-multiplexed to form multiple, lower rate channels.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2><title>Fax Modems</title>

<para>Fax capability is included with most all modems these days; it's
cheap for manufacturers, being basically a pure software add-on.  The
CCITT also sets fax protocol standards.  Terms to know:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term> V.29</term>
<listitem><para> CCITT standard for Group III fax encoding at 9600bps</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term> V.17</term>
<listitem><para> CCITT standard for Group III fax encoding at
14400bps</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>V.17 isn't common yet, but it doesn't usually cost extra over
V.29 when you find it.</para>

<para>There's a separate series of standards for software control of fax
modems over the serial line maintained by the Electronics Industry
Association and friends. These are:</para>

<para><firstterm>Class 1</firstterm> &mdash; base EIA standard for fax
control as extensions to the Hayes AT command set.</para>

<para><firstterm>Class 2.0</firstterm> &mdash; enhanced EIA standard
including compression, error correction, station ID and other
features.</para>

<para><firstterm>Class 2</firstterm> &mdash; marketroidian for
anything between Class 1 and Class 2.0.  Different ``Class 2'' modems
implement different draft subsets of the 2.0 standard, so ``Class 2''
fax software won't necessarily drive any given ``Class 2''
modem.</para>

<para>There's also a proprietary Intel "standard" called CAS, Communicating
Applications Specification.  Ignore it; only Intel products support it.</para>

<para>The GNU toolset includes a freeware fax transmission and reception
toolset, Netfax.  Look for it at prep.ai.mit.edu:pub/gnu/fax-*.  It
says it requires a modem conforming to the ``Class 2'' control
standard, but you'd be safest getting a 2.0-conformant modem for
reasons explained above.  Netfax also requires GNU Ghostscript to do
Postscript handling for it.</para>

<sect1 id="multimedia"><title>CD-ROMs and Multimedia Hardware</title>

<sect2 id=cdrom><title>CD-ROM Drives</title>

<para>Standard CD-ROMs hold about 650 megabytes of read-only data in a
format called ISO-9660 (formerly ``High Sierra'').  All current Unixes
now support these devices.  In fact, most Unix and Linux software is
now distributed on ISO-9660 CD-ROM, a cheaper and better method than
the QIC tapes we used to use.</para>

<para>CD-ROM drives may be driven through SCSI, through enhanced IDE
(ATAPI), or through a proprietary interface card (like the Mitsumi and
Sony interfaces). Unix support for CD-ROMs is usually through SCSI
drivers (exception: BSDI/386 supports the Mitsumi interface; Linux
supports the Mitsumi and Sony interfaces).  I recommend that you avoid
the proprietary cards; they will effectively cost you money when you
need to upgrade.  Besides, street prices for SCSI CD-ROMS have
dropped below $200.</para>

<para>(A few external CD-ROMs come with a parallel-port interface.
Avoid these; they tend to have very slow transfer rates.)</para>

<para>Any CD-ROM you buy should be at least a ``double-spin'' drive
meeting the MPC2 (Multimedia PC) standard of a 300K/sec transfer rate
when reading.  digital data. The older single-speed drives, which only
supported the 150K/sec rate Red Book standard for audio CDs, are
obsolete.  The lowest speed you can buy these days is 4X (600K/sec).
6X, 8X, 10X, 12X, 24X, 32X, 40X, and 56X are available.</para>

<para>The next level up in CD hardware standards is CD-ROM XA.  So
far, drives that support XA are few and expensive.  It's not yet in
wide use in the DOS/Windows world, and I don't know of any Unix
support for it, either in closed- or open-source code.</para>

<para>CD-ROM access times about 280ms for high-end double-speed drives (to
put this in perspective, it's about 30 times slower than a typical 9ms hard
disk, but considerably faster than a tape).  Accordingly, modern 32X
drives are about half the speed of a hard drive. </para>

<para>Most CD-ROMS will include a headphone jack so you can play audio
CDs on them.  Better-quality ones will also include two RCA jacks for
use with speakers.  Another feature to look for is a drive door or
seal that protects the drive head from dust.</para>

<para>CD-ROM formats are still an area of some confusion.  A slight
enhancement of the original ``High Sierra'' CD-ROM filesystem format
(designed for use with DOS, and limited to DOS's 8+3 file-naming
convention) has been standardized as ISO-9660.</para>

<para>There is a de-facto Unix standard called `Rock Ridge' pioneered by the
Sun User's Group shareware CD-ROMs.  This is a way of putting an extra
layer of indirection on an ISO-9660 layout that preserves Unix's long
dual-case filenames.  Some Unixes (notably Linux, netBSD, freeBSD and
BSD/OS) can mount Rock Ridge filesystems.</para>

<para>More much more detail on CD-ROMs, CD-ROM standards and how to
buy drives is available in the alt.cdrom FAQ, available for FTP as <ulink
url="ftp://cdrom.com/cdrom/faq">cdrom.com:/cdrom/faq</ulink>.  It is also
archived in the news.answers tree at rtfm.  This FAQ includes
comparison tables tables of numerous drive types, CD-ROM sources, and

</sect2>
<sect2 id=sound><title>Sound Cards and Speakers</title>

<para>Look for the following features as a minimum in your sound card:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>16-bit sampling (for 65536 dynamic levels rather
	than 256).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Mono and stereo support.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Full-duplex mode.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Sampling rates ranging fron 8K/sec (voice-quality)
	through 11KHz (AM-radio quality), 22KHz (FM-radio quality) and
	standard audio (44.1KHz).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>MIDI interface via a standard 15-pin D-shell 
	connector.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>RCA output jacks for headphones or speakers.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>A microphone jack for sound input.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The most important feature is your sound card is what type of MIDI
synthesis it has.  All current sound cards have some sort of MIDI (musical
instrument digital interface) compliance, but if nothing else, make
sure your card supports the General MIDI standard. MIDI is just a set
of commands issued by the application that tells the sound card which
instrument to play, at what note, and for what duration.</para>

<para>Older and cheaper cards use FM synthesis. This synthesis uses a
combination of sine waves to imitate the sounds of the different
instruments. The result is like the sound tracks of most computer
games sold a few years ago; imitation music with an arcade-like
sound.</para>

<para>The method used by most modern sound boards is called wave table
synthesis. In this method, digitized samples of actual instrument
sounds are used as templates for the tones generated by the MIDI
commands.  Wave table cards vary in the quantity and quality of
samples; one figure of merit often quoted is the wave table ROM size
(often 4MB or 8MB).  Also some boards have wavetable RAM that can
store samples loaded from a disk.</para>

<para>Soundcards with DSP (Digital Signal Processing) can perform synthesis
effects on board, relieving the CPU for other tasks.  Some DSP chips
are even software-programmable. Some high-end cards even include 3D
sound effects. Whether the system used is SRS (Sound Retrieval
System), Q-Sound, or Spatializer, it is designed to improve the
perceived stereo effect of your speakers.  These 3D effects work by
delaying the timing of certain portions of the audio signal so that
different frequencies hit your ear at slightly different times. The
downside is that some of the cards equipped with 3D sound add a
noticeable amount of noise to the card's output.</para>

<para>If you play a lot of computer games, you'll need to pay attention to
compatibility. DOS games are written almost exclusively for the
Creative Labs specification; you will need a card that is 100% Sound
Blaster compatible.  Many vendors do not license the Creative Labs
specification but claim that their cards are 100% game
compatible. This means that the sound will work, but not all sounds
that you hear will be the ones that the game programmers intended. If
you play many DOS games, it would be best to buy a Sound Blaster and
save yourself a migraine.</para>

<para>Lastly, try to avoid sound cards with built-in amplifiers that are
more powerful than 4 watts/channel. Sound cards that have more
powerful amplifiers are said to have the problem of adding noise to the
card's output. Use powered speakers with a 4 watt/channel card to
solve this problem. Most cards are equipped with 4 watts/channel
anyway. Wavetable cards are so inexpensive these days that it's almost
worth their additional cost over a regular FM synthesis card. If you
decide to settle for an FM card, make sure that there is a
daughterboard made for the card that will let you upgrade to wavetable
synthesis. In some cases, however, the wavetable card is cheaper than
buying an FM card and then deciding that you want the wavetable
upgrade. If you do decide on the wavetable as your card of choice, PC
Magazine rated the best MIDI wavetables (MIDI being the most important
feature in my opinion) the Media Vision Premium 3-D, Media Vision Pro
3-D, Creative Labs Sound Blaster AWE32, and the Turtle Beach Monterey
(although there are value editions of the Sound Blaster 32 that have
fewer ROM instrument samples but maintain the superior MIDI wavetable
synthesis).</para>

<para>Linux, includes drivers for the SoundBlaster series and many
other boards including the PAS Adlib, the Gravis Ultrasound, and the
ProAudioSpectrum.  Many of these are included in the 2.0 and newer
kernels.  See the <ulink
url="http://www.4front-tech.com/ossfree/index.html">OSS/Free home
page</ulink> for details</para>

<para>Warning: some sound cards require a specific CD-ROM type!  Avoid
these.</para>

<para>In speakers, look for a magnetically-shielded enclosure with volume,
bass and treble controls.  Some speakers run off the card's 4-watt
signal; others are ``self-powered'', using batteries or a separate
power supply.  Your major buying choice is which one of these options
to pursue.</para>

<para>Generally speaking, you'll get better value if you buy your
sound card, CD-ROM, and speakers not separately but as a bundled
``multimedia upgrade kit'' (even though Unix users will usually have
to throw out the bundled software).</para>

<para>One final, important tip: that audio cable from your CD-ROM back
to the sound card is used only when you play audio CD-ROMs through
your speakers.  Software-generated sound goes through the system bus,
so you can play ``Doom'' with sound even if your sound board won't
accept the audio cable connector.</para>

<sect1 id="laptops"><title>Special considerations when buying laptops</title>

<para>Up until about 1999 the laptop market was completely crazy.  The
technology was in a state of violent flux, with ``standards'' phasing
in and out and prices dropping like rocks.  Things are beginning to
settle out a bit more now.</para>

<para>One sign of this change is that there are now a couple of laptop lines
that are clear best-of-breeds for reasons having as much to do with 
good industrial design and ergonomics as the technical details of the
processor and display.</para>

<para>In lightweight machines, I'm a big fan of the Sony VAIO line.
I owned one from early 1999 until it physically disintegrated under
the rigors of travel in late 2000, and could hardly imagine
switching.  They weigh 3.5 pounds, give you an honest 3 hours of life
per detachable battery pack, have a very nice 1024x768 display, and
are just plain <emphasis>pretty</emphasis>. Their only serious
drawback is that they're not rugged, and often fall apart after
a year or so of use.</para>

<para>If you want a full-power laptop that can compete with or replace
your desktop machine, the IBM ThinkPad line is the bomb.  Capable,
rugged, and nicely designed (though somewhat heavyweight for my
taste).  I now use a ThinkPad X20, the lightest and smallest machine
in the line, and like it a lot.</para>

<para>These machines are not cheap, though.  If you're trying to save
money by buying a no-name laptop, here are things to look for:</para>

<para>First: despite what you may believe, the most important aspect
of any laptop is <emphasis>not</emphasis> the CPU, or the disk, or the
memory, or the screen, or the battery capacity.  It's the keyboard
feel, since unlike in a PC, you cannot throw the keyboard away and
replace it with another one unless you replace the whole computer.
<emphasis>Never buy any laptop that you have not typed on for a couple
hours</emphasis>.  Trying a keyboard for a few minutes is not enough.
Keyboards have very subtle properties that can still affect whether
they mess up your wrists.</para>

<para>A standard desktop keyboard has keycaps 19mm across with 7.55mm
between them.  If you plot frequency of typing errors against keycap
size, it turns out there's a sharp knee in the curve at 17.8
millimeters.  Beware of ``kneetop'' and ``palmtop'' machines, which
squeeze the keycaps a lot tighter and typically don't have enough
oomph for Unix anyway; you're best off with the "notebook" class
machines that have full-sized keys.</para>

<para>Second: be careful that your laptop meets the minimum core and disk
requirements for the Unix you want to run.  This is generally not a problem
with desktop machines, which can be upgraded cheaply and easily, but laptops
often have more stringent constraints.</para>

<para>Third: with present flatscreens, 1024x768 color is the best you're
going to do (though that may change soon).  If you want more than that
(for X, for example) you have to either fall back to a desktop or make
sure there's an external-monitor port on the laptop (and many laptops
won't support higher resolution than the flatscreen's).</para>

<para>Fourth: look for Nickel-Metal-Hydride (NiMH) batteries, as
opposed to the older (Nickel-Cadmium) NiCad type.  NiMH batteries are
great because they have considerably higher energy capacity per pound
that NiCads.  They need special circuitry to charge them fast, so
don't try to throw out your NiCads and replace them with NiMH cells if
you use a fast charger intended for NiCads.  Both kinds of cells can
be damaged by overcharging at rates faster than 10 hours per full
charge.</para>

<para>Fifth: Older laptop electronics were 5-volt CMOS.  Most current
designs are 3.3-volt CMOS with power-management features on the processor
(these are often labelled APM, Advanced Power Management).  Buy this, if
you can, to nearly double your use time between recharges.</para>

<para>Sixth: about those vendor-supplied time-between-recharge
figures; <emphasis>don't believe them</emphasis>.  They collect those
from a totally quiescent machine, sometimes with the screen or hard
disk turned off.  Under DOS, you'd be lucky to get half the endurance
they quote; under Unix, which hits the disk more often, it may be less
yet.  Figures from magazine reviews are more reliable.</para>

<para>Seventh: You probably want a color dual-scan display.  It used
to be that you had to choose between passive-matrix LCD (cheap,
miserable color) and active- matrix LCD (great color, horribly
expensive).  Dual-scan passive-matrix is nearly as good as
active-matrix, except for the narrower viewing angle, and it's much
cheaper.  Avoid the older single-scan models, sometimes marketed as
having STN (super-twisted nematic) displays.</para>

<para>Eighth: get either a CD-ROM drive or an Ethernet card.
Otherwise initial load of your Unix could turn into a serious
problem...</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="howtobuy"><title>How to Buy</title>

<sect2 id="whentobuy"><title>When to Buy</title>

<para>It used to be that good configurations for Unix were what the market
called `server' machines, with beefed-up I/O subsystems and fast
buses.  No longer; today's `servers' are monster boxes with multiple
power supplies and processors, gigabytes of memory, and
industrial-grade air cooling -- they're not really suitable as
personal machines. A typical SCSI desktop workstation is as much as
you'll need.</para>

<para>Prices keep dropping, so there's a temptation to wait forever to
buy.  A good way to cope with this is to configure your system on paper, get
a couple of initial estimates, then set a trigger price, below the
lowest one, at what you're willing to pay.  Then watch and wait.  When
the configuration cost hits your trigger price, place your order.</para>

<para>The advantage of this method is that it requires you to settle in your
mind, well in advance, what you're willing to pay for what you're
getting.  That way, you'll buy at the earliest time you should, and
won't stress too much out afterwards as it depreciates.</para>

<para>Before you shop, do your homework.  Publications like "Computer
Shopper" (and their web site at <ulink
url="http://www.computershopper.com">
http://www.computershopper.com</ulink>) are invaluable for helping you
get a feel for prices and what clonemakers are doing.  Another
excellent site is <ulink
url="http://www.computeresp.com">ComputerESP</ulink>.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="wheretobuy"><title>Where to Buy</title>

<para>The most important where-to-buy advice is negative.  Do
<emphasis>not</emphasis> go to a traditional, business-oriented
storefront dealership.  Their overheads are high.  So are their
prices.</para>

<para>Especially, run -- do not walk -- away from any outfit that trumpets
`business solutions'.  This is marketing code for the kind of place that
will justify a heavy price premium by promising after-sale service and
training which, nine times out of ten, will turn out to be nonexistent or
incompetent.  Sure, they'll give you plush carpeting and a firm handshake
from a guy with too many teeth and an expensive watch -- but did you really
want to pay for that?</para>

<para>There are two major alternatives to storefront dealerships and one
minor one.  The major ones are mail order and computer superstores.
The minor one is computer fairs.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="fairs"><title>Computer Fairs</title>

<para>I used to be a big fan of hole-in-the-wall stores run by immigrants
from the other side of the International Date Line, but most of those
places have been driven out of the regular retail game by the
superstores.  The only place you find diaspora Chinese and Indians
selling cheap PCs over the counter anymore is at computer fairs.
(Usually they're doing it to publicize a mail-order business.)</para>

<para>You can find good `loss-leader' deals on individual parts at these
fairs (they're especially good places to buy disk drives cheap). But I
call them a minor alternative because it's hard to get a custom
SCSI-based configuration tuned for Unix built for you at a fair.  So
you end up, effectively, back in the mail-order or Web channel.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="mailorder"><title>Mail Order</title>

<para>Direct-mail or Web buying makes a lot of sense today for anyone with
more technical savvy than J. Random Luser in a suit.  Even from
no-name mail-order houses, parts and system quality tend to be high
and consistent, so conventional dealerships don't really have much
more to offer than a warm fuzzy feeling.  Furthermore, competition has
become so intense that even mail-order vendors today have to offer not
just lower prices than ever before but warranty and support policies
of a depth that would have seemed incredible a few years back.  For
example, many bundle a year of on-site hardware support with their
medium- and high-end "business" configurations for a very low premium
over the bare hardware.</para>

<para>Note, however, that assembling a system yourself out of
mail-order parts is <emphasis>not</emphasis> likely to save you money
over dealing with the mail-order systems houses.  You can't buy parts
at the volume they do; the discounts they command are bigger than the
premiums reflected in their prices.  The lack of any system warranty
or support can also be a problem even if you're expert enough to do
the integration yourself &mdash; because you also assume all the risk
of defective parts and integration problems.</para>

<para>Cruise through `Computer Shopper' and similar monthly ad compendia.
Even if you decide to go with a conventional dealer, this will tell you
what <emphasis>their</emphasis> premiums look like.  These days most
mail-order outfits with enough cash to advertise on glossy paper are good
risks.</para>

<para>Watch out for dealers (Spectrum Trading for one) who charge ridiculous
shipping fees. One of our spies reports he bought a hotswappable hard
disc drive tray that weighed about 3 lbs. and cost $250 and they
charged $25 to ship it UPS groud.</para>

<para>Don't forget that (most places) you can avoid sales tax by buying from an
out-of-state mail-order outfit, and save yourself 6-8% depending on where you
live.  If you live near a state line, buying from a local outfit you can often
win, quite legally, by having the stuff shipped to a friend or relative just
over it.  Best of all is a buddy with a state-registered dealer number; these
aren't very hard to get and confer not just exemption from sales tax but
(often) whopping discounts from the vendors.  Hand him a dollar afterwards to
make it legal.</para>

<para>(Note: I have been advised that you shouldn't try the latter tactic in
Florida -- they are notoriously tough on "resale license" holders).</para>

<para>(Note II: The Supreme Court has ruled that states may not tax
out-of-state businesses under existing law, but left the way open for
Congress to pass enabling legislation.  Let's hope the mail-order
industry has good lobbyists.)</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="superstores"><title>Computer Superstores</title>

<para>Big chain superstores like CompUSA and Circuit City give you a
reasonable alternative to mail order.  And there are good reasons to
explore it -- these stores buy and sell at volumes that allow them to
offer prices not far above mail-order.  (They make back a lot of
their margin on computer games and small accessories like mouse pads,
cables, and floppy disks.)</para>

<para>One thing you should not buy mail-order if you can avoid it is a
monitor.  Monitors are subject to substantial quality variations even
within the same make and model.  Also, one good bump during shipping
can twist the yoke on a monitor so the image is tilted with respect to
the bezel.  So buy your monitor face-to-face, picking the best out of
three or four.</para>

<para>Another good argument for buying at a superstore is that you may
have to pay return postage if you ship a mail-order system back.  On a
big, heavy system, this can eat your initial price savings.</para>

<para>The only major problem with superstores is that the salespeople who
staff them aren't very bright or very clueful (it's a sort of Darwinian
reverse-selection effect; these are the guys who are fascinated by computer
technology but not smart enough to be techies).  Most of them don't know
from Linux and are likely to push things like two-button mice and (worse!)
controllerless modems, that you can't use.  Use caution and check your
system manifest.</para>

<para>But if you shop carefully and don't fall for one of their
name-brand "prestige" systems, you can get prices comparable to mail
order with the comfort of knowing there's a trouble desk you can drive
back to in a pinch.  (Also, you <emphasis>can</emphasis> see your
monitor before you buy!)</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="buying_tips"><title>Other Buying Tips</title>

<para>You can often get out of paying tax just by paying cash,
especially at computer shows.  You can always say you're going to ship
the equipment out of the state.</para>

<para>A lot of vendors bundle DOS or Windows and variable amounts of apps
with their hardware.  If you tell them to lose all this useless cruft
they may shave $50 or $100 off the system price.</para>

<sect1 id="questions"><title>Questions You Should Always Ask Your Vendor</title>

<sect2 id=warranty><title>Minimum Warranty Provisions</title>

<para>The weakest guarantee you should settle for in the mail-order
market should include:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>72-hour burn-in to avoid that sudden infant death
syndrome.  (Also, try to find out if they do a power-cycling test and
how many repeats they do; this stresses the hardware much more than
steady burn-in.)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>30 day money-back guarantee.  Watch out for fine print
that weakens this with a restocking fee or limits it with
exclusions.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>1 year parts and labor guarantee (some vendors give 2
years).</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>1 year of 800 number tech support (many vendors give
lifetime support).</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Additionally, many vendors offer a year of on-site service free.
You should find out who they contract the service to.  Also be sure
the free service coverage area includes your site; some unscrupulous
vendors weasel their way out with "some locations pay extra", which
translates roughly to "through the nose if you're further away than
our parking lot".</para>

<para>If you're buying store-front, find out what they'll guarantee beyond the
above.  If the answer is "nothing", go somewhere else.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="documention"><title>Documentation</title>

<para>Ask your potential suppliers what kind and volume of documentation
they supply with your hardware.  You should get, at minimum,
operations manuals for the motherboard and each card or peripheral;
also an IRQ list.  Skimpiness in this area is a valuable clue that
they may be using no-name parts from Upper Baluchistan, which is not
necessarily a red flag in itself but should prompt you to ask more
questions.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="quality"><title>A System Quality Checklist</title>

<para>There are various cost-cutting tactics a vendor can use which
bring down the system's overall quality.  Here are some good questions
to ask:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<sect2 id="tricks"><title>Tricks and Traps in Mail-Order Warranties</title>

<para>Reading mail-order warranties is an art in itself.  A few tips:</para>

<para>Beware the deadly modifier ``manufacturer's'' on a warranty;
this means you have to go back to the equipment's original
manufacturer in case of problems and can't get satisfaction from the
mail-order house.  Also, manufacturer's warranties run from the date
<emphasis>they</emphasis> ship; by the time the mail-order house
assembles and ships your system, it may have run out!</para>

<para>Watch for the equally deadly ``We do not guarantee
compatibility''.  This gotcha on a component vendor's ad means you may
not be able to return, say, a video card that fails to work with your
motherboard.</para>

<para>Another dangerous phrase is ``We reserve the right to substitute
equivalent items''.  This means that instead of getting the
high-quality name-brand parts advertised in the configuration you just
ordered, you may get those no-name parts from Upper Baluchistan
&mdash; theoretically equivalent according to the spec sheets, but
perhaps more likely to die the day after the warranty expires.
Substitution can be interpreted as ``bait and switch'', so most
vendors are scared of getting called on this.  Very few will hold
their position if you press the matter.</para>

<para>Another red flag: ``Only warranted in supported environments''.
This may mean they won't honor a warranty on a non-DOS system at all,
or it may mean they'll insist on installing the Unix on disk
themselves.</para>

<para>One absolute show-stopper is the phrase ``All sales are final''.
This means you have <emphasis>no</emphasis> options if a part doesn't
work.  Avoid any company with this policy.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="mail_questions"><title>Special Questions to Ask Mail-Order Vendors Before Buying</title>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Does the vendor have the part or system presently in
stock?  Mail order companies tend to run with very lean inventories;
if they don't have your item in stock, delivery may take longer.
Possibly <emphasis>much</emphasis> longer.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Does the vendor pay for shipping?  What's the delivery
wait?</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If you need to return your system, is there a
restocking fee? and will the vendor cover the return freight?  Knowing
the restocking fee can be particularly important, as they make keep
you from getting real satisfaction on a bad major part.  Avoid dealing
with anyone who quotes more than a 15% restocking fee &mdash; and it's
a good idea, if possible, to avoid any dealer who charges a restocking
fee at all.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Warranties are tricky.  There are companies whose warranties are
invalidated by opening the case.  Some of those companies sell
upgradeable systems, but only authorized service centers can do
upgrades without invalidating the warranty.  Sometimes a system is
purchased with the warranty already invalidated.  There are vendors
who buy minimal systems and upgrade them with cheap RAM and/or disk
drives.  If the vendor is not an authorized service center, the
manufacturer's warranty is invalidated.  The only recourse in case of
a problem is the vendor's warranty.  So beware!</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id=payment><title>Payment Method</title>

<para>It's a good idea to pay with AmEx or Visa or MasterCard; that
way you can stop payment if you get a lemon, and may benefit from a
buyer-protection plan using the credit card company's clout (not all
cards offer buyer-protection plans, and some that do have restrictions
which may be applicable).  However, watch for phrases like ``Credit
card surcharges apply'' or ``All prices reflect 3% cash discount''
which mean you're going to get socked extra if you pay by card.</para>

<para>Note that many credit-card companies have clauses in their
standard contracts forbidding such surcharges.  You can (and should)
report such practices to your credit-card issuer.  If you already paid
the surcharge, they will usually see to it that it is returned to you.
Credit-card companies will often stop dealing with businesses that
repeat such behavior.</para>

<sect2 id="vendors"><title>Which Clone Vendors to Talk To</title>

<sect3 id="pans"><title>Some pans</title>

<para><emphasis>Dell</emphasis>: treated the Unix community, customers
and its own employees very badly back in 1994 by making an internal
decision to kill its market-leading SVr4 port, then obfuscating and
lying about its intentions for months after its actions made the
direction clear.  On the other hand, they started getting serious
about Linux in early 2000.  I won't say boycott them the way I used
to, but I will say you ought to think other vendors instead.</para>

<para><emphasis>Gateway</emphasis>: may also be a vendor to avoid.
Apparently their newer machines don't have parity bits in their
memories; memory is tested only on reboot.  This is dubious design
even for DOS, and totally unacceptable for Unix.</para>

<para>The hardware business that VA Linux Systems used to run is, alas, no
more.  <emphasis>Requiesciat in pace.</emphasis> They made damn good stuff 
(and yes, I thought so long before they made me a director of the
corporation).</para>

<para>In early August 2001 I designed an `Ultimate Linux Box' with Gary
Sandine and John Pearson of <ulink url="http://lanm-pc.com">Los Alamos

<sect1 id="upgrading"><title>Upgrading Older Machines</title>

<sect2 id="oldmem"><title>Older Memory Types</title>

<para>The last-generation memory package was a SIMM (Single In-Line
Memory Module).  We include some information on these here for people
upgrading old systems.</para>

<para>SIMMs have 9 bits wide (8 bits of data, one for parity) and
either 1, 4, or 16 megabytes in size. The 16s are slightly cheaper per
megabyte.</para>

<para>There are two physical SIMM sizes; 30-pin and 72-pin.  The 30-pin size
is long obsolete; most SIMM-using motherboards have exclusively 72-pin
sockets.</para>

<para>Also, your memory may or may not have on-board parity check bits.
Memory with parity is specified as ``x36'' (4 check bits per word);
memory without is ``x32''.  Some motherboards require parity memory;
some (including those based on the Neptune chipset) can use parity if
present; some (including those based on the Triton chipset) cannot use
it.  Parity memory is a good idea for Unix machines, which stress the
hardware more than other OSs.</para>

<para>You'll hear a lot about ``EDO'' (Extended Data Out) RAM.  This stuff is
5%-10% more expensive, but that pays for a significant performance
boost in ``burst mode'' (that is, when fetching large contiguous
sections of memory into the cache).  Most current motherboards
(including those based on the Triton chipset) can use
EDO but don't require it.</para>

<para>You do <emphasis>not</emphasis> want to buy 1MB SIMMs any more,
unless you're filling out memory in an existing system configured with
1MB SIMMs.  The trouble with these (besides the fact that four of them
are more expensive than a 4MB chip) is that, due to interleaving
constraints, you'll probably have to throw them away if you ever add
more memory.</para>

<para>These interleaving constraints differ from motherboard to
motherboard.  Typically, memory sockets are set up in banks of either
2 or 4, with a requirement that you fill all sockets of each bank with
the same size of chip.  Also, if you mix chip sizes in the banks, the
sizes have to decrease smoothly (so there won't be gaps in the memory
address space).</para>

<para>So your possible configurations look like the following table.
All of these are possible on 4-bank, 16-slot boards; only the
asterisked ones are possible on 2-bank, 8-slot boards.  All the
capacities above 64MB require that the board accept 16MB SIMMs.  All
current 2x8 boards accept these.</para>

<para>As you can see from the table, most configurations with 1MB chips

<para>Here's some more about memory packaging.</para>

        Dual Inline Pack.  These are the little 16-, 18- or more legged

	memory.</para></listitem>

        Single Inline Memory Module.  A small 30-pin card composed of
        several chips (the number differs by manufacturer, age, and
        density) and support components (mostly older modules) that
        installs in a snap-in socket.  They evolved through 128K,
        256K, and 512K modules--all sadly obsolete today--into 1Mb,

<varlistentry>
<term> 72-pin SIMM</term>
<listitem><para>
        Introduced in the last couple of years to cut down on the number
        modules needed, they usually run 4Mb, 8Mb, 16Mb, and 32Mb.  Many
        motherboards are available with both 30 and 72-pin SIMM sockets
        to allow migration use of your older SIMMs.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<listitem><para>
	Dual In-Line Memory Module.  This is the current cutting edge,

</variablelist>

<para>There are also adapter cards that will accept 30-pin SIMM
modules and plug into a 72-pin socket; make sure you've the room for
these if you intend to try them, as they protrude quite a bit above
the board.  There are also companies that will, for modest fees,
desolder the memory chips from 30-pin SIMMs and wave solder them onto
72-pin boards. </para>
