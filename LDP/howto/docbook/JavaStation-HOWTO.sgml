<Para>
Pete got me going with <Application>Linux</Application> on the 
<ProductName>JavaStation</ProductName> in December 1998, has 
been the main kernel programmer adding in support for the 
<ProductName>JavaStation</ProductName> line, and despite his busy 
work schedule was nice enough to find time to answer all my email 
queries for help over the last 15 months. 
</Para>

<Para>
Eric worked on bringing <Application>X</Application> support to the 
<ProductName>JavaStation</ProductName> when it had none.
He had been working on a dedicated server for the <ProductName>
JavaStation</ProductName> in early 1999, and kept me informed of 
his progress.  In mid-1999, he switched tactics and sent a working 
framebuffer example to test out.  He also wrote the first comprehensive 
mini-HOWTO for the <ProductName>JavaStations</ProductName>, 
answered my email questions, and got me interested in the embedded
solution which I employ here at Marquette.

<Para>
The <ProductName>JavaStation</ProductName> <Acronym>NC</Acronym> is a 
model line of network computers built and sold by 
<ULink url="http://www.sun.com">Sun Microsystems</Ulink> between 
November 1996 and March 2000.  The <ProductName>JavaStation</ProductName> 
line was Sun's low-cost terminal option during that timeframe. 
</Para>
 
<Para>
The <ProductName>JavaStation</ProductName> hardware ran Sun's 
own <Application>JavaOS</Application> and either Sun's <Application>
Hotjava</Application> web browser, Sun's <Application>HotJava Views
</Application> task-manager software, or custom <Application>Java
</Application> applications of the customer's choice. 
</Para>
 
<Para>
The <ProductName>JavaStation</ProductName> was originally billed in 
November 1996 sneak previews as a low-cost desktop terminal, 
providing customers access to hot new <Application>Java</Application> 
applications, <Quote>legacy</Quote> <Application>X</Application> applications, 
and <Quote>legacy</Quote> <Application>MS Windows</Application> apps.  
During its lifetime, The <ProductName>JavaStation</ProductName>'s marketed 
functionality was changed twice from <Quote>desktop terminal</Quote> to 
<Quote>single-app desktop device</Quote> to finally a <Quote>browser-based 
kiosk device</Quote>.
</Para>
 
<Para>
At no time did Sun market the <ProductName>JavaStation</ProductName> as

<Title>Definition of an <Acronym>NC</Acronym> including the Differentiation 
from <Acronym>PC</Acronym>'s</Title>

<Para>
A network computer, or <Acronym>NC</Acronym>, was hailed as 
"the next big thing" in computing from late 1995 to early 1998.  
Conventional <Acronym>PC</Acronym>'s, called "fat clients", were 
expected to be minimized in businesses by thin-client 
<Acronym>NC</Acronym>'s. 
</Para>
 
<Para>
Thin-clients get their <Acronym>OS</Acronym>, applications, and data 
files entirely through the network.  They are different from 
dumb-terminals;  they run full-scale graphical applications.  
Thin-clients are also different than graphical X-terminals.  
X-terminals typically run an X server and display the client programs of 
a remote server.  Thin clients generally run full-scale graphical 
programs locally, such as a web browser, a <Application>Java</Application> 
application, or a <Quote>legacy-connectivity program</Quote>, which enables 
the thin-client to display <Application>X</Application> apps or 
<Application>MS Windows</Application> apps which run on more
powerful servers. 
</Para>
 
<Para>
Advantages of <Acronym>NC</Acronym>'s include:

<Title>Description of the <ProductName>JavaStation</ProductName> Model 
Line including Hardware Specs</Title>

<Para>
Depending on who you talk to, the number of <ProductName>JavaStation
</ProductName> models that were created is anywhere from one to six.  
The descriptions below will explain why. 
</Para>
 

<Sect3 id="MrCoffeeDescSection">

<Title>
<ProductName>JavaStation-1</ProductName> [ <Quote>Mr. Coffee</Quote>] 
[<Quote>the brick</Quote>] [Sun Option No. JJ-xx]
</Title>
 
<Para>
This model is the most prevalent <ProductName>JavaStation</ProductName> model 
you are likely to find, although it wasn't the one and only 
<Emphasis><ProductName>JavaStation</ProductName></Emphasis> model Sun wished 
to sell to the public.  The <ProductName>JavaStation-1</ProductName> was the 
first generation <ProductName>JavaStation</ProductName>, released in 
November 1996 to pilot deployments as Sun's <Quote>proof of concept</Quote> 
of the Java <Acronym>NC</Acronym> design.  
</Para>
 
<Para>
Hardware-wise, the <ProductName>JavaStation-1</ProductName> is a 
Sun4M architecture machine.  It is based on the <ProductName>SPARCStation-4
</ProductName> design, with some deletions and <Acronym>PC</Acronym>-like 
modifications.  It is powered by a <Hardware>100 Mhz MicroSPARC IIe 
CPU</Hardware> and has no <Hardware>SCSI</Hardware>, <Hardware>internal disks
</Hardware>, <Hardware>floppy</Hardware>, <Hardware>CD</Hardware> or 
<Hardware>expansion slots</Hardware>.  The <ProductName>Mr. Coffee
</ProductName> <Hardware>motherboard</Hardware> is Sun Part 
No. <ProductNumber>501-3141</ProductNumber>. 
</Para>
 
<Para>
Instead of using the Sun-type <Hardware>keyboard</Hardware> and 
<Hardware>mice</Hardware>, <ProductName>JavaStation-1</ProductName> 
uses <Acronym>PC</Acronym>-like <Hardware>PS2</Hardware> parts instead.  
One of the original marketing highlights of the <ProductName>JavaStation
</ProductName> was that it would use standard <Acronym>PC</Acronym> parts 
wherever possible to keep overall price down. 
</Para>
 
<Para>
The <Quote>brick</Quote> has four <Hardware>PC-like SIMM</Hardware> 
slots.  The <Hardware>SIMMs</Hardware> taken are industry-standard 
60ns, 32-bit, 72-pin, 5V fast page <Hardware>SIMMs</Hardware>, 
installed in pairs.  Each slot is capable of holding up to a 
<Hardware>16MB SIMM</Hardware>, bringing the maximum total capacity 
of the unit to 64MB.  The <Quote>xx</Quote> in the Sun Option# of the 
unit indicated how much memory the unit shipped with.
</Para>
 
<Para>
For video display, the <ProductName>JavaStation-1</ProductName> utilizes 
the <Hardware>Sun TCX framebuffer</Hardware>, capable of 1024x768@70Hz in 
8-bit color.  The port connector however, is a <Hardware>standard VGA jack
</Hardware>, enabling the user to use standard <Acronym>PC</Acronym> 
<Hardware>monitors</Hardware> if desired (again, low cost in mind).  
The <Hardware>on-board audio</Hardware> is a <Hardware>Crystal CS4231 chip
</Hardware>, and the network interface is the <Hardware>Sun Lance</Hardware> 
10Mbps interface.  In addition, the <Quote>brick</Quote> also came with 
a <Hardware>9-pin serial port</Hardware> and <Hardware>1/8" audio out jack
</Hardware> on its back.  
</Para>
 
<Para>
The <ProductName>JavaStation-1</ProductName> was fitted into the Sun 
<Quote>unidisk</Quote> form factor case, and has been seen in a number 
of color schemes.  <ProductName>JavaStations</ProductName> have been 
fitted with casings in the white with light blue trim scheme used in 
<Hardware>Sun workstations</Hardware>, as well as the dark blue-grey 
<Quote>new desktop</Quote> scheme.  Some say <Quote>JavaStation</Quote>
and have the Java coffee cup logo written on it, others do not.  
Collectors may wish to collect all case variations.
</Para>
 
<Para>
The <ProductName>JavaStation-1</ProductName> was used in early 
Sun demos, and sold to pilot sites.  When first brought out, the 
cost to pilot sites was $699US.   This was at a time when <Acronym>PC
</Acronym>'s were still higher than $1000US.  By the end of the pilot
run, Sun was selling any remaining or used units for $299-$399US, in
anticipation for its <Quote>real</Quote> <ProductName>JavaStation
</ProductName> model.

<ProductName>Krups</ProductName></Quote>] [<Quote><ProductName>the tower</ProductName></Quote>]
[<Quote><ProductName>the percolator</ProductName></Quote>] [
Sun Option No. JK-xx]
</Title>
 
<Para>
This model is the second most prevalent <ProductName>JavaStation</ProductName> 
model you are likely to find.  When you talk to industry folks about the 
<Quote>JavaStation</Quote>, this is typically the model remembered first.  
Delayed numerous times, the <ProductName>Krups</ProductName> model 
officially went on sale to the general public Mar. 26, 1998 at the annual 
JavaOne conference. 
</Para>
 
<Para>
Though generation two of the <ProductName>JavaStation</ProductName> line, the 
<ProductName>Krups</ProductName> model was <Emphasis>the JavaStation</Emphasis>
.  Sporting a completely different board design than <ProductName>JavaStation-1
</ProductName>, <ProductName>Krups</ProductName> establishes what was to be 
the characteristic <ProductName>JavaStation</ProductName> architecture. 
</Para>
 
<Para>
<ProductName>Krups</ProductName> is powered by a 
<Hardware>110Mhz MicroSPARC IIep</Hardware> chip, (note the 'p'). 
Its mainboard had the internal addition of a <Hardware>PCI bus</Hardware>, 
about a year before this standard bus made its well-publicized 
appearance on the <ProductName>Sun Ultra</ProductName> workstation 
line. The <ProductName>Krups</ProductName> <Hardware>motherboard</Hardware> 
is Sun Part no. <ProductNumber>501-4267</ProductNumber>.
</Para>
 
<Para>
<ProductName>Krups</ProductName> keeps the <Hardware>PS2 keyboard</Hardware> 
and <Hardware>PS2 mouse ports</Hardware> from <ProductName>JavaStation-1
</ProductName>, keeping in mind the low-cost, interoperable goal of 
generation 1. 
</Para>
 
<Para>
With the new board design, came new memory chip sockets.  Instead of
<Hardware>SIMMs</Hardware>, the <Quote>tower</Quote> moved to <Hardware>
168-pin DIMMs</Hardware>.  <Hardware>DIMMs</Hardware> had begun to make 
their way from the workstation realm to <Acronym>PC</Acronym>'s in the 
time between generations one and two of the <ProductName>JavaStation
</ProductName> line, so it was fitting for Sun to switch to
it in anticipation of their status low-cost commodity memory chips. The
<Hardware>DIMMs</Hardware> accepted by the <Quote>tower</Quote> are 
<Hardware>168pin, 3.3V unbuffered DIMMs</Hardware>.  With two sockets 
capable of holding a <Hardware>32MB DIMM</Hardware> each, the 
<ProductName>Krups</ProductName> has a maximum capacity of 64<Acronym>MB
</Acronym> <Acronym>RAM</Acronym>. As with the <ProductName>JavaStation-1
</ProductName>, the number <Quote>xx</Quote> in the Sun option number 
refers to the amount of memory shipped with the unit. 
</Para>
 
<Para>
For video display, the <ProductName>JavaStation-NC</ProductName> utilizes 
the <Hardware>PCI-based IGS C1682 framebuffer</Hardware>, 
capable of 1280x1024@80Hz in 24-bit <Quote>true color</Quote>.  This 
is a step up from the 8-bit display on <ProductName>JavaStation-1
</ProductName>.  The port connector remained a <Hardware>standard VGA jack
</Hardware> like <ProductName>JavaStation-1</ProductName>, enabling the 
user to use standard <Acronym>PC</Acronym> monitors if desired.
The on-board audio remains a <Hardware>Crystal 
CS4231 chip</Hardware> like <ProductName>JavaStation-1</ProductName>. 
The network interface on <ProductName>Krups</ProductName> is the 
<Hardware>Sun HappyMeal</Hardware> 10/100 Mbps interface, another step 
up from the original offering of <ProductName>JavaStation-1</ProductName>.
</Para>
 
<Para>
The <Quote>tower</Quote> came with the <Hardware>9-pin serial port
</Hardware> and <Hardware>1/8" audio out jack</Hardware> as 
<ProductName>JavaStation-1</ProductName>, but it also added a 
<Hardware>1/8" audio-in jack</Hardware>, to do sound recording with. 
</Para>
 
<Para>
Another addition in the <ProductName>JavaStation-NC</ProductName> is a

Perhaps the thing most memorable about the <ProductName>JavaStation-NC
</ProductName> is its case design.  The <ProductName>Krups</ProductName> 
comes in an aesthetically appealing casing.  The <Hardware>mainboard</Hardware> 
is mounted vertically, and the shell entraps it, giving it the <Quote>tower
</Quote> or <Quote>percolator</Quote> shape referred to.  With the 
streamlined case, the <Hardware>power supply</Hardware> is moved outside 
to small transformer.  The <ProductName>Krups</ProductName> unit gives 
off so little heat that there are no onboard cooling fans, making the 
<ProductName>Krups</ProductName> a <Emphasis>dead-silent</Emphasis> 
machine.  Imagine the difference in noise when replacing a lab of 
traditional desktops with the <ProductName>Krups</ProductName>!  
This case design earned <ProductName>Krups</ProductName> a<Quote>

The <ProductName>Krups</ProductName> had an initial base price of $599US,

<Para>
This model is extremely rare to find.  It was never available for

The Generation 3 <Quote>Super JavaStation</Quote>

<Para>
Sun originally envisioned three generation models of the <ProductName>

<ProductName>Krups</ProductName>, and the <Quote>Super JavaStation</Quote>.   
Generation Three was billed in early literature as going to be the fastest

<Hardware>CPU</Hardware> and a <Hardware>JavaChip co-processor</Hardware> 
to translate <Application>Java-bytecode</Application> in hardware.

<Para>
All indications are that it never got beyond the mental stage,
and was more of a marketing myth than anything else. 
</Para>

<Para>
First, consider that the cost of higher performance <Acronym>CPU</Acronym> 
as a factor.  If Sun packaged a high-performance <Acronym>CPU</Acronym> into 
a <ProductName>JavaStation</ProductName>, the low-cost advantage of an 
<Acronym>NC</Acronym> goes away.

<Para>
Next, Sun did have their <Hardware>PicoJava chip</Hardware> available to 
decode <Application>Java bytecode</Application>, but word is the performance 
was not as good as expected, and the <Hardware>JavaChip</Hardware> project 
was shelved in the Summer of 1998, not long after <ProductName>Krups

the <ProductName>JavaStations</ProductName> with <Application>Linux

Well, of course the old JavaStations were practically
unusable.  It's not a matter of just my opinion; we used to
have CU 310 full of students using the Xterms all the time.
As soon as the JavaStations appeared there were NO STUDENTS
in there at all.  The JavaStations killed CU 310.  Now that
the JavaStations are (thanks to you) back up to speed,
students are beginning to come back, but they've gotten out
of the habit of working in our lab, and are used to working
on their own in the dorms.  I think this is a big loss --
they don't learn anything from talking to each other in the
labs anymore.

Ghostview was slow, etc, but even vi was too slow.  I am
used to typing quickly, and when the cursor can't keep up
with me, I can't handle it.  I would also have worked at home
if I didn't have to be here.  And there were those annoying
red squares left all over the Xterm window when you were in
vi.  I had to type ^L every few lines to get rid of them to
see what I was typing...  The pits.  The whole setup made
me lose a lot of respect for Sun (although I try to separate
the different product lines as much as possible);  I also
think Sun will not get respect for hyping a product like the
JavaStation so strongly, and then just dumping it.  I would
wonder why anyone would not just dump Sun...

BTW, the JavaStations, now that they are fast, are quite fine.

I believe that it was the triple combination of Sun's JavaOS, the 
Hotjava software, and GraphOn's GoJoe X-connectivity software which 
ultimately doomed the JavaStation line. 
</Para>
 
<Para>
JavaOS was always sluggish in performance for us.  It was rated as
having one of the slowest Java VMs by a ZDNet Online Magazane review at
<ULink url="http://www.zdnet.com/pcmag/features/javaguide/jfgr10.htm">
http://www.zdnet.com/pcmag/features/javaguide/hfgr10.htm</ULink>
.  I speculate this was the the main cause of delaying the 
JavaStation's formal public release to April 1998.   
</Para>

<Para>
JavaOS also always lagged behind the current Java developer 
spec (ie running Java 1.0 when Java 1.1 was prevalent, and Java 1.1 
when Java 1.2 was issued).  It was tough explaining to students why
the books they were buying were all using the new event-model of Java 1.1,
but they could not program to it and have it run on <Quote>the Java machine
</Quote>.  There were also some implementation problems with some of the 
AWT peers which sometimes made programming across
platforms difficult.
</Para>

<Para>
These performance and implementation problems were never addressed in 
subsequent build of JavaOS for the duration we ran it.  I believe the 
last edition we had used a Java 1.1.4 runtime, when we had a Java 1.2
development kit on the server.
</Para>

<Para>
The HotJava browser software suffered from not being able to handle 
web standards HTML4, cascading style-sheets, or the ECMA javascript.
All of these standards were employed in commercial sites at the time, 
resulting in many sites that weren't viewable by the JavaStations.  
The Hotjava Browser engine also had serious printing problems with 
certain webpages, some of which appeared on Sun's own website!
</Para>

<Para>
The HotJava Views task selector software also was rough.  Users could have
multiple apps running, but only one displayed at a time.  Manipulation 
of multiple window panes was difficult (no minimization, no quick list to
all apps, resizing not always possible).  Flexibility users had grown
accustomed to was tossed out in favor of this task-selector approach.
On Sun's Java website there was a page boasting of a committee formed
that decided this was the <Quote>right way</Quote> to make a desktop.
Tell that to our users.
</Para>
 
<Para>
The GraphOn Go-Joe software was by far the most damaging piece of software
to the JavaStation line.  This was an X-connectivity software Sun licensed
from GraphOn to give users access to the Solaris servers' X apps.  
The connectivity worked via a daemon installed on the Solaris server, 
which was connected to by a Java connectivity applet on the NC side.  This 
small applet (only about 250K) simply threw up the latest display state 
and sent back to the daemon the mouse and keyboard strokes of the user.  
Unlike Xterminals though, the actual Xserver process was spawned and 
communicated with on the remote server-side by the daemon.  Communication 
between the GraphOn client applet and the server daemon was supposedly 
done by a patented protocol to compress communication and speed things up.
However, the performance of X under Go-Joe was terribly sluggish, with 
horrible refresh rates (10-seconds for some page scroll refreshes).  
Many sites operators I spoke to elected to not run the Go-Joe software 
past a trial period for this reason.  We had to run it though, as our 
users were heavily X dependant.  Alternatives like Weird/X were not 
available at this time, and VNC proved not up to snuff given the slow 
JavaOS VM.
</Para>

<Para>
This performance in Go-Joe alone was enough to give uninformed users the
impression that the JavaStation was an underpowered machine, especially 
when placed side-by-side with the low-cost, end-of-lifed Sun Xterminal 1 
hardware it was meant to replace.  Our students left labs in droves, 
faculty were upset, and giving demos to outsiders was downright 
embarrassing.  In reality the hardware was solid and stable, but 
was hampered by this new, untested OS and new, untested applications 
running on a new, untested hardware architecture.   This triple-threat 
combination, and Sun's timeline for fixing the problems is what 
I feel truly doomed the JavaStation.
</Para>
 
<Para>
I remember that in 1998, Sun publicized that it had rolled out 3000 
of these machines in-house, including one on Scott McNealy's desk.  
One who has used the JavaStations with the Sun software would have 
to wonder whether he ever turned it on and used it solely for a day?  
Had he done so, I'm sure he'd demand things be done differently.  
Why Sun never ported and released its tried and tested XTerminal 
software to the JavaStation, or even a mini-Solaris, remained a 
mystery to us the whole time before we switched to Linux.  It was
only after we moved to Linux and the JavaStation line was formally killed
by Sun when we learned from some inside Sun sources that Solaris 
actually was ported to Mr. Coffee, but released only internally at Sun.  
As a heavily invested customer site who had begged for help, this was 
not only disheartening, but insulting to discover.
</Para>
 
<Para>
Lastly, the customer support we received at the time was horrible.  We pled
our case on more than a few occassions, but requests always seemed to
fall on deaf ears.  Calling up SunSolve for JavaStation help always
resulted in a transfer to a Java <Emphasis>Language</Emphasis> engineer.  
If the Sun employees do not know their own products, that's a problem!
</Para>

<Para>
>From our view, there no doubt was politics involved in this, and as
customers, we were the ones to bear the results of this.
We continue using Sun equipment when it comes to the proven models 
like the Enterprise-class servers and diskarrays, but on the 
latest low-cost desktop offerings, we will be forever cautious 
given the JavaStation history.
</Para>

<Para>
Linux now proves the JavaStations are adequate machines, and Sun could 
take this bait and go with it.  If they sell the JavaStations for $250 
a piece and the JavaStation running a proven OS like Linux (or Solaris) 
with proven apps (X), the JavaStation makes for a great network appliance.  
The recent NetPliance I-Opener Linux hack and subsequent controversy 
proves there certainly is a market for this type of low-cost device.

This document will describe how to set up serving the network <Application>

from a Sun server running <Application>SparcLinux</Application>.  While you 
do not need a Sun server to serve your <Application>Linux</Application> 
image off of, the <Hardware>Sun SparcLinux server</Hardware> is needed 
should you wish to compile a kernel of your own, or prototype a new 
filesystem for your <ProductName>JavaStations</ProductName> to use.  
Otherwise, you will need to use prepackaged kernels and filesystems 
somebody else has pre-built and made publicly available for use. 
</Para>
 
<Para>
Your network can be a simple <Hardware>10 Mbps ethernet</Hardware> 
<Acronym>LAN</Acronym>, but when you begin using more than 50 
<ProductName>JavaStations</ProductName> at once, a <Hardware>switched 
100 Mbps network</Hardware> becomes desirable for your server to handle 
multiple concurrent boot requests. 
</Para>
 
<Para>
This HOWTO includes example kernels and filesystems for you to use, 
eliminating your need of a <Hardware>Linux/SPARC server</Hardware>,

<Para>
I reported this problem to Sun in November 1999, at which time I was

<Quote>unsupported configuration.</Quote>.   Never mind the client 
was a piece of hardware made by Sun itself.  Also never mind that 
indirect <Acronym>XDMCP</Acronym> queries is a standard itself which 
was broken by Sun.  A call back in late January 2000, and I learn that
the record of my previous call was non-existant, but a fix was now on 
its way. The fix finally was made available in April 2000, five months
after first reporting the problem.  Considering revisions to this 
patch during the broken <Acronym>XDMCP</Acronym> period dealt with 
fixing system security issues, we were forced to run the older insecure 
software for five months while waiting for a fix to a problem which 
should have been patched immediately.

<ProductName>JavaStation</ProductName></Title>

<Para>
Enabling <Application>X</Application> on the <ProductName>JavaStation
</ProductName> is possible.  
</Para>

<Para>
First, be sure you have enabled the appropriate framebuffer device
in your kernel's configuration (as described elsewhere in this document).
</Para>

<Para>
Next, you'll want to use the generic <Application>Sun Framebuffer X server
</Application> and <Quote>XF86Config</Quote> file.  You can build this 
yourself, or you can try someone's prebuilt binaries, like the samples
pointed to below.
</Para>

<Para>
As of this time, <Application>XFree 4.0</Application> does not work on 
the <Hardware>SPARC</Hardware> line.  You'll need to use an 
<Application>XFree 3.3.x</Application> variant in the meantime.  
The new driver model of 4.0 will provide the path necessary to
provide a dedicated accellerated X server for the <ProductName>
JavaStations</ProductName>.

<Title>Is There Mailing List Help?</Title>

<Para>
There is a mailing devoted exclusively to running <Application>Linux
</Application> on <Hardware>SPARC processor</Hardware> based machines 
like the <ProductName>JavaStations</ProductName>.
</Para>

<Para>
The mailing list address is <Quote>sparclinux@vger.rutgers.edu</Quote>. 
You should first subscribe to it by sending a message to 
<Quote>majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu</Quote> with a subject and body line 
of <Quote>subscribe sparclinux &lt;your_email_address&gt;</Quote>.  You 
can leave out your email address, but it is helpful to put it in if you

<Para>
Pete Zaitcev <Email>zaitcev@metabyte.com</Email> was the driving force 
in programming the <Application>Linux kernel</Application> support for 
the <ProductName>JavaStation</ProductName> line.  He maintains a 
website of low-level hardware details at
