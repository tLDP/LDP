      This miniHOWTO is about how to install the OpenGL drivers for
      Nvidia graphics cards on Linux.  In addition to just installing the
      Nvidia drivers, this mini-HOWTO also explains how to install XFree86, the
      OpenGL Utility library (part of Mesa), the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (glut),
      the full set of OpenGL manpages, and Qt and its OpenGL extension so
      that a user can have a complete runtime and development environment
      for OpenGL applications on Linux.

	<title>Download the software packages</title>

	<para>
	First of all, the OpenGL drivers for the Nvidia cards currently require
	a system with Linux kernel 2.2.12 or later.  If you don't have it, then
	you will have to upgrade your system's Linux kernel and that is the topic
	of other HOWTOs!  But nevertheless, the first step would be do download
	a new kernel at:
	</para>

	<para>
    <ulink url="http://www.kernel.org/">http://www.kernel.org/</ulink>
	</para>

	<para>
	XFree86 4.0 or later, preferably 4.01 as of this writing, is also required.
	Its installation will be covered later.
	</para>

	<para>
	Software packages.
	</para>

	<para>
	XFree86 4.0.1.
	</para>

	<para>
	XFree86 comes in three files:
	<itemizedlist>

	<listitem><para>X401src-2.tgz</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>X401src-3.tgz</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>doctools-1.2.tgz</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	</para>

	<para>
	Doctools is something it uses to prepare the X documentation.
	</para>

	<para>
    <ulink url="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/">ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/</ulink>
	</para>

	<para>
	Includes glX, the OpenGL X interface functions.
	Each window system (MS Windows, X etc) has to provide the
	platform-specific interfaces between OpenGL and the window system
	to provide for mapping a GL rendering context to a window system
	window.
	</para>

	<para>
	OpenGL man pages.
	</para>

	<para>
	XFree86 comes with only the glX man pages.  If you want a full set of
	OpenGL man pages, you have to get them yourself.

	</para>

	<para>
	These man pages are in a format ready to be unpacked into the
	XFree86 source distributions, see below.
	</para>

	<para>
	Mesa 3.3.
	</para>

	<para>
	MesaLib-3.3.tar.gz

	<para>
    <ulink url="http://mesa3d.sourceforge.net/">http://mesa3d.sourceforge.net/</ulink>
    </para>

	<para>
	Provides libGLU (GL Utility).  GLU is a library built on top of OpenGL
	to provide some higher level functions for applications.  OpenGL
	itself, libGL.so, is considered a low-level library.  Many apps make
	use of higher level libs like GLU to get work done.
	</para>

	<para>
	The main reason to install Mesa when you already have XFree86 4, is to get
	libGLU.  GLU is a standard part of most OpenGL installations and is expected
	to be present by lots of programs.
	</para>

	<para>
	GLUT
	</para>

	<para>
	glut-3.7.tar.gz
	glut_data-3.7.tar.gz
	</para>

	<para>
    <ulink url="http://reality.sgi.com/mjk/glut3/">http://reality.sgi.com/mjk/glut3/</ulink>
	</para>

	<para>
	Glut provides a window system independent interface between OpenGL
	and any supported window system.  For instance, on the X Window System, it
	hides the details of using glX functions to setup a window.  Programmers
	can write code once and can compile it to work on MS Windows or X, etc
	provided that a GLUT library is available on the target platform.
	</para>

	<para>
	Like GLU above, GLUT is a standard part of most OpenGL installations.
	Many example programs and even some applications, make use of libglut.
	For instance, The OpenGL Programming Guide (red book) makes	use of Glut
	for its example programs.
	</para>

	<para>
	You need to install GLU and GLUT if you want to be able to compile
	many of the programs that are freely downloadable as source code.
	Some programs may even need them to run if they were linked to them
	dynamically.
	</para>


	<para>
	Qt
	</para>

	<para>
	qt-x11-2.1.0.tar.gz or later version
	</para>

	<para>
    <ulink url="http://www.troll.no/">http://www.troll.no/</ulink>
	</para>

	<para>
	Qt is a cross-platform GUI library that makes it easy to create X applications
	with standard GUI elements (widgets) like menubars, scollbars, dropdown lists,
	checkboxes, buttons, multiple document interface, and many other GUI things.
	Using Qt, a program can be compiled for both MS Windows and X without
	changing any code.  Its a very popular GUI library and is used to create
	the core libraries of KDE (<ulink url="http://www.kde.org/">http://www.kde.org/</ulink>).
	</para>

	<para>
	Qt has an extension (qt/ententions/opengl) for OpenGL that provides for
	creating OpenGL rendering contexts in Qt windows.  This provides some
	alternative to both GLUT and using the glX functions directly plus the
	added benefit of full access to the excellent qt widgets and
	cross-platform portability.
	</para>

	<para>
	This is useful if you want to compile or develop programs based on Qt.
	</para>

	<para>
	NVIDIA drivers.
	</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>NVIDIA_kernel-0.9-4.tar.gz</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>NVIDIA_GLX-0.9-4.xfree401.tar.gz</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>
	As of this writing, version 0.9-5 is also available for XFree86 4.01
	if you want to try them.
	</para>

	<para>
	<ulink url="http://www.nvidia.com/">http://www.nvidia.com/</ulink>
	</para>

	<para>
	These make a kernel driver: /lib/modules/2.2.16/video/NVdriver
	and libGL.so and libGLcore.so files that go into /usr/lib/ to replace
	and Mesa ones that might be in there. libGL.so is OpenGL.  These files
	are nvidia's own hardware accelerated OpenGL implementation.
	</para>

	<para>
	XFree86 4.0.1 appears to contain the core of Mesa 3.3, however, it is missing
	the libGLU* files which many programs want.
	</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="instx">
	<title>Install XFree86</title>

	<para>
	If you have a version of XFree86 installed already, you may want to move it
	or delete it:
	<screen>

		cd /usr
		mv X11R6 X11R6-old
		cd /etc
		mv X11 X11-old
	</screen>
	</para>

	<para>
	If these locations are not correct for your distribution of Linux, you will
	have to look around your filesystem a bit - try looking in /var
	</para>

	<para>
	<screen>

	cd /usr/src
	mkdir release
	cd release
	tar -xvzf X401src-1.tgz
	tar -xvzf X401src-2.tgz
	tar -xvzf X401src-3.tgz
	tar -xvzf doctools-1.2.tar.gz

	-- unpack the man pages (actually, glx pages are already present)
	tar -xvzf mangl.tar.Z
	tar -xvzf manglx.tar.Z
	tar -xvzf manglu.tar.Z
	</screen>
	</para>

	<para>
	A file has to be edited to allow these man pages to compile/install with
	the rest of the distribution:
	<screen>

	cd xc/doc/man/GL
	Edit the file: Imakefile
		SUBDIRS = glx gl glu
	</screen>
	</para>

	<para>
	When you unpacked the man*.tar.Z files above, two new directories
	where added: gl glu
	</para>

	<para>
	<screen>

	cd /usr/src/release
	cd doctools-1.2
	make
	make install
	cd ..
	cd xc
	make World
	-- before installing, make sure you have moved or deleted prior installation of X
	make install
	make install.man
	</screen>
	</para>

	<para>
	When X is up and running (later), try using the xman program to see that the gl,glx,glu
	and glut man pages are in section 3.
	</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="instmesa">
	<title>Install Mesa</title>

	<para>
	Note: This gives you the libGLU* files that are missing in XFree86.
	To completely uninstall any Mesa libs that may have come with Slackware:
	<screen>

		removepkg mesa
	</screen>
	Procedures vary for other distributions.  If there is no clear way to
	uninstall an existing Mesa, then at least confirm where it is installed:
	normally either under /usr or /usr/local.  The example below assumes that
	Mesa is installed (or going to get installed) under /usr.  Installing
	over an old version is probably harmless.  Look for /usr/lib/libMesa*
	or /usr/local/lib/libMesa*
	</para>

	<para>
	<screen>

	-- unpack the Glut-3.7 packages ...
	-- Mesa's compile looks for it
	cd /usr/src
	tar -xvzf glut-3.7.tar.gz
	tar -xvzf glut_data-3.7.tar.gz

	cd /usr/src
	tar -xvzf MesaLib-3.3.tar.gz
	cd Mesa-3.3
	./configure --prefix=/usr --with-glut=/usr/src/glut-3.7
	make
	make install
	</screen>
	</para>

	<para>
	At this point, Mesa installed its own version of the glx.h include
	files over the ones that XFree86 installed.  This will cause some
	programs fail to compile and is corrected by copying the XFree86 GL include
	files from the X source back to your system:
	<screen>

	cp /usr/src/release/xc/include/GL/*.h /usr/X11R6/include/GL
	</screen>
	</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="instnvidia">
	<title>Install Nvidia OpenGL drivers</title>

	<para>
	<screen>

	-- delete the libGL.* files that come with XFree86 / Mesa 3.3
	-- the nvidia libGL.* should replace them
	cd /usr/X11R6/lib
	rm libGL.*
	cd modules/extensions
	rm libGL*
	rm libglx*
	cd /usr/lib
	rm libGL.*

	cd /usr/src
	tar -xvzf NVIDIA_kernel-0.9-4.tar.gz
	tar -xvzf NVIDIA_GLX-0.9-4.xfree401.tar.gz
	cd NVIDIA_kernel-0.9-4
	make
	cd ..
	cd NVIDIA_GLX-0.9-4.1
	make
	cd
	-- make a basic X config file
	xf86config
		follow the prompts and fill in the information it asks for
	cd /etc/X11
	You must edit XF86Config and set the following:
	vi XF86Config
		Load "dri"
		driver "nvidia"
		"1600x1200" (or your preferred screen resolution)
		copy ttf fonts from Windows into a font directory and add a font path

	-- note /usr/include/GL should be a symlink to /usr/X11R6/include/GL

	</screen>
	</para>

	<para>
	Specifying "nvidia" for the driver in the XF86Config makes that take effect
	each time you startx. But the NVdriver kernel driver will have to be
	loaded each time your system boots using:
	<screen>

		insmod NVdriver
	</screen>
	</para>

	<para>
	You can place this command in one of the system startup files, like
	/etc/rc.d/rc.modules
	</para>

	Installing GLUT is a bit tricky.  I'm not too familiar with imake, the

	get GLUT to install to where I wanted it (/usr/lib).  It can be done
