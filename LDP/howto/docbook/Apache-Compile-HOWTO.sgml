<title>Introduction</title>

<sect2>
<title>Contributors and Contacts</title>
<para>First I would thank all those people who send questions and suggestions that made a 
further development of this document possible. It shows me, sharing knowledge is the right way. 
I would encourage you to send me more suggestion, just write me an email <email>luc@delouw.ch</email>
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Why this document was written</title>
<para>All Linux-distributions I tested, had a bad defaultsetup of Apache. Additionally all major 
distributions dont have actual versions of Apache.
</para>
<para>Finally no commercial Unix comes with Apache preinstalled (Why not?)</para>
<para>Since I'm installing a lot of customized webservers on different Un*xes, I wrote a 
plaintext document and put it on my website to get access to it at work. Later a friend 
posted the URL to a mailinglist, and the first questions arrived. So I decided to put more on the page.</para>
<para>After a lot of people requested the document as an &ldquo;official&rdquo; HOWTO, I decided to do so.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>What this document is supposed to be</title>
<para>Compiling all the stuff described below needs to know a lot of configure-options that 
nobody can memorize. Its supposed to be a &ldquo;copy-paste-ready&rdquo; text to compile 
apache and friends</para>
<para>The second goal of this document is, people should lern how to build a full-featured 
Apache-webserver bythemself to be independant from any Linux distributors.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>What this document doesn't do for you</title>
<para>Its just a Document, not a script that makes the work for you. You have to do all steps by yourself.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Platforms</title>
<para>The original Document I wrote was for all major Un*x plattforms. Now the HOWTOs are 
separated for each Plattforms. You will find the same document adapted for the respective Platform for:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Linux (This Document)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>IBM AIX 4.3 and 5.1L</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Sun Solaris 6/7/8</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Hewlett-Packard HPUX 11</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>&lcub;Free|Net|Open&rcub;-BSD</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Important Notice for users running Linux on IBM S/390 (zSeries): postgres and Jserv wont compile on that system.
All other programms and modules mentioned in the HOWTO are working perfectly</para>
<para>Other Un*x-platforms: Feel free to create a guest-account for me on your Un*x platform.</para>
<para>Windows-Users: I'm sorry, I'm too young for an heart-attack ;-)</para>

<sect3><title>What is OpenSSL</title>
<para>Quoting www.openssl.org</para>
<para><emphasis>The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured,
and Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1)
protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library. The project is managed by a
worldwide community of volunteers that use the Internet to communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL toolkit
and its related documentation.</emphasis></para>
<para><emphasis>OpenSSL is based on the excellent SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young and Tim J. Hudson.
The OpenSSL toolkit is licensed under an Apache-style licence, which basically means that you are free
to get and use it for commercial and non-commercial purposes subject to some simple license conditions.</emphasis></para>
<para><emphasis>From authors poinns of view, its the basic to build a secure Unix-Server with Opensource Software, its needed
for all major products like mod_ssl, OpenSSH and lot of other stuff that provides encrypted Data-processing</emphasis></para>
 
<para>OpenSSL provides the libraries and include-files needed be the products mentioned above and also provides
a Application to build Server and client-Certificates.</para>

<sect3><title>What is MySQL</title>
<para>
Mysql is a very fast, powerful and very nice to handle Database.</para>
 
<para>Especially for Webapplication where most datas are read,
any little written, MySQL is the first choice. The newest
Version is also transaction-capable. If you plan a Webapplication,
that writes a lot of Data into the DB, maybe Postgres is
better for you.</para>
 
<para>Here you need the C-API from Mysql for compiling php if you
wish MySQL-Support in php. Its also needed if you want to use mod_authmysql, See <xref linkend="authmysql"> for more information</para>

<sect2><title>Building mm</title>
 
<sect3><title>What is mm</title>
<para>Quoting www.engelschall.com</para>
<para>The MM library is a 2-layer abstraction library which simplifies the usage of shared memory between forked
(and this way strongly related) processes under Unix platforms. On the first layer it hides all platform dependent
implementation details (allocation and locking) when dealing with shared memory segments and on the second layer
it provides a high-level malloc(3)-style API for a convenient and well known way to work with data-structures
inside those shared memory segments. </para>
<para>From the authors point of view:</para>
<para>Its a common lib that enables Unix-Programers to simplify shm accesses. Its used by a lot products i.e. PHP and mod_ssl</para>
<para>Since the author is not a programmer, he is unable to explain the exact usage of that stuff</para>

<sect3><title>What is Apache</title>

<para>Quoting www.apache.org</para>
<para>The Apache Project is a collaborative software development effort aimed at creating a robust, commercial-grade, 
featureful, and freely-available source code implementation of an HTTP (Web) server. The project is jointly managed 
by a group of volunteers located around the world, using the Internet and the Web to communicate, plan, and develop 
the server and its related documentation. These volunteers are known as the Apache Group. In addition, hundreds 
of users have contributed ideas, code, and documentation to the project. This file is intended to briefly describe 
the history of the Apache Group and recognize the many contributors.</para>
<para>From the authors point of view:</para>
<para>Its simply the best Webserver-Software, its very flexible to configure to match your needs, 
and its E-X-T-R-E-M-E stable! I personally never experianced a crash in a productive (=non-experimental stuff) enviroment</para>

<sect3><title>What is mod_perl</title>
<para>Quoting perl.apache.org</para>
<para>With mod_perl it is possible to write Apache modules entirely in Perl. In addition, the persistent 
interpreter embedded in the server avoids the overhead of starting an external interpreter and the 
penalty of Perl start-up time. </para>
<para>From the authors point of view:</para>
<para>mod_perl is some kind of substitute for cgi-bin's. cgi's typically forks for each request a new 
process, and produces a lot of overhead, with mod_perl the perl-interpreter is loaded persistant in 
the apache-server and does not need to fork any processes for each request</para>

<sect2><title>auth_ldap</title>

<sect3><title>What is auth_ldap</title>
<para>Quoting www.rudedog.org</para>
<para>auth_ldap is an LDAP authentication module for Apache, the world's most popular web server. 
auth_ldap has excellent performance, and supports Apache on both Unix and Windows NT. It 
also has support for LDAP over SSL, and a mode that lets Micros&tilde;1 Frontpage clients manage 
their web permissions while still using LDAP for authentication. </para>
<para>From the authors point of view:</para>
<para>If you like to consolidate your login-facilities to a common user/passwd base, LDAP is the right 
way. LDAP is an open standart and widly supported.</para>
<para>Login-facilities for LDAP:</para>
<para>Unix-Logins for Linux, Solaris (others?) FTP-Logins (some ftp-daemons) http Basic Authentication Tarantella 
Authentication and Role-Management Samba Authentication (2.2.x should support this, the author is  currently leading a project 
to try that pls standby) Others I forgot to mention :-) LDAP is role based, that means, you can define 
a role &quot;manager&quot; assign a user as member and that user can login wherever a manager is allowed to login</para>

<sect1 id="phpext"><title>PHP extensions</title>
<para>There are different extensions available for php, which could be added in your php.ini</para>

<sect2><title>APC (Alternative PHP-cache)</title>
<sect3><title>What is APC</title>
<para>Quoting www.apc.communityconnect.com/</para>
<para>APC is the Alternative PHP Cache. It was conceived of to provide a free, open, and robust framework for compiling 
and caching php scripts. APC was conceived of to provide a way of boosting the performance of PHP on heavily loaded sites 
by providing a way for scripts to be cached in a compiled state, so that the overhead of parsing and compiling can be 
almost completely eliminated. There are commercial products which provide this functionality, but they are neither 
open-source nor free. Our goal was to level the playing field by providing an implementation that allows greater 
flexibility and is universally accessible. We also wanted the cache to provide visibility into it's own workings and 
those of PHP, so time was invested in providing internal diagnostic tools which allow for cache diagnostics and 
maintenance. Thus arrived APC. Since we were committed to developing a product which can easily grow with new version 
of PHP, we implemented it as a zend extension, allowing it to either be compiled into PHP or added post facto as a 
drop in module. As with PHP, it is available completely free for commercial and non-commercial use, under the same terms 
as PHP itself. APC has been tested under PHP 4.0.3, 4.0.3pl1 and 4.0.4. It currently compiles under Linux and FreeBSD. 
Patches for ports to other OSs/ PHP versions are welcome.</para>
<para>From the authors point of view:</para>
<para>The author made some performance-Tests with apc and it was really surprising. A PHP-Webpage with 
mysql-queries in a loop (total 10 queries) its speedup more that 50&percnt; </para>
<para>Contra APC: If you have other users on the system coding php they maybe are not comfortable with APC, because the changes are
all ignored unless you reset the cache or restart Apache. The other way, that APC checks the php-script for a newer version 
befor every run costs speed.</para>

<para>Quoting java.apache.org</para>
<para>Apache JServ is a 100&percnt; pure Java servlet engine fully compliant with theJavaSoft Java Servlet APIs 2.0 specification.
