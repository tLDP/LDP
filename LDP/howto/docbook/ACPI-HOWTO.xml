<title>About this document</title>
<para>When I first started the switch from APM to ACPI I didn't realize the
kernel needed to be patched. My problem (insanely loud fan) was fixed just
by upgrading to 2.4.20 (Debian packaged kernel with an earlier patch from
<ulink url="http://acpi.sourceforge.net">acpi.sourceforge.net</ulink>).
Unfortunately after the first upgrade I wasn't able to
<command>halt</command> my computer without using the power switch to power-down my
computer. It wasn't until later that 
I realized I had an old, ineffectual ACPI patch. This HOWTO was
written to summarize the install process for myself, and hopefully help others who
are also having a hard time finding information about ACPI. Please note:
the main article outlines <ulink url="http://www.debian.org">The Debian Way</ulink> 
of doing things. There is also generic information in the
<xref linkend="nodebkernel" /> for those of you who prefer ... the generic way.</para>

<title>About ACPI</title>

<para>In the world of power management ACPI is relatively new to the game.
It was first released in 1996 by 
Compaq/Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Microsoft, Phoenix and Toshiba. These
developers aimed to replace the previous industry standard for power
management. Their <ulink url="http://www.acpi.info">ACPI.info</ulink> site
contains the official specifications, a list of companies that support ACPI
and a number of other goodies. This is definitely not required reading, but
may be of some interest to the insanely curious.</para>

<para>ACPI allows control of power management from within the
operating system. The previous industry standard for power management, Advanced 
Power Management (APM), is controlled at the BIOS level. APM is activated 
when the system becomes idle--the longer the system idles, the less power it
consumes (e.g. screen saver vs. sleep vs. suspend). 
In APM, the operating system has no knowledge of when the system will
change power states.</para>

<para>ACPI can typically be configured from within the operating system.
This is unlike APM where configuration often involves rebooting and
entering the BIOS configuration screens to set parameters.</para>

<para>ACPI has several different software components:</para>
<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>a subsystem which controls hardware states and 
	functions that may have previously been in the BIOS configuration</para>
	
	<para>These states include:</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>thermal control</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>motherboard configuration</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>power states (sleep, suspend)</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	</listitem>
	
	<listitem><para>a policy manager, which is software that sits on top of
the operating system and allows user input on the system
policies</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>the ACPI also has device drivers that control/monitor devices such as a
laptop battery, SMBus (communication/transmission path) and EC (embedded controller).</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>If you would like more information on power management in laptops, check out
the resources on <ulink url="http://www.tuxmobil.org">tuxmobil.org</ulink>.
Specifically: <ulink url="http://tuxmobil.org/apm_linux.html">Power Management

<sect1 id="apmtoacpi">
<title>Why switch?</title>
<para>Not all systems support both APM and ACPI. I switched because my
system only supported ACPI. Pretty easy decision really. If you're switching
to get <ulink
url="http://acpi.sourceforge.net/documentation/sleep.html">S3</ulink> (suspend
to RAM) support and you're using a 2.4.x kernel, don't bother. It is <ulink
url="http://lists.debian.org/debian-laptop/2003/debian-laptop-200304/msg00418.html">not supported</ulink>. Period.</para>

<para>Not sure if your system is supported? ACPI4Linux has a list of <ulink
url="http://acpi.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/InstallationReports">supported
machines/BIOSes</ulink> started on their Wiki. Please contribute to
the list if you've installed ACPI! They also have a list of machines that
are <ulink url="http://acpi.sourceforge.net/documentation/blacklist.html">not supported</ulink>.</para>

<para>For more information about the power management in laptops you may
(also) find the <ulink
url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/mini/Battery-Powered/index.html">Battery Powered Linux Mini-HOWTO</ulink> useful.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="dsdt">
<title>DSDT: Differentiated System Description Table</title>
<para>Thanks to <ulink url="http://www.vitavonni.de/">Erich</ulink> writing this section.</para>

<para>You might need to override the DSDT when certain features like battery
status are incorrectly reported (usually causing error messages to
syslog). DELL laptops usually need this kind of override. Fixed DSDT
for many systems are available on the <ulink
url="http://acpi.sourceforge.net/dsdt/index.php">DSDT page</ulink>, along with a patch
that tells the kernel to ignore the BIOS-supplied table but use the
compiled-in fixed DSDT.</para>

<para>Basically you need to copy
the fixed table into your kernel source with a special filename (or
modifing the filename in the patch supplied at the <ulink
url="http://acpi.sourceforge.net/dsdt/index.php">DSDT page</ulink>)
This override is quite easy: instead of loading the DSDT table from
bios, the kernel uses the compiled-in DSDT table. That's all.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="install">
<title>Installing from scratch</title>
<para>ACPI is constantly being revised. It is available in later versions
of the 2.4.x series kernel, and all 2.6.x series kernels. If you would
like to use a kernel before 2.4.22, you will need to patch your kernel
source to add ACPI functionaliy. The patches are available from
<ulink url="http://acpi.sourceforge.net">acpi.sourceforge.net</ulink>. 
You need to get the patch that exactly matches the
version of the kernel that you are running. Since this is the 
<quote>install from scratch</quote> section I will assume you know exactly 
which kernel you will be installing.</para>

<sect2 id="kernelchoice">
<title>Choosing a kernel</title>
<para>This document was originally written for the 2.4.20 kernel and has
been updated since to include information about the 2.6.x series kernels.
At the time of this update the 2.6.x series kernels are proving easy for
some and harder for others. (I personally cannot properly power down my
computer with the 2.6.5 kernel.)</para>

<para>If you can, I would recommend waiting to upgrade your kernel to the
2.6.x series until more bugs are ironed out. There are a
<emphasis>lot</emphasis> of changes in the 2.6.x series kernel. When I
upgraded to 2.6.5 to update this document I ran into problems with my
wireless connection, my nvidia graphics card, and with ACPI. Your mileage
may vary. I personally had good success with the 2.4.20 and the 2.4.22
kernels with the latest appropriate patch. A Google through your
distribution's mailing list, and the acpi-devel mailing list should help
you to pick the right kernel.</para>

<note><para>This document uses the 2.4.20 kernel as an example for 2.4.x
series kernels. Substitute your own kernel version as
appropriate.</para></note>

<para>Regardless of which kernel you choose, if it is a kernel that
requires patching, it is important to use the latest version of the ACPI patch. Some
distributions have already patched their kernels. This is the case for
Debian, and may be the case for others. For more information on the 
patches that have been applied to the Debian kernel source package scan through:
<filename>/usr/src/kernel-source-&kernel-version;/README.Debian</filename>. If you are not using Debian
you will probably still be able to find an equivalent file for your
distribution.</para>

<para>A user on acpi-support confirmed that I shouldn't need any of the
additional patches that have been applied to the kernel to run my laptop.
If you are running a production-level server and/or are serving web pages
to the internet, you should really apply any additional
security patches.</para>

<warning><para>If a kernel has had other patches applied to it, you may have
problems applying the ACPI patch. Of course, an ACPI patch should not be
applied to a kernel that is already patched for ACPI. As long as there has
not been an ACPI patch applied to the kernel it should be possible to apply
one now. Depending on the patches applied, you may need to modify some of
the Makefiles for your patch to be successful. This is beyond my current 
grasp of reality so it is not covered in this document.</para></warning>

<sect3 id="debianizedkernel">
<title>Debian-ized pre-patched kernel</title>
<para>If you would prefer to use a Debian-ized kernel instead of a fresh one,
<ulink url="http://people.debian.org/~maxx">maxx</ulink> has provided a
pre-patched kernel-source package with the latest patch for the 2.4.20
kernel. This would be instead of downloading a
fresh (non-patched) kernel from <ulink url="http://www.kernel.org">www.kernel.org</ulink>. 
He sent me an email with the following details:</para>

It should show you the one you just built. You also need to make

	<title>Extensions on Modules</title>
<para>The module name is the bit
before <filename class="extension">.o</filename> extension on a module
filename. <filename>processor.o</filename> is the file, and processor is
the module name. To install a loadable kernel module use: 
<command>insmod <replaceable>processor</replaceable></command>. </para>
	<para>
		The 2.4.x series kernels use the extension <filename
		class="extension">.o</filename>; however, the 2.6.x
		series kernel use the extension <filename
		class="extension">.ko</filename>.
	</para>
</note>

<para>The first time I rebooted I loaded them all by hand, typing
<command>insmod <replaceable>&lt;modulename&gt;</replaceable></command>. 
I personally load processor
first, although there are mixed feelings on whether or not the order
matters.</para>

<note>
<title>Operating System Power Management (OSPM)</title>
<para>The first time I tried this the modules were all in separate
directories and were ospm_&lt;name&gt;. This was probably because I was
using an old patch, but it is something to be aware of. The OSPM modules
are now deprecated so hopefully you won't see them.</para>
</note>

<para>To prevent having to load
the modules each time you reboot you can do one of two things: compile them
directly into the kernel (bit late for that though, eh?), or add them to
your <filename>/etc/modules</filename> file. If you don't already have a copy of the
file just create a new one and add each module name (remember, no
dot-o) on a separate line. You can also try running
<command>update-modules</command> which should automatically update your
<filename>/etc/modules.conf</filename> configuration file.</para>

<sect1 id="daemons">
<title>Switching from APM to ACPI</title>
<para>Do not let <application>apmd</application> and
<application>acpid</application> run at the same time unless you REALLY know
what you're doing. Debian will <emphasis>not</emphasis> make sure only one is running
at a time. You will have to check.
APM will try to put your system into S3. On the 2.4.x (and before) series
kernels this will quite probably hang your machine. S3 is not supported
until at least 2.5.x. Even the patch won't provide support for S3 in the
2.4.x series kernels. I personally did an <command>apt-get remove apmd</command> 
to solve the hanging problem.</para>

<para>You should also be aware of another little glitch I discovered. The
XFree86 server has an option for DPMS (Energy Star) features. The DPMS can
states can be one of standby, suspend,  off or on. Since the 2.4.x kernels
cannot suspend to disk, this can cause problems. I fixed my system by doing
two things:</para>
<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>
		<command>xset <option>-dpms</option></command> (disables DPMS features)
	</para></listitem>
	
	<listitem><para>

	<title>Lost Touchpad and Keyboard Interrupts</title>
	<para>Karl Hegbloom emailed me to say that <quote>keyboard
keys sticking, touchpad pointer jumping suddenly across the screen,
lockups under heavy network I/O [was] caused by
polling the battery state via ACPI and the proc file system.</quote> This
problem caused, in part, by a delay between the inital request for
information about the battery's status and the response. In that delay
interrupts may be locked out and synchronization with the keyboard and
touch pad may be lost. <quote>The overnight solution is to either turn off
the battery applet, or reduce its polling frequency.</quote> Thanks Karl!</para>

<sect1 id="usingacpi">
<title>Using ACPI</title>
<para>There are a few different applications/daemons you will want to install
on your system: <application>acpid</application> (the daemon that will control your hardware states), and <application>acpi</application> (the interface to monitor events and states) are the base install. The
<application>acpi</application> Debian package is only available in testing and is unstable. If
you're running stable you won't be able to install it without playing
around with apt and your <filename>list.sources</filename> file. You can probably
also compile from source. If you do get <application>acpi</application>
installed you can use it to monitor your system like this: <command>acpi
<option>-V</option></command>. The output will tell you about your 
system. Mine looks like this:</para>
<screen>
     Thermal 1: ok, 47.1 degrees C
     Thermal 2: ok, 45.1 degrees C
  AC Adapter 1: off-line &lt;-- running off battery
  AC Adapter 1: on-line &lt;-- running off AC power
</screen>

<para>Unfortunately, the <option>-V</option> <quote>full version</quote> doesn't work for me.
Fortunately I can still look in each of the acpi files individually for
information about my system. Check in the <filename
class="directory">/proc/acpi</filename> directory
for various things of importance. If I want to check my battery I read the
following file like this: <command>cat

    <title>PREAMBLE</title>

    <para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
    or other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
    author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
    being considered responsible for modifications made by
    others.</para>

    <para>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that
    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the
    same sense.  It complements the GNU General Public License, which
    is a copyleft license designed for free software.</para>

    <para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
    for free software, because free software needs free documentation:
    a free program should come with manuals providing the same
    freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not limited
    to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
    regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
    printed book.  We recommend this License principally for works
    whose purpose is instruction or reference.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-1">
    <title>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>

    <para>This License applies to any manual or other work that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  The "Document",
    below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the
    public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</para>

    <para>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work
    containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
    verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.</para>

    <para>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</para>

    <para>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections
    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
    in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

    <para>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that
    are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

    <para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>

    <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
    or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</para>

    <para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
    "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
    the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
    text.</para>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-2">
    <title>VERBATIM COPYING</title>

    <para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium,
    either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
    License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this
    License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
    that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
    License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
    control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</para>

    <para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
    above, and you may publicly display copies.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-3">
    <title>COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>

    <para>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</para>

    <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</para>

    <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</para>

    <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</para>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-4">
    <title>MODIFICATIONS</title>

    <para>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the
    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
    that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
    License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the
    Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
    Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition,
    you must do these things in the Modified Version:</para>

    <orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">
      <listitem><para>Use in the Title Page

    </orderedlist>
    
    <para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</para>

    <para>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</para>

    <para>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</para>

    <para>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for
    or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</para>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-5">
    <title>COMBINING DOCUMENTS</title>

    <para>You may combine the Document with other documents released
    under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
    combined work in its license notice.</para>

    <para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,
    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</para>

    <para>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
    "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
    entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
    "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
    must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-6">
    <title>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</title>

    <para>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
    other documents released under this License, and replace the
    individual copies of this License in the various documents with a
    single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
    follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of
    the documents in all other respects.</para>

    <para>You may extract a single document from such a collection,
    and distribute it individually under this License, provided you
    insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
    follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
    copying of that document.</para>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-7">
    <title>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</title>
    
    <para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
    Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</para>

    <para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
    aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
    aggregate.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-8">
    <title>TRANSLATION</title>

    <para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
    4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
    include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition
    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
    include a translation of this License provided that you also
    include the original English version of this License.  In case of
    a disagreement between the translation and the original English
    version of this License, the original English version will
    prevail.</para>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-9">
    <title>TERMINATION</title>
    
    <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
    Document except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any
    other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
    Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
    rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.</para>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-10">
    <title>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</title>

    <para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
    versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
    version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
    concerns.  See <ulink
    url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</ulink>.</para>

    <para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
    version number.  If the Document specifies that a particular
    numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to
    it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that specified version or of any later version that has
    been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-11">
    <title>How to use this License for your documents</title>

    <para>To use this License in a document you have written, include
    a copy of the License in the document and put the following
    copyright and license notices just after the title page:</para>

<blockquote><para>
      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1

      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".
</para></blockquote>

    <para>If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
    Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have
    no Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover
    Texts.</para>

    <para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
    code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
    choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public
    License, to permit their use in free software.</para>
