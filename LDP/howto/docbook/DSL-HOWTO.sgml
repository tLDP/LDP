<Para>
 This document examines the DSL family of high speed Internet services now
 being deployed in various markets worldwide.  Information is included on the
 technology behind DSL as well as subscribing, installing, configuring, and
 troubleshooting, with an emphasis on how this impacts Linux users.

<Sect1 id="intro">
<Title>Introduction</Title>

<Para>
 DSL, or Digital Subscriber Loop, is a high-speed Internet access technology
 that uses a standard copper telephone line (a.k.a. <Quote>loop</Quote> in
 telco parlance). DSL provides a direct, dedicated connection to an ISP via
 the existing telco network. DSL is designed to run on up to 80% of the
 telephone lines available in the United States. By using line-adaptive
 modulation, DSL is capable of providing data speeds of 8 Mbps, or more. 

</Para>

<Para>
 DSL services are now being aggressively marketed for home and small business
 use. DSL is typically priced below ISDN, and well below T1 service, yet can
 provide potentially even greater speeds than T1 without the
 cost, complexity, and availability issues of T1. Since DSL is a dedicated,
 often <Quote>always on</Quote> service, it avoids the delays and use charges
 that are common with ISDN. Making this quite a nice technology for the
 bandwidth starved masses.

</Para>

<Para>
 While all this sounds exciting, DSL does have some drawbacks. The quality of
 the DSL signal, and thus the connection, depends on distance (the length of
 the copper <Quote>loop</Quote>) and various other factors. Also, there is no
 such thing as standard <Quote>DSL</Quote>. There are various flavors of DSL,
 and many, many ways DSL providers are implementing their networks. In typical
 fashion, Linux users are often left to fend for themselves, since the DSL
 providers are often taking the easy way out, and catering only to
 <Quote>mainstream</Quote> Operating Systems.

</Para>

<Para>
 The topics included in this HOWTO include qualification and pre-installation,
 installation, configuration, troubleshooting and securing a DSL connection. As
 well as other related topics. There are also appendices including a
 comprehensive <Link LinkEnd="overview">DSL Overview</Link>, <link
 linkend="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</link>, a listing of <link
 linkend="links">related links</link>, and a <link
 linkend="glossary">glossary</link>. </Para>

<Para>
 Due to the fast pace of change in the telco and DSL industries, please make
 sure you have the latest version of this document. The current official

<Sect2>
<Title>Document Structure and Reading Guidelines</Title>

<Para>
 This document attempts to give a comprehensive discussion of DSL. All aspects 
 are hopefully addressed to one degree or another with what can be a complex
 topic since it deals with networking, hardware, new fangled technologies, and 
 various approaches taken by various vendors. The core components of this
 document are:
 
</Para>

<Para>
 <ItemizedList>

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    The <Link LinkEnd="installation">Installation</Link> section covers
    installation of DSL hardware and related components, including wiring
    considerations, splitter or microfilter installation, modem and Network
    card installation. 
       
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    The <Link LinkEnd="configure">Configuring Linux</Link> section covers
    mostly client and software aspects of getting the connection up and
    running. The Network card configuration is actually covered mostly in the
    above Installation section.
    
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    The <Link LinkEnd="secure">Securing Your Connection</Link> section covers
    Security implications that are even more important with a full-time
    connection. Linux users seem especially targeted by crackers, because
    quite frankly, some don't understand how important security is, or don't
    understand the finer points of this.
 
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    The <Link LinkEnd="tuning">Tuning and Troubleshooting</Link> section
    covers post-installation topics like how well is our connection performing,
    and how to track down any show-stoppers or intermittent problems.
   
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    There is also a lengthy Appendix that covers various topics relating to
    Linux and DSL. None of these are directly related to simply getting that
    connection up and running, but may be of interest nonetheless.
  
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

 </ItemizedList>
</Para>



<Para>
 To simplify the navigation of this document, below is a suggested reading 
 guideline. Everyone should read the Introduction. Please pay special
 attention to the <Link LinkEnd="usage">Conventions and Terminology</Link>
 section, as some of this terminology may be used somewhat differently in
 other contexts. Also, there is a <Link LinkEnd="glossary">Glossary</Link> if
 you get lost in the world of TA (telco acronyms) ;-).
 
</Para>

<Para>
 <ItemizedList>

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If you don't know anything about DSL, you should probably read the entire 
    document section. You may want to start with the <Link LinkEnd="overview">DSL
    Overview</Link> section in the Appendix, and then the <Link
    LinkEnd="faq">FAQ</Link>. The DSL Overview explains how the various pieces
    of the puzzle fit together. DSL network implementations are more complex
    than traditional dialup networks. 
    
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If you have already done some homework, but have not ordered service from
    anyone yet, read the <Link LinkEnd="cproviders">Choosing
    Providers</Link> section, and the <Link LinkEnd="isps">Linux Friendly
    ISPs</Link> sections. Also, you might get a head start by reading the
    <Link LinkEnd="configure">Configuring Linux</Link> section so you know
    what lies ahead.

   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If you have ordered service already, and are awaiting delivery, you can
    skip the sections on choosing a Provider. If you will be doing a
    self-install, you should read the pertinent parts of the <Link
    LinkEnd="installation">Installation</Link> section, the <Link
    LinkEnd="configure">Configuring Linux</Link> section, and the <Link
    LinkEnd="secure">Securing Your Connection</Link> section.
   
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If the installation is complete, and you can't get a working connection, 
    skip right to the <Link LinkEnd="tuning">Troubleshooting</Link> Section. 
    If you are not clear on what protocols are required, or what software you 
    need to have installed, also read the <Link
    LinkEnd="configure">Configuring Linux</Link> section. If not sure what
    terms like <Quote>sync</Quote> mean in this context, then be sure to read
    the <Link LinkEnd="overview">DSL Overview</Link> section first so you know
    how it all fits together.
 
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If trying to decide between cable and DSL, read the 
    <Link LinkEnd="cable">Cable vs DSL</Link> section, and possibly the 
    <Link LinkEnd="overview">DSL Overview</Link> section.
  
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If you have never had a full-time Internet connection, or are not
    absolutely sure you fully understand how to secure you connection, 
    be sure to read The <Link LinkEnd="secure">Securing Your Connection</Link>
    section. If you don't understand some aspect of this, re-read it, or start 
    looking for other references.
  
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 
  
  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    There is a comprehensive <Link LinkEnd="links">Links section</Link> that 
    has references to some topics not touched on in the main body of the 
    Document itself.

<Title>New Versions</Title>

<Para>
 The latest version is 1.1. There are quite a few minor corrections, updates, 
 and additions. Not much that is substantially new. There are finally two
 Linux compatible DSL PCI modems from Xpeed. The drivers are now in the kernel
 2.2.18 source.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Version .99 addresses some of the many changes that have occurred since the
 original ADSL mini HOWTO was published. Originally, ADSL was the primary DSL
 technology being deployed, but more and more some of the other DSL flavors
 are entering the picture -- IDSL, SDSL, G.Lite, and RADSL. Thus the renaming
 from <Quote>ADSL mini HOWTO</Quote> to the <Quote>DSL HOWTO</Quote>. There
 have been many other changes in DSL technology as well. PPPoE/A encapsulation
 has become more and more common as many ISPs are jumping on this bandwagon. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 The contents have additionally been re-organized, with new sections added on
 security, and troubleshooting, and as well as many additions to the <link

<Sect2 id="usage">
<Title>Conventions, Usage and Terminology</Title>

<Para>
 For the sake of simplicity and sanity, let's clarify some of the terminology
 that we will be using in this document, so that we are all on the same page.
 While many of the definitions below are not always 100% technically correct,
 they are close enough for our purposes here. In fast moving technologies like
 DSL, there are so many <Quote>ifs, ands, and buts</Quote> that it is
 difficult to say anything with any degree of certainty and have it stick. And
 there are exceptions to almost every rule. And sometimes exceptions to the
 exceptions. We will be dealing with generalities to a large degree here,
 please keep that in mind. 

</Para>

<Para>
 <ItemizedList>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <Quote>DSL</Quote> will be used to refer to the entire family of DSL
   technologies now available  -- ADSL, SDSL, IDSL, RADSL, etc. ADSL still
   seems to be the most prevalent at this time, but the others are being
   deployed more and more. Where it is important to differentiate one type of
   DSL from another, the full proper name will be used: e.g. RADSL. xDSL is
   also commonly used to refer to the various DSL technologies as a group, but
   we will be using just <Quote>DSL</Quote> here.

  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   The term <Quote>telco</Quote> here refers to any potential DSL provider.
   This includes the ILECs (Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers), a.k.a. the old
   guard phone companies, and the CLECs (Competitive Local Exchange Carriers),
   or independent providers such as Covad and Rhythms. Both are providing DSL
   services over existing copper lines.

  </Para>
 </ListItem>
 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <Quote>CO</Quote> is the telco acronym for <Quote>Central Office</Quote>.
   Traditionally this is a building where one end of your phone line
   physically terminates. The other end terminates at your home, office, or
   wherever. It will be used here to refer to the telco end termination point,
   regardless of whether it is a traditional Central Office building or
   another, smaller, remote structure or device.
  
  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <Quote>Loop</Quote> is telco speak for <Quote>phone line</Quote>.
   Essentially, you should think of your loop as one dedicated pair of copper
   wires that run uninterrupted from your residence or office directly to the
   CO. This is perhaps an oversimplification, but will serve our purposes. DSL
   availability, and signal quality, is tied directly to the characteristics
   of your physical line -- or <Quote>loop</Quote> as they say.
   
  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <quote>POTS</quote> is the acronym for Plain Old Telephone Service. In other
   words, traditional, non-digital devices like phones, faxes and answering
   machines. 

  </Para>
 </ListItem>
 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <quote>NID</quote>, or Network Interface Device, is the small telco 
   housing that is typically attached to the outside wall of your house, and
   is the service entrance for telco services. This may variously also be
   referred to as <quote>ONI</quote>, <quote>SNI</quote>, <quote>NIU</quote>,
   or other creative telco acronyms. It represents the
   <quote>demarcation</quote> point that divides the customer's realm of
   responsibility from the telco's. Commercial structures, and multi-family 
   housing will likely have something more sophisticated.
  
  </Para>
 </ListItem> 


 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <Quote>DSLAM</Quote> is the sophisticated hardware device in the telco's CO
   where your phone line physically terminates, and thus makes DSL happen.
   Increasingly, telcos are making use of smaller devices like the
   <Quote>mini-RAM</Quote> in remote locations. We'll use <Quote>DSLAM</Quote>
   here as a catchall for any device that enables DSL service from a telco.
   
  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <Quote>Modem</Quote> will be used to refer to the end user device that
   enables a DSL connection. Your modem is connected to the telco's DSLAM in
   the CO via your loop. When they are <Quote>talking</Quote> DSL to each
   other, they are in <Quote>sync</Quote>. Without <Quote>sync</Quote>, no
   connection to your ISP is possible. 
  
  </Para>
   
  <Para> 
   <Quote>Modem</Quote> is indeed the correct terminology since there is
   MOdulation and DEModulation of the signal. These modems typically have
   other features too. Some ISPs and manufacturers may be marketing simply
   <Quote>routers</Quote>, <Quote>bridges</Quote>, or even
   <Quote>brouters</Quote> for this purpose. These are essentially DSL modems
   with enhancements. A compatible <Quote>modem</Quote> of some kind is the
   minimum hardware requirement at the customer's end of the connection. The
   most commonly supplied modem is actually a combination bridge and modem.

  </Para>

  <Para>
   Unless stated otherwise, we will also be assuming the <Quote>modem</Quote>
   has an ethernet interface, and will connect to a standard Network Card
   (NIC). This is far and away the most prevalent configuration, at least
   until more Linux drivers are available for PCI and USB modems.
 
  </Para>

  <Para>
   It is worth noting that <Quote>routers</Quote> as supplied by DSL providers
   are typically modem/router combination devices. In our context,
   <Quote>router</Quote> will refer to these devices as such. There are also
   SOHO routers available that are only dedicated routers and lack the modem
   functionality. 
 
  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   Previous versions of this document referred to the modem as an 
   <Quote>ANT</Quote> (ADSL Network Termination). While this may be
   technically correct terminology, it is not used by ISPs, manufacturers,
   telcos, or most users to any extent.  The <Quote>modem</Quote> will be just
   called a modem, regardless of whatever other features it may have (i.e.
   router, bridge, etc.).

  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
  PPPoX will be used to refer to PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet) and PPPoA
  (PPP over ATM) collectively. These protocols are being used by many DSL
  providers now.

  </Para>
 </ListItem> 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   The information provided in this document is based on the current state of
   DSL in the U.S. I would assume there are enough similarities with
   DSL services outside of the US that this document would still have some
   merit for everyone. Correct me if I am wrong by emailing 
   <email>hal@foobox.net</email>.
   
  </Para>
 </ListItem>
 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   A <Quote>#</Quote> will be used to denote a command that typically is run
   by the root user. Otherwise, a <Quote>$</Quote> will be used as the prompt
   for non-root users.

<Title>Pre-Installation</Title>

<Para>
 Beyond the obvious consideration of price, there are many reasons to
 investigate which providers may be offering DSL services in your area. The
 large Telephone companies are everywhere, and may advertise the most. But
 increasingly smaller ISPs and independents are getting into the act. This is
 creating diversity in the DSL marketplace. A good thing of course, but
 possibly creating a little confusion too. 

</Para>

<Para>
 Not all DSL services are alike. Just because two local companies are offering 
 <Quote>ADSL</Quote>, does not mean that necessarily there is much in common
 at all. In fact, there are potentially a number of factors that make one ADSL
 provider's service significantly different from another's. Some things to

 Once you have chosen a provider, and ordered service, the next step is for
 the telco to <Quote>qualify</Quote> your loop. This essentially means testing
 your line to make sure it can handle the DSL signal, and possibly what level
 of service may be available to you. This may take some time, especially if
 the telco encounters problems with the loop. If no problems are found during
 this phase, then possibly there will be a two to three week wait for the
 installation. YMMV.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 After the telco has qualified the loop and readied their end of the
 connection, the next step is installation of the necessary components at the
 customer's end of the connection: wiring modifications, splitter or filters,
 and, of course the modem and any necessary software.

<Title>Installation Options -- Self Install or Not</Title>

<Para>
 You may or may not have a choice on how the installation is done, or who
 does it. This is totally at the discretion of the provider. Many providers
 offer a <Quote>self install</Quote> option where you do all the work. In this
 scenario, the provider will send a kit in order to save them from sending a
 tech, and thus reducing cost. Typically, self install kits will include
 microfilters for the POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) phone jacks, the
 modem (and maybe a NIC), and a CDROM with drivers, etc. on it. In some cases,
 a splitter may be included instead of microfilters. In any case, some type 
 of filtering is necessary on the non-DSL lines. If not the noise generated 
 by the DSL signal may interfere with POTS devices.

<comment>From what I understand (this may be completely rumor and
superstition) most of the time when a "splitter" needs to be installed
at, or near the telco's demarc, a "self install" is not an option.  A
certified telco technician may need to come install the splitter.

HB -- It may be rare, but there self install kits with a splitter. In fact, if
memory serves, the original ADSL mini had this type of installation.

</comment>
 
</Para>

<Para>
 The other possibility is for the provider to do the
 installation. Obviously, the cost is higher here, but it may have the
 advantage of having a trained tech do any wiring. There is also a
 better chance of getting a <quote>splittered</quote> installation
 with this option (a good thing!). Another benefit is that if
 something is wrong with the line, or the telco has not provisioned
 the line properly, an on-site tech may be able to help sort out certain 
 kinds of problems quickly.
 
<comment>Most of the technicians here in Qwest land are "pole
jockeys", who don't know anything about DSL, or about computers.  They
come out and install the line, but may not know more than "put this CD
in, click on install".</comment>

</Para>

<Para>
 The self-install kit should come with full instructions, regardless of whether
 the installation will be splittered or filtered. So we won't go into much
 detail on this aspect.

<Title>Wiring/Installation Options</Title>

<Para>
 There are various wiring schemes depending on how your service is being
 provided, who is providing it, and which DSL service is being provided.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 <ItemizedList>
  
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    <Emphasis>Dedicated Line</Emphasis>. Some DSLs require a dedicated, or
    <Quote>dry</Quote>, wire pair, e.g. IDSL. This means a separate, physical
    line for DSL and Internet connectivity. Also, DSL services from CLECs
    (independent telcos like Covad or Rhythms), will use a dedicated line
    since the ILEC will not share one line with another company. (Instead the
    CLEC will actually lease a loop from the ILEC.) One your end, this simply
    means using one of the unused wire pairs in the telco wire bundle, and
    connecting it to the DSL jack.
   
   </Para>
 </ListItem> 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <Emphasis>Shared Line with Splitter</Emphasis>. For DSLs like ADSL, that
   are provided over the same line as regular voice service (POTS), the signal
   must be filtered somehow so that voice services are not adversely effected.
   Installing a splitter splits the line into two pairs, and filters the DSL
   signal from one of them. This results in a inside wiring scheme where DSL
   goes to only one jack, and then POTS service to all other jacks. This is
   considered by many to be a better type of installation than
   <Quote>splitterless</Quote>, i.e. with microfilters instead.
  
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   Splitters are available from various manufacturers and come in various
   shapes and sizes. Some are small enough to fit in the NID itself (sometimes
   called SNI, this is the telco phone box on the outside of your house),
   while others have a housing as large as the NID itself. Typically this is
   mounted near the NID, on the customer's side of the demarcation point.

  </Para>
 
 </ListItem> 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <Emphasis>Shared Line with Filters</Emphasis>. Again, for DSLs that
   piggyback on the POTS line, the signal must be filtered or split at some
   point. The other way of doing this is by placing RJ11
   <Quote>microfilters</Quote> in each phone jack -- <Emphasis>except where
   the DSL modem will be</Emphasis>. These filters are relatively small,
   plug-in devices and remove the higher frequencies associated with DSL. This
   is obviously much easier since no tools or wiring is required. This is
   often what is included in self-install kits, and is often referred to as a
   <Quote>splitterless</Quote> installation.
  
  </Para>
 </ListItem> 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <Emphasis>Shared Line, Splitterless and Filterless</Emphasis>. Some newer
   DSLs, like G.Lite, have no adverse effect on regular POTS devices and thus
   require no filters or splitters. This would seem to be the wave of the
   future. Just plug and play. Though still not very common.

<Para>
 If you are not doing the self-install option, then you may skip this section

<Para>
 The first step will be to wire up the connections from your provider. Identify
 the line on which service will be installed, and the locations of your
 splitter and DSL jack(s). (For perhaps a better wiring scheme, see the 
 Homerun section immediately below.)
</Para>

<Para>
 Be aware that typical telco wire has more than one pair per bundle. Often,
 two pairs, but sometimes more. If you have but one phone line, the other
 pair(s) are unused. This makes them available for use with wiring for DSL.
 Wire pairs are color coded for easy identification. SDSL and IDSL require a
 dedicated, or <Quote>dry</Quote>, pair. If an unused pair is available, then
 no real re-wiring is required. It is just a matter of re-wiring an existing
 jack for the correct pair of wires, and attaching the modem.

<Para>
 Perhaps a somewhat better method of wiring for the DSL modem is sometimes
 called a <Quote>homerun</Quote>. It is called this because it is one,
 straight shot from the splitter to the modem's DSL jack. What this does is
 bypass the existing inside wiring altogether, and any problems that might be
 lurking there -- like a corroded connection somewhere on a POTS jack. Inside
 wiring defects can be a source of headaches, especially in older homes. 

</Para> 
 
<Para> It also allows you to route the cable to avoid any potential
 RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) sources. RFI anywhere in the
 circuit can be a DSL killer. Routing the cable away from items that
 may have electric motors, transformers, power supplies, high
 intensity lighting fixtures, dimmer switches and such, is a smart way
 to go. And you are also less likely to have a failing microfilter
 cause problems -- one potential point of failure instead of several. You can
 also use a better grade of cable such as CAT 5 or shielded twisted pair wire.

</Para>

<Para>
 If your existing installation is <quote>splitterless</quote> (i.e. using
 microfilters) now, this will entail purchasing a splitter. And, of course,
 will also mean some new wiring will need to be run. Microfilters also add
 to the effective loop length -- as much as 700 ft per filter in some
 cases! So if you have several microfilters installed, and your sync rate or
 distance is marginal, eliminating these filters may result in a significant
 improvement.

<comment>This paragraph could be clearer, I think.  I've got a pretty
good idea what it means, after a few times reading it.

<Para>
 If you have the splitterless design (i.e. using <Quote>microfilters</Quote>)
 or a dedicated line, you may skip this part.

</Para>

<Para>
 The splitter will typically consist of two parts, the splitter and a small
 outdoor housing. Mount the splitter and accompanying housing per the telco's
 instructions at the Network Interface Device (NID) point (also sometimes
 called the SNI or ONI), usually the side of your house where the phone line
 is located. Put it on your side of the NID. The phone company may need
 to access the splitter for maintenance, so its advisable to locate it on the
 outside where they can get at it, but outside is not absolutely
 necessary.

<comment>Which term are you going to use?  SNI, NID, demarc,
ONI?
HB -- 10/4. NID!
</comment>

</Para> 
 
<Para> 
 The wire bundle should have at least two separate wire pairs. The splitter
 takes one pair, and separates the signal onto two pairs. One pair in the
 bundle will then go to all POTS jacks, and the other to the modem's DSL wall
 jack. So connect the incoming telco line to the LINE side of the splitter.
 Then wire the inside pair for your telephone to the VOICE, and your inside
 wire pair for the modem to DATA. 

</Para>


<Para>
 <Emphasis remap="bf">Checkstep </Emphasis> At this point, you should be able
 to pull dial tone off the voice side of the splitter. If this doesn't work,
 then you've wired it wrong. You can also plug the modem into the test jack in
 the NID box (most should have this). Plug in the modem's power cord, and
 if the line is provisioned correctly, you should <Quote>sync</Quote> in less
 than a minute.  This test only requires the modem.  (Internal and USB modems
 probably will require a driver to be loaded before syncing. This means having

 To install, connect the modem's (or router's) power cord, and connect

 the modem syncs with the telco's DSLAM signal. Most modems have a
 green LED that lights up when the signal is good, and red or orange
 if not in sync. The modem's manual will have more details on the
 LEDs. If it doesn't sync, then check your wiring, or make sure that
 the DSL signal is being sent. Do this by calling your telco and
 verifying they have activated the service. Or by testing the modem at
 the test jack on the NID (see above). Note that having dial tone
 on the line does NOT confirm the presence of the DSL data signal. And
 vice versa -- perfectly possible to have dial tone and no DSL, or DSL
 and no dial tone. There should also be no static or noise on the
 voice line when everything is installed and functioning properly.

 Before we get too far into the final stages of installing and
 configuring our system, let's look at how various DSL ISPs set up
 their networks. It will be very important for you know how your ISP
 does this, as there is more than one possibility and the steps
 involved are quite different for each. This may not be the kind of
 thing the ISP is advertising, and since you are not using Windows,
 you may not have access to the setup disk that the ISP provides. If
 you're not sure, ask the ISP's tech support staff, or other users.

 To muddy the waters even more, some ISPs may be offering more than one kind

 The two most common DSL network implementations are Bridged/DHCP and PPPoX.
 Both have mechanisms for obtaining an IP address and other related networking
 configuration details so we shouldn't have to worry about this. Our job will
 be finding the right client, and doing what we have to, to get it up and
 running.
 
</Para>


<Para>
 <Emphasis>Important!</Emphasis> You need to know beforehand how your ISP is
 setup for connecting to his network. To re-iterate, the two main
 possibilities are Bridged/DHCP and PPPoE. These are mutually exclusive
 implementations. So you will need either one or the other, and it must be the
 right one or you will waste a lot of time and effort. You cannot choose which
 one either. It is a matter of how the ISP is doing his network. Note that
 PPPoE can run over Bridged networks, so just knowing whether you are Bridged
 or not, is not necessarily good enough. PPPoA is yet another alternative. If
 your provider is giving you a router, there is a good chance that the
 router's firmware will handle all of this for you. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 If you are subscribing with one of the Baby Bells in the U.S., you can
 probably count on that being PPPoE, and thus you will need a PPPoE client.

<Title>Bridged/DHCP</Title>

<Para>
 In the good old days of a year or two ago, <Quote>Bridged</Quote> connections
 were the norm. This type of network puts you on a local subnet just like a
 big LAN. You are exposed to much of the local subnet traffic, especially ARP
 and broadcast traffic. The typical means of authenticating in this set up, is
 via DHCP. 
</Para

<Para>
 DHCP is a standard, established networking protocol for obtaining an IP
 address and other important network parameters (e.g.  nameservers). This is a
 standard, well documented networking scheme and is very easy to set up
 from the end user's perspective. It is also a very stable connection. You
 can actually unplug the modem for say 10 minutes, plug it back in, let it
 re-sync, and the connection is still there -- same IP and everything. 

</Para>

<Sect3>
<Title>PPPoX</Title>

<Para>
 The main alternative now is PPPoX, meaning either PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet)
 or PPPoA (PPP over ATM). Both of these related protocols are currently being
 deployed, but at the moment, PPPoE seems to be the more common of the two.
 PPPoX is a relative newcomer, and, as the name implies, is a variation of
 Point-to-Point Protocol that has been adapted specifically for DSL providers.
</Para>

<Para>
 There are several PPPoE clients for Linux (<Link LinkEnd="pppoe">see
 below</Link>). At this moment, PPPoA support is in beta, but should be
 available very soon. PPPoX simulates a dialup type environment. The user is
 authenticated by user id and password which is passed to a RADIUS server,
 just like good ol' dialup PPP. A routable IP address, and other related
 information, is returned to the client. Of course, no actual dialing takes
 place. The mechanics of how this is handled, will vary from client to client,
 so best to RTFM closely. Typically you will set up configuration files like
 <Filename>pap-secrets</FileName>, etc.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 From the ISPs perspective, PPP is much easier to maintain and troubleshoot.
 From the end user's perspective, it is more work to set up, uses more CPU,
 and the connection is maybe not as stable. So anyway, this seems to be the
 coming trend. Many of the large telcos, especially the RBOCs (Baby Bells),
 have committed to PPPoX already. Setting up a PPPoX connection is completely
 different from setting up a bridged/DHCP connection.

<Title>ATM</Title>

<Para>
 Since the traffic on the wire from the DSLAM to the modem is ATM, a
 raw ATM connection would seem to make sense. While possible, this is
 rare, if it exists at all in the U.S, and would require a modem in
 addition to a PCI ATM card, such as the Efficient Networks
 3010. There is an ATM project for Linux, that is being incorporated
 into the 2.4 kernel. (See the <Link LinkEnd="links">Links
 section</Link> for more information.)

<Title>Configuring the WAN Interface</Title>

<Para>
 The most common configuration is a DSL modem in <Quote>bridging</Quote> mode.
 Both PPPoX and DHCP can use this setup. In this scenario, the WAN interface
 typically means your NIC. This is where your system meets the outside world.
 (If you have a router see <Link LinkEnd="router">below</Link> for router
 specific instructions.) So essentially we will be configuring the NIC,
 typically <Quote>eth0</Quote> since it is an ethernet interface. 
 
</Para> 
 
<Para>
 With PPPoX, once the connection comes up, there will be a
 <Quote>ppp0</Quote>, or similar, interface, just like dialup. This will
 become the WAN interface once the connection to the PPP server is up, but for
 configuration purposes we will we be concerned with <Quote>eth0</Quote>
 initially.

<Title>Static IP Configuration</Title>

<Para>
 A <Quote>static</Quote> IP address is an IP that is guaranteed not to change.
 This is the preferred way to go for those wanting to host a domain or run
 some type of public server, but is not available from all ISPs. Note that
 while there are some noteworthy benefits to having a static IP, the
 disadvantage is that is more difficult to remain <quote>invisible</quote>. It
 is harder to hide from those with malicious intentions. Skip this section if
 you do not have a static IP, or if you have a router, and the router will be
 assigned the static IP.

<Para>
 Configure the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server
 information as provided by the ISP. Each Linux Distribution (Redhat, Debian,
 Slackware, SuSE, etc.) has a different way of doing this, so check on your
 distro's docs on this. Each may have their own tools for this. Redhat has
 <Command>netcfg</Command> for example. You can also do this manually using
 the <Command>ifconfig </Command> and <Command>route</Command> commands. See
 the man pages on these or the  <Ulink

<Sect3>
<Title>Bridged/DHCP Configuration</Title>

<Para>
 ISPs that have Bridged networks typically use DHCP to assign an IP addresses,
 and authenticate the user. All distributions come with one or more DHCP
 clients. <Command>dhcpcd</Command> seems to be the most common.
 <Command>pump</Command> comes with Redhat based distributions as of Redhat
 6.0. The DHCP client will obtain an IP <Quote>lease</Quote> from the ISP's
 server as well as other related information: gateway address, DNS servers,
 and network mask. The lease will be <Quote>renewed</Quote> at regular
 intervals according to the ISP's configuration. 

</Para>

<Para>
 You will want the DHCP client started on boot, so use your distribution's
 means of doing this. There generally is little to configure with DHCP as it
 is fairly straightforward and easy to use. You may need to tell it which
 interface to listen on if the NIC is something other than
 <Quote>eth0</Quote>. You can also start it from the command line to get
 started. See the respective man pages for more. 
  
</Para>

<Para>
 Unless you have a static IP, the ISP will need some way to know who you are
 when you connect. There are two ways this authentication process is
 accomplished with DHCP. The first and most common method is via the MAC (or
 hardware) address of the network device. Typically this would be the NIC. The
 MAC address is a unique identifier and can be found among the boot messages,
 or with <Command>ifconfig</Command>, and looks something like 
 <Literal>00:50:04:C2:19:BC</Literal>.  You will need to give the ISP the MAC
 address before your first connection. 
</Para> 
 
<Para> 
 The other DHCP authentication method is via an assigned hostname. In this
 case, the ISP will have provided you with this information. Your DHCP client
 will need to pass this information to the server in order for you to connect. 
 Both <Command>dhcpcd</Command> and <Command>pump</Command> accept the
 <Quote>-h</Quote> command line option for this purpose. See the client's man
 page, or your distribution's documentation, for specifics.

</Para>

     Done, HB.

 <Para>
  For PPPoX, the correct setting for the ppp0 interface MTU is 1492. If the
  MTU is set too high, it may cause failure of some web pages to load
  properly, and possibly other annoying problems. You may need to also set the
  MTU for interfaces on any masqueraded LAN connections MTU to 1452. 
 </Para>
</Note>

<!--

8. Configure LAN Hosts

If you have a LAN behind the firewall, you have to lower the TCP
maximum segment size from the normal 1460 to 1452 (or better, 1412.)
You have two options: Either set the MTU of all the interfaces on
other hosts on the LAN to 1452, or use the "-m 1412" option to pppoe.
The "-m" option for pppoe is far simpler and makes it easier to add
hosts to the LAN, but consumes some extra CPU time.

If you want to manually configure the LAN hosts, here's how:

In Linux, use: "ifconfig eth0 mtu 1452".  For best results, put this
in an /etc/rc.d/rc.local script.

For Windows, machines, see http://lan.cns.ksu.edu/OS/WIN95/slip95.htm.
Set the MaxMTU to 1452.

==
E) pppoe dies with the log message "Message too long"

You set the MTU of the Ethernet interface connected to the ADSL modem
to less than 1500.  Don't do that.
-->
 
<Para>
 Actually, for PPPoE the real setting should be at least 8 bytes less than any
 interface between you and the ultimate destination. All routers normally
 would be set to 1500, thus 1492 is correct from your end. But, it may happen
 that somewhere a router is misconfigured at a lower setting, and this can
 cause problems, especially with web pages loading. The way to test this is to
 keep dropping the MTU until things work.

<Title>PPPoA</Title>

<Para>
 PPPoA (PPP over ATM) is a cleaner solution than PPPoE since most of the work
 is done in hardware, and since the raw DSL traffic is ATM. There is no client
 necessary to manage the connection as with PPPoE. Authentication is still the
 same: user id and password to connect, but the mechanics are different since
 no ethernet encapsulation takes place.

</Para>

<Para>
 As of this moment, there is not really a viable, working implementation of
 PPPoA for Linux. There is an ATM patch for 2.2 kernels, support for ATM in
 the 2.4.x kernel, and a project based on the Efficient Networks 3010
 [possibly out of production], as well as other ATM cards. The ATM on Linux
 homepage is here: <Ulink URL="http://lrcwww.epfl.ch/linux-atm/">

 URL="http://www.sfgoth.com/~mitch/linux/atm/pppoatm/">
 http://www.sfgoth.com/~mitch/linux/atm/pppoatm/</Ulink> from the kernel
 developer of this project. Existing PPPoA implementations are hardware/driver
 based, and Linux PPPoA modem drivers are scarce as hen's teeth at this time.
 The above modem does not seem to be available through normal retail channels.
 This may be a problem, if this is the only protocol an ISP delivers. At
 the very least, some rather serious hoop jumping is in order. 

</Para>

<Para>
 If PPPoA is your ISP's only option, you should probably consider one of the
 router/modems that can handle PPPoA, and let the hardware handle everything.

<Sect3 id="router">
<Title>Modem/Router Configuration</Title>

<Para>
 Some ISPs are providing <Quote>routers</Quote> as the connection device.
 Essentially these are mini routers with built in modems. These are all
 ethernet based devices too, so Linux should be good to go here as well.
 Again, a compatible, working NIC should be all that is required to make this
 work.

</Para>
 
<Para> 
 A <Quote>router</Quote> has many advantages. The better ones can handle the
 connection management, IP encapsulation, and authentication, as well as
 providing a means of segregating your LAN from outside traffic, and possibly
 other features too. In short they can do it all. One big advantage is that
 they can handle whatever protocols your ISP requires in order to connect. 

</Para> 
 
<Para>
 If the ISP is requiring PPPoX, then this makes life a little easier since you
 will not have to install or configure any additional software just to use
 their network. The modem's firmware will handle this. The downside is that
 most of these do not have the flexibility of a Linux router, or other
 software solution. Of course, you could set up a Linux router behind the
 router, and have the best of both worlds. The ones with more and better
 features are also going to cost significantly more.

</Para>

<Para>
 While the physical installation of a router is very similar to the modem
 installation (see above), the router configuration itself is different
 since your first <Quote>hop</Quote> will be the router's interface and not
 the ISP's gateway. Routers will actually have two interfaces -- one that you
 connect to from the LAN side, and one that connects to your ISP on the WAN
 side. Your point of exposure here is the WAN interface of the router. 

</Para>

<Para> 
 The router will also have a pre-configured, private IP address that you will
 connect to from the LAN side. This will be your gateway. The public IP
 address will be assigned to the WAN side interface. Typically these devices
 also act as DHCP servers for the LAN side as well. So possibly all you have
 to do is to start a DHCP client such as <Command>dhcpcd</Command> or
 <Command>pump</Command> (Redhat based distros) to get up and running. Just
 make sure the modem/router is syncing first. The appropriate steps and
 configuration should be in the owner's manual, or available from your
 provider. 

<comment>which provider?

HB -- The modem usually is ISP issue. But I believe in some cases it is from
telco. Left intentionally ambiguous.

</comment>

</Para>

<Para>
 If you are a PPPoX customer, and the router is handling this part of the
 connection, then you will have to configure at least your user id and
 password before connecting. If a Bridged/DHCP customer, you should just have
 to activate DHCP on the router, and possibly register the MAC (hardware
 address) of the router with your provider. Some routers have <Quote>MAC
 cloning</Quote> which means that they will report the MAC address of the
 attached NIC. If static IP, then you will have to configure this as well.

</Para>

<Para>
 If you need to access the router directly, you will need to know the
 manufacturer's default setting for its IP address. See the owner's manual, or
 ask your provider. You will then have to set your NIC's interface to the same
 network as the router. For instance, if the router has an IP of 10.0.0.1, set
 your interface's address to 10.0.0.2 (typically eth0), and netmask to
 255.0.0.0. 

</Para>


<Screen>

 # ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.2 up netmask 255.0.0.0
 # route add -net 10.0.0.0
 $ ping 10.0.0.1

</Screen>
 
<Para> 
 If everything is in working order, the router should respond to pings. How to
 configure this permanently will vary from distro to distro. So check your
 distribution's documentation. Now you should be able to ping the
 modem/router, and, if all is well, beyond. Then use telnet or a web browser
 to do any further configuration of the router.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Even if the ISP is not offering any router options, there are quite a few
 available from third party manufacturers such as Netgear, Linksys, Cisco,
 Zyxel, Cayman, Alcatel and others. These will have all the features already
 mentioned and maybe more. Just make sure it matches your provider's DSL. This
 is one good way around the PPPoX bugaboo.
 
</Para>

<Caution>
 <Para>
  Some manufacturers may be marketing these as having <Quote>firewall</Quote>
  capabilities. In some cases, this amounts to nothing more than basic NAT
  (Network Address Translation or masquerading). Not a full, true firewall by
  any means. Be sure to read the fine print before buying and make sure you
  know how much real firewalling is included.

<Title>Securing Your Connection</Title>

<Para>
 This section is intended for those who have not previously dealt with the
 security implications of having a full-time Internet connection. Or may not
 understand some of the basic concepts of security. This is meant to be just a
 quick overview, not a comprehensive examination of all the issues! Just
 enough to give you a quick push in the right direction. Please see the <Link
 LinkEnd="links">Links section</Link> for sites with more details. Also, your
 distribution surely has plenty of good information as well.

<Title>Security Quick-start</Title>

<Para>
 Before going on-line full-time, do not underestimate the need for securing
 your connection. You will have two things that mischief makers and crackers
 of the world are looking for: bandwidth, and a Unix-like OS. You instantly
 become an inviting target. It is just a matter of time before someone
 comes knocking. Possibly a very short time. A quick start:

    Turn off any daemons and services that aren't absolutely essential, and
    can be accessed from outside. You can't get compromised through a port
    that isn't open. Use <Command>ps</Command> and <Command>netstat</Command>
    to see what services are running. (See man pages for specifics). Do you
    really need <Command>named</Command>, <Command>sendmail</Command>,
    <Command>telnet</Command>, <Command>ftp</Command> running and accessible
    to one and all? If not sure, then they should not be running. Then take
    whatever steps necessary to make sure they don't start again on the next
    boot. See your distribution's documentation on this.
  
   </Para>
   
   <Para>
    Many distributions start some well known services by default. You may not
    have done anything yourself explicitly to start these. And may not even
    realize these are indeed running. But it is up to you to know what is
    running, and how safe it is. Don't rely on a <Quote>default</Quote>
    installation of any distribution to do this for you, or to be secure.
    Chances are it isn't.

    If you decide some services are essential, make sure you are running the

    Don't get caught with your pants down. A full-time connection makes
    staying updated very easy -- and very important. Check with your

<Sect2>
<Title>Which Ports?</Title>

<Para>
 There are plenty of references around on how to setup firewalls with
 <Command>ipfwadm</Command> or <Command>ipchains</Command>, but a little
 harder to find just which ports <Emphasis>really need</Emphasis> to be open.
 If you are not sure of the answer to this question, then the answer is 
 <Quote>as few as possible</Quote>! Basic rule #1, your computer cannot be
 broken into through a port that is not open. A port can't be open if nothing
 is listening on that port. In other words, if no service or daemon is running
 that uses that port, the port is closed and inaccessible.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 There are 65,536 ports available for use on Linux and these fall into
 several categories. The ones we are most concerned about are the
 <Quote>privileged</Quote> ports, which are those below port 1024. This is
 where most public services run, like SMTP on port 25, HTTP on port 80, named
 on port 53, etc. These services are where most vulnerabilities are on Linux.
 These are the ports that servers accept outside connections on. If you are
 running the <Command>telnetd</Command> daemon, it will <Quote>listen</Quote>
 for connections on port 23. (Actually if spawned by <Command>inetd</Command>,
 it may be <Command>inetd</Command> that is doing the listening.)
 
</Para>

<Para> 
 But, if you want to use a telnet <Emphasis>client</Emphasis> to
 connect to someone else's telnet server, you do not need to be running the
 <Command>telnetd</Command> daemon on your own system. You just need to start
 the client program named <Command>telnet</Command> (different animal). Same
 is true for ftp and other services. These daemons only need to be run for
 excepting connections to your system from an outside source.
</Para>

<Para>
 Unless you have a good reason for doing so, and know what you are doing, then
 you should not be running such publicly accessible services. In fact,
 you could probably survive quite nicely with all TCP and UDP ports below 1024
 closed down, or at least not visible to outside connections (i.e. blocked via
 a firewall). A couple of exceptions: 
</Para>

<Para>
 It is relatively safe, and in some cases alright, to run
 <Command>identd</Command> (port 113). Many mail and irc servers aren't happy
 without <Command>identd</Command> there. This is the one possible exception
 to the <Quote>nothing below 1024</Quote> rule of thumb. Newer versions are
 reasonably secure. 
</Para>

<Para>
 Mail is a little more complicated. The only reason to have a publicly
 accessible SMTP (port 25) server is if you are hosting your own mail server
 and receiving direct incoming mail connections. If you are retrieving mail
 via POP3 from your ISP, this port does not need to be open to the world. Such
 mail does not come in via port 25. It comes in through a higher, randomly
 assigned port. 

</Para>
 
<Para> 
 But -- it may still be convenient to have a mail daemon like sendmail, qmail,
 or postfix running to handle local mail delivery. In fact, this is a common
 default set up. You can get around this by firewalling off SMTP (port 25)
 from the outside world, or using another method to sort and deliver local
 mail. One way is to use procmail in conjunction with fetchmail:
 <Literal>fetchmail -m /usr/bin/procmail -d hal</Literal> will do this
 without having to run sendmail or other mail daemons in daemon mode. These
 programs are still capable of sending mail in non-daemon mode.

</Para>

<Para>
 It is probably safe to run a web server if you want to. Most vulnerabilities
 there are through CGI. Just keep the web server package updated.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 OK, enough exceptions. Shut down, or firewall off, <Emphasis>everything
 else</Emphasis> below port 1024.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Those ports above 1023 are known as <Quote>non-privileged</Quote> ports.
 These are mostly used for return connections that you have initiated to
 someone else's server. For instance, if you telnet to someone else, you
 connect to their port 23. The return data comes back to you on a randomly
 assigned port above 1023. These are mostly safe, and should as a rule be left
 alone. The only exceptions are where there are indeed services running on
 these ports. X Windows runs on ports 6000-6009 for instance. If you are
 running a font server, it may be on port 7100. Any servers running on these
 non-privileged ports, should be firewalled too.

<Sect2>
<Title>inetd</Title>

<Para>
 Let's take a quick look at <Command>inetd</Command>, since it starts many
 services. <Command>Inetd</Command> is a <Quote>super</Quote> daemon. It is
 called this because it controls the starting of other daemons. Telnet, ftp,
 rsh, identd and pop3 are some of the server daemons commonly controlled by
 <Command>inetd</Command>. You may not see <Command>telnetd</Command> running
 when you use <Command>ps</Command> or <Command>netstat</Command> unless
 <Command>inetd</Command> is configured to start <Command>telnetd</Command>,
 <Emphasis>and</Emphasis> someone is actually connected to
 <Command>telnetd</Command> at the time. So it may not be so obvious which of
 these servers can be accessed from outside. These sub-services are controlled
 by the configuration file <Filename>/etc/inetd.conf</FileName>. Open this
 with your favorite text editor, and put a <Quote>#</Quote> character in front
 of any service you don't want running. A brief excerpt:

<Title>Tuning</Title>

  <comment>Since there are no performance tweaks, why even mention
  it?
  
  Just so people know ... the question comes up.
  
  </comment>

<Para>
 There really are no tweaks, or performance tuning tricks that are likely to
 increase your performance to any significant degree -- all other things being
 equal. Windows 9x users often get a big boost by increasing their TCP Receive
 Window. But this is because it is too small to start with. This is not the
 case with Linux. 

</Para> 
 
<Para> 
 The only exception is if you have to routinely deal with a high latency
 connection. Such as maybe your provider has a satellite uplink that is
 consistently adding unusual latency (250ms or greater?). Then maybe a larger
 window will help. For the overwhelming majority of us, this is not necessary.
 For more on TCP Receive Window and related issues, look at <Ulink
 URL="http://www.psc.edu/networking/perf_tune.html">http://www.psc.edu/networking/perf_tune.html</Ulink>. 

</Para>

<Para>
 If your connection is not performing up to what you think it should be, then
 possibly there is a problem somewhere. This is more worth looking into than
 any magical <Quote>tweak</Quote>.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 A very rough guideline on what you might reasonably expect as a maximum sync 
 rate, based on distance from DSLAM/CO: 

</Para>

<LiteralLayout>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;0-12 K Ft - 2000 Kbps or more
  12-16 K Ft - 1500 Kbps -&gt; 1000 Kbps
  16-18 K Ft - 1200 Kbps -&gt;  512 Kbps
  18-?? K Ft - &nbsp;&nbsp;512 Kbps -&gt;  &nbsp;128 Kbps or less :(
</LiteralLayout>

<Para>
 You will loose 10-20% of the modem's attainable sync rate to networking
 overhead (TCP/IP, ATM, ethernet). So a 1500 Kbps connection, is only going to
 realize about 1100-1300 Kbps or so of real world throughput. No tweaking is
 going to change this protocol overhead. And remember that if your service is
 capped at a lesser speed by your provider, then you can't get above that
 speed no matter what. <Emphasis>AND</Emphasis> -- that there are numerous
 variables that can effect your loop/signal quality, and subsequently your
 speed. Many of these are out of your control.

    Is the modem Linux compatible? If ethernet interfaced, this should not be

    Call your provider and make sure the line was provisioned. It is always

    Disconnect the modem power cord and disconnect the DSL cord from the wall
    jack. Plug it into the test jack inside the NID (outside phone box), and
    run an extension cord if necessary for power. Temporarily disconnect the
    wiring to the inside phone circuit. This should effectively bypass any
    inside wiring and environmental issues. The ethernet cable to the NIC does
    not need to be connected to run this test (true only for ethernet modems).
    The modem will sync fine without it. (Easier said than done, I know.) But
    if possible, move enough of your system where you can view the modem's
    diagnostics (if available) and get the sync rate. If this works, there is
    probably something wired incorrectly inside, or a short in a connection
    somewhere, or there is severe electrical interference on the DSL line.
    Double check the splitter and wall jack connections. If a splitterless
    installation, look for bad wiring, bad (e.g. corroded) connections on

    If no sync on the above test, either the line was not readied, the

<Title>Sync Problems</Title>

<Para>
 Read this section if you have had a working connection, but now have lost
 sync, are intermittently losing sync, your sync rate has dropped
 significantly, or are getting a <Quote>sync/no surf</Quote> condition.
 (Better quality modems will have a way to report sync rate, usually via
 telnet or a web browser interface. See the owner's manual.) 
</Para>

<Para>
 A loss of sync indicates a problem with the DSLAM, your line (inside or
 outside) or your modem. DSLAMs typically have <Quote>shelves</Quote> with
 <Quote>cards</Quote>. Alcatel DSLAM cards, just for instance, have a capacity
 of four connections each. If the card goes bad, at most four customers are
 effected. The point being that sync loss outages can be very isolated. Unlike
 network outages that tend to effect large numbers of users. Sync outages are
 a telco problem, not an ISP problem. If your service agreement is with the
 ISP, you will need to contact them, who will in turn contact the telco.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Degraded sync rates, and disruption of the DSL signal, can cause various
 problems. Obviously, you will never get your maximum throughput under these
 conditions. But, the symptoms are not always obvious as to whether the
 problem is on your end or the provider's. 
 
</Para> 
 
<Para> 
 For instance, a poor inside wire connection may result in retransmissions of
 packets that have been dropped. This can really reduce throughput and slow a
 connection down. It is tempting to think of packet loss as a traditional
 networking problem, but with DSL it is possible to be the result of a bad
 line, impaired signal, or even the modem itself.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Some things to try:
 
 <ItemizedList>

 <ListItem> 
  <Para>
   Power cycle the modem. Turn off the power button/switch, and physically
   unplug the cable to the wall jack for 30 seconds or so. Turn back on, and
   re-attach to the wall jack. This will force a resync. Unfortunately, the only
   way to power down a PCI modem, is to reboot. This may fix a 
   <Quote>sync/no surf</Quote> condition that is caused by the modem, and
   maybe other conditions too. 
   
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 
 

  <ListItem> 
   <Para>
  
   See the <Link LinkEnd="nosync">above section</Link> on moving the modem
   lock, stock and barrel to the NID and thus bypassing all inside wiring.
   If the situation is improved there, then the problem is inside somewhere. If
   not, it is a telco problem.
 
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 


 <ListItem> 
  <Para>
   RFI Bear-hunt: The DSL signal is fragile, there are a number of
   things that can degrade it.  RFI, or Radio Frequency Interference,
   from sources in and around the home/office is one common source of
   reduced signal strength, and/or intermittent sync loss and/or low
   sync rates. Our test tool here is simply a portable AM radio. Tune
   it to any channel where you can get clear reception -- it makes no
   difference where. The AM radio will pick up RFI that is in the same
   frequency range as the DSL signal. It will sound like 
   <Quote>frying bacon</Quote> type static. Put it against your computer's
   power supply. You should hear some static. Move it away and the static
   should fade pretty quickly. This will give you an idea of what RFI sounds
   like. A decent quality power supply should produce only weak RFI --
   probably not enough to cause a problem. Use the radio like a Geiger counter
   and move it around your modem and DSL line. If you hear static, follow it
   to the source.  Things to be suspicious of: power supplies, transformers,
   ballasts, electric motors, dimmer switches, high intensity lighting. Moving
   the modem, or rerouting cables is sometimes enough. Keeping the line
   between the modem and the wall jack as short as possible is a good idea
   too.
 
   </Para>
  </ListItem>

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    Chronic sync problems are often due to a line problem somewhere.
    Sometimes it is something as simple as a bad splice, and easily remedied
    if it can be found. Most such conditions can be isolated by a good telco
    tech. Check with your provider, and politely harass them if you have to. If you
    get the run-around, ask to go over their heads.
   
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If you are near the distance limits of DSL, and having off and on sync
    problems, try the <Quote>Homerun</Quote> installation. See <Link
    LinkEnd="homerun">above</Link>. This can be effective in improving
    marginal signal/sync conditions.
   
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
     If using a surge protector, try it without the surge protector. Some may
     interfere with the DSL signal.
  
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

 </ItemizedList>
</Para>

<Para>
 Another possibility is a nearby AM radio station, or bandit ham radio
 operator that are disrupting the DSL signal since they operate in a similar 
 frequency range. These may only cause problems at certain times of day, like
 when the station boosts its signal at night. A good telco DSL tech may be
 able to help minimize the impact of this. YMMV.

<Sect2>
<Title>Network and Throughput Problems</Title>

<Para>
 Read this section if your connection is up, but are having throughput
 problems. In other words, your speed isn't what it should be based on your
 bit rate plan, and your distance from the CO. <Quote>Network</Quote> here is
 the WAN -- the ISP's gateway and local subnet/backbone, etc. Remember that a
 marginal line can cause a reduced sync rate, and this will impact throughput.
 See <Link LinkEnd="synctr">above</Link>.

</Para>

<Para>
 The two factors we will be looking for are <Quote>latency</Quote> and
 <Quote>packet loss</Quote>. Both are pretty easy to track down with the
 standard networking tools <Command>ping</Command> and
 <Command>traceroute</Command>. If either of these occur in our path, they
 will impact performance. Latency means <Quote>responsiveness</Quote> or
 <Quote>lag time</Quote>. Actually what we are interested in is abnormally
 high latency, since there is always some latency. Packet loss is when a
 packet of data gets dropped somewhere along the way. TCP/IP will know
 it's been <Quote>lost</Quote>, and there will be a retransmission of the lost
 data. Enough of this can really slow things down. Ideally packet loss should
 be 0%. 

</Para>

<Para>
 What we really need to be concerned about is that part of the WAN
 route that we routinely traverse. If you do a traceroute to several different
 sites, you will probably see that the first few <Quote>hops</Quote> tend to
 be the same. These are your ISP's local backbone, and your ISP's upstream
 provider's gateway. Any problem with any of this, and it will effect
 everywhere you go and everything you do. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 We can start looking for packet loss and latency by pinging two or three
 different sites, hopefully in at least a couple of different directions. We
 will be looking for packet loss and/or unusually high latency.

<Para>
 High packet loss at 35%, and some really slow roundtrip times in there as
 well. A little digging on this showed that it was a backbone router 13 hops 
 into the traceroute that was the problem. While making this site really slow
 from here, it would only effect those routes that happen to hit that same
 router. Now what would really hurt us is if something similar happens with a
 router that we tend to go through consistently. Like our gateway, or maybe
 the second hop router too. Find these with <Command>traceroute</Command>, by

 41% packet loss is very high, to the point where many services, like HTTP,

</Para>

<Para>
 It's a little tempting on this last real-life example to think this gateway
 router is acting up. But, as it turned out, this was the result of a problem
 in the DSLAM/ATM segment of the telco's network. So any first hop problem
 with packet loss or high latency, may actually be the result of something
 occurring before the first hop. We just don't have the tools to isolate
 where it is starting well enough. Packet loss can be a telco problem, just as
 much as an ISP/NSP problem.

</Para>

<Para>
 It is also quite possible for the modem itself to cause packet loss. The fix
 here is to power cycle the modem, and resync by unplugging the DSL connection
 for 30 seconds or so. In fact, any part of the connection can be a source of 
 packet loss -- modem, DSLAM, ATM network, etc.

<Sect2 id="throughput">
<Title>Measuring Throughput</Title>

<Para>
 No such thing as too fast, right? One of the first things most of us do is
 check our speeds to make sure we aren't getting short changed, and that our
 system is up to snuff. Doing this accurately is easier said than done
 however. First, remember you are losing 10-20% right off the top due to
 networking protocol overhead. Just how much is <Quote>lost</Quote> here
 depends on your provider's network architecture, where and how you are
 measuring this and other considerations. Most of us may wind up being closer
 to 20% than 10%.
 
</Para>

<Para> 
 Then, any time you hit the Internet, there is some slight degradation of
 performance with each hop you take. Now this may not amount to much, as long
 as you are not taking too many hops and all the components -- your system,
 your ISP's network, your ISP's upstream provider, and the destination itself
 -- are all working like well oiled machines. But there's the rub -- how do
 you really know with so many variables in the mix? One flaky interface, on
 one router, on one hop along the path, may cause misleading results.

</Para>

<Para>
 Your absolute max speed is going to be at your point of connection to your
 ISP -- the ISP's gateway. It can only go downhill from there, not up! So the
 ideal test is as close to home as possible. This eliminates as many unknown
 variables as possible. If your ISP has a local ftp server, this is an
 excellent place to run your own tests. (Run a traceroute though just to see
 how local it really is.) 
</Para> 
 
<Para> 
 If your ISP does not have this, look for an ftp site that is close -- the
 fewer the hops, the better. And look for one that isn't too busy, or you will
 get misleading results. Find a large file -- like 10 Megs -- and time the
 download. Try this over several days, and at different times of day. The
 server, and the backbone, are going to be busier at certain times of day,
 which can skew results and you want to eliminate these variables as much as
 possible. Your provider cannot compensate for heavy backbone traffic,
 backbone bottlenecks, slow or busy servers, etc. 

</Para>

<Para>
 There are many test sites scattered around the web. Some are better than
 others, but take these with a grain of salt. There are just too many
 variables for these tests to reliably give you an accurate snapshot of your
 connection and throughput. They may give you a general picture of whether you
 are in the ballpark of where you think you should be or not. One good speed
 test is <Ulink
 URL="http://www.dslreports.com/stest/0">http://www.dslreports.com/stest/0</Ulink>.
 Another test is <Ulink
 URL="http://speedtest.mybc.com/">http://speedtest.mybc.com/</Ulink> (both are
 java). I find these to be better than some of the others out there.

</Para>

<Para>
 Now keeping in mind that we are limited by the ~10-20% networking overhead rule,
 here is an example. My speed is capped at 1472 Kbps sync rate. Minus the ~15%
 is 1275 Kbps. My sync rate is known to be good and my distance to the CO is
 about 11,000 Ft, which is close enough that I should be able to hit my real
 world maximum throughput of 1275 Kbps or roughly 1.2-1.3 Mbps -- all other
 things being equal. From dslreports.com speed test:

 <Emphasis>Big Caution</Emphasis>: my ISP uses a caching proxy server for
 web pages. This is a big equalizer for these kinds of web based
 tests. Without that, I surely would have been significantly slower on this
 test. The effect of the proxy is that you are actually testing throughput
 from the proxy -- NOT the test site. Just FYI. Another note: at the same time
 I tried another test site and was consistently getting 600-700 Kbps. So YMMV
 with these tests. (Usually I get the same on each, more or less.) Timing a
 large ftp download from two different sites, I calculated about 1.25 Mbps.

<Title>Appendix: DSL Overview</Title>


<Para>
 DSL is a telephone loop technology that uses existing copper phones lines, 
 and provides a dedicated, high speed Internet connection. One of the big
 advantages of some DSLs (notably ADSL), are that they can co-exist on the
 same line with a traditional voice service or <Quote>POTS</Quote> (Plain Old
 Telephone Service). This is accomplished by utilizing different frequency
 ranges above the voice range (voice is up to 4KHz). Essentially, this gives
 two lines in one: one for POTS, and one for Internet connectivity. When all
 is working normally, there should be no interference between the two
 <Quote>lines</Quote>. This gives DSL a potentially broad consumer base, and
 helps minimize costs for 
 providers.

</Para>

<Para>
 DSL is positioned for the Home and Small Office (SOHO) market that is 
 looking for high speed Internet access at reasonable prices. Since it also
 typically provides dedicated, <Quote>always on</Quote> access, it can be used
 for interconnecting low to mid range bandwidth servers, and provides a great
 access solution for small LANs. It is also great for those Linux power users
 that just want a fast pipe  :-).

</Para>

<Para>
 Phone companies, and other independent telecommunications providers (CLECs),
 are now deploying DSL as fast as they can to stay ahead of the Cable
 companies -- the main consumer and SOHO competition for DSL providers. This
 mad rush to get <Quote>a piece of the pie</Quote>, is bringing much
 competition (a good thing!), much diversity, and some confusion, into the
 consumer market. The DSL provider (often, but not always, the phone company)
 will provide the DSL infrastructure. This would include your line, the DSLAM,
 and physical connection to the outside world. From there it is typically
 picked up by an ISP, who provides the traditional Internet services.
 
</Para>


<Para>
 Consumer DSL plans are typically <Quote>best effort</Quote> services. While
 boasting speeds approaching T1, and even surpassing that in some cases, it is
 not necessarily as reliable as T1 however. Business class DSL offers more
 reliability at a higher cost than consumer plans, and is a good compromise
 where both reliability and bandwidth are at a premium. All in all, the cost
 of DSL compared to traditional telco services, such as T1, is attractive and
 substantially more affordable for home and small business users.

</Para>
 
<Para>
 DSL providers often do not have service contracts for home users,
 while business class DSL services typically do include similar SLAs (Service
 Level Agreements) to that offered for a T1 line.

</Para>

<Para>
 The downside is that DSL is not available everywhere. Availability, and
 available bit rate (speed), are purely a function of where you live, where
 the telco has installed the prerequisite hardware, how far you are from the
 DSLAM/CO, and the quality of your phone line (loop). Not all loops are
 created equal, unfortunately. The primary limitation is distance.

 <Para>
   Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop currently supports downstream rates up
   to 8 Mbps, and upstream of 1024 Kbps, hence the <Quote>asymmetric</Quote>.
   The most widely deployed form of DSL at this time, and was specifically
   developed for the home and SOHO markets. The higher downstream rates lends
   itself to those not running serious servers -- at least anything more than
   a small, personal web site. ADSL is capable of sharing data with a POTS
   voice line, so an additional line is not required. A big selling point.
   ADSL, like other DSLs, is limited by distance. 18,000 ft (5.5 km) is a
   typical cut-off point for telcos. ADSL does typically require either a
   splitter or filters to isolate the DSL signal from POTS. Sometimes referred
   to as <Quote>full rate</Quote> ADSL in order to differentiate it from
   G.Lite DSL. There are two common line encodings for ADSL: DMT and CAP. DMT
   (a.k.a. Alcatel compatible) has won the standards battle and is now the
   more common of the two. Also, note that modems must be compatible with the
   encoding. In other words, a CAP modem will not work with a DMT service, and
   vice versa.

  <Para> 
   G.Lite is sometimes referred to as <Quote>DSL Lite</Quote>,
   <Quote>Universal DSL</Quote> or <Quote>splitterless ADSL</Quote>, is a
   slower version of ADSL that requires no splitters <Emphasis>or </Emphasis>
   filters. The isolation of voice and data signals is handled at the CO.
   Currently G.Lite supports speeds up to 1.5 Mbps/512 Kbps, and is expected
   to eventually become the dominant consumer DSL service. As of this writing,
   it is not as wide spread as <Quote>full rate</Quote> ADSL however.

  <Para> 
   Single-pair Digital Subscriber Loop, or also sometimes referred to
   as <Quote>Symmetric Digital Subscriber Loop</Quote> since it is indeed
   symmetric with a current maximum rate of 1.5 Mbps/1.5 Mbps. SDSL requires a
   dedicated line, and thus true SDSL is not as readily adaptable to the
   consumer market as ADSL. SDSL also uses a 2B1Q encoding (same as ISDN and
   some T1) which is considered more robust than the DMT or CAP encoding of
   ADSL. True SDSL is generally considered more of a server quality DSL. It is
   worth noting that some providers may be marketing a <Quote>SDSL</Quote>
   service that is really ADSL pinched so that upstream/downstream are the
   same. Wasn't all this confusing enough already?

   ISDN Digital Subscriber Loop, 144 Kbps/144 Kbps is really a new and
   improved ISDN from Lucent Technologies and uses the same 2B1Q line encoding
   as ISDN, SDSL and others. IDSL does require a dedicated line however. The
   benefits are that it is an <Quote>always on</Quote> technology, like other
   DSLs, and provides an additional 16 Kbps over traditional ISDN. It is being
   marketed by some DSL providers as a low end bit rate option, where line
   quality is not sufficient for higher speeds such as that of ADSL.

  <Para>
   Rate Adaptive Digital Subscriber Loop was developed by Westell and has a
   potential of 2.2 Mbps downstream and 1.0 Mbps upstream. What makes RADSL
   more flexible is that the sync rate can be dynamically adjusted up or down
   as line conditions change. This makes it more of a viable alternative where
   line conditions are marginal. In many respects, RADSL is an enhanced ADSL
   to meet a more diverse set of line conditions. Like ADSL, RADSL can
   piggyback on the POTS line.

<Title>The DSLAM</Title>

<Para>
 This technology is made possible by the placement of DSLAMs, or Digital
 Subscriber Loop Access Multiplexers, from such suppliers as <Ulink

 <Ulink

 in the telco's Central Office. DSLAMs come in various shapes and sizes, and
 are the one, single complex and costly component of a DSL connection. When
 a qualified phone line is connected to a modem at the user's end of the loop,
 a high speed digital connection is established, typically over ATM, or
 sometimes frame relay. The DSLAM splits the signal back into separate voice
 and data channels. The voice channel stays within the telco network, whereas
 the data is picked up by an ISP.

<Sect3>
<Title>Sync</Title>
 
<Para> 
 A good, working connection to the DSLAM is referred to as
 <Quote>syncing</Quote>. Without sync, nothing happens. The modem will
 establish a sync rate which is often throttled by the provider at a
 predefined limit. This limit, or <Quote>cap</Quote>, is at the provider's
 discretion and is part of the service that is being provided. Your modem may
 well sync at a higher rate than the <Quote>cap</Quote>, but your speed will
 be limited to whatever <Quote>cap</Quote> the provider is enforcing. So while
 ADSL has an upward theoretical limit of 8 Mbps, you will not see that speed
 -- unless of course your provider is selling an 8 Mbps plan. Most plans are
 well below this.

</Para>

<Para>
 Below is the status information from a SpeedStream 5660 modem/router via the
 built-in telnet interface. In this example, the customer is on a 1.5 Mbps/384
 Kbps service:

</Screen>

<Para>
 First notice the <Quote>Current Attainable Rate</Quote> in the
 <Quote>ATU-C</Quote> column. This is the downstream sync rate negotiated by
 the modem and DSLAM, which is over 3.5 Mbps. The actual speed is limited,
 however, to 1.5 Mbps/384 Kbps from the first row <Quote>TX Rate</Quote>. This
 is the theoretical limit of this connection. This limit, or
 <Quote>cap</Quote>, can be enforced at the DSLAM, as is the case the here, or
 further upstream. Had the first row <Quote>TX Rate</Quote> been lower than
 the provider's imposed limit, then this would indicate some kind of problem
 with the connection, perhaps due to distance or some kind of line impairment. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 The attainable sync rate is the result of a number of factors, including wire
 distance to the DSLAM, quality of both inside and outside wiring, the loop
 wire gauge and various other factors within the loop.  Actual measurable,
 real world throughput, on the other hand, is first of all dependent on sync
 rate. Low sync rate means low throughput. In the above example, had the sync
 rate been lower, say 500 Kbps, then that would be the maximum for that
 connection, even though the customer is paying for a 1.5 Mbps service.
</Para> 
 
<Para> 
 Secondarily, throughput will depend also on the ISP's network, and then the
 ISP's upstream provider.  You will lose approximately 10-20% of potential
 throughput to networking overhead. In the above example where the connection
 is throttled at 1.5 Mbps, the actual, real-world maximum throughput would be
 somewhere around 1.2-1.3 Mbps when overhead is taken into account. Moreover,
 once you hit the Internet proper, all bets are off as there are any number of
 factors that may impact throughput. A overloaded or busy server is likely to
 be slow no matter how fast your DSL connection is.

<Sect2 id="dslmodems">
<Title>DSL Modems</Title>

<Para>
 The modem is the last piece of the connection. The modem is connected
 directly to the DSLAM via the copper loop on the telco end, and plugs into a
 wall jack on your end. When all is well, the modem <Quote>syncs</Quote> with
 the DSLAM, and then makes an IP connection to the ISP, and off we go!

</Para>

<Para>
 For Linux users, <Emphasis>the modem is a very important
 consideration</Emphasis>! There are many modems supplied by ISPs that are not
 Linux compatible. Your best bet is an external, ethernet interfaced modem (or
 modem/router combo) that connects via a standard NIC, since most other modem
 options (PCI, USB, onboard) will not work due to a lack of drivers at this
 time! All ethernet based modems will work fine. (See the <Link
 LinkEnd="modems">Modems Section</Link> for an up-to-date list of compatible
 modems.)
 
</Para>

<Para> 
 With ethernet modems, the only potential compatibility issue is the Network
 Card (NIC). (And really any compatible ethernet NIC should do just fine --
 100 Mbps is not even necessary.) You are probably better off anyway, since PCI and
 USB modems tend to be more problem prone. If your chosen provider does not
 offer a compatible modem as an option, then you either need to look
 elsewhere, or you will have to buy one outright from a third party.

</Para>

<Para>
 As always, there are exceptions. <Ulink URL="http://www.xpeed.com">Xpeed</Ulink> 
 now has drivers for two PCI modems included with the kernel drivers (as of
 2.2.18). These are the first open source Linux DSL modem drivers, and is 
 welcomed news. Diamond makes an internal PCI modem
 which has binary-only drivers, but it is not in widespread
 use. <Ulink url="http://www.efficient.com">Efficient Networks</Ulink>
 is beta testing Linux drivers for their SpeedStream 3060 and 3061 PCI
 modems, and is expected to release them <quote>any day</quote>.  This
 will require a 2.4.x kernel, and a patch for the necessary ATM support. The
 initial version will have binary drivers only, but open sourced drivers are a
 future possibility. It is also possible to make a direct ATM connection using
 a modem plus an ATM card, though this delivery system is not used in the U.S.
 as far as I know, and should not be considered as a viable option. This would
 also require a 2.4 kernel.

</Para>

<Para>
 The most common type of modem in use today is actually a combination
 <Quote>bridge</Quote> and modem device. The bridge is a simple device,
 typically with little configuration.  Network traffic passes blindly across
 the bridge in either direction. Your point of exposure is the interface
 (typically a NIC) that is connected to the modem/bridge.  
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Some ISPs are also be offering <Quote>routers</Quote>. These are basically
 combination modem/routers that can handle NAT, and may have other feature
 enhancements such as port forwarding, a built in hub, etc. These are all
 external, so should work too. But probably not a big deal for Linux users,
 since Linux can do anything these do, and more. A locked down Linux box makes
 a most excellent firewall/gateway/proxy! 

</Para>

<Para>
 To confuse things even more, there are also all-in-one devices: combo
 bridge+router+modem, sometimes called <Quote>brouters</Quote>. In this case,
 the modem can be configured for either bridged or routed modes -- but it
 can't be both at the same time.

</Para>

<Para>
 All providers should make available a modem of some sort. Many ISPs will have
 more than one modem option. Some may give away the modem at no additional
 charge. Some may offer a free base model, and charge the difference for the
 better models with more features. Many of the modems that ISPs supply are not
 available through normal retail channels. Should you want to buy one
 yourself, this leaves used equipment outlets (e.g. ebay), or possibly buying
 a modem that your ISP may not support (i.e. a possibility of no tech support
 if you have a problem). 
</Para>

<Para>
 While some ISPs provide modems that are not readily available through normal
 retail channels, there are a number of manufacturers that are getting on the
 DSL modem bandwagon, and offering a good selection. Most have a
 number of enhancements. At this time Netgear, Linksys, Zyxel, Cisco, 3Com,
 and Cayman have products available. Depending on model and feature set,
 prices range from a little over $100 US to $800 and up. Many of these 
 handle their own authentication and encapsulation (DHCP, PPPoE, etc).
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Are some modems better than others? Short answer: no. Modems are not really a
 factor in speed. But some do have enhanced features, such as diagnostics or
 the combo modem/routers. Ethernet modems are generally considered the most
 reliable. Fewer IRQ hassles, no buggy drivers, etc. So the fact that Linux
 users are mostly relegated to ethernet modems is a blessing in disguise
 really. Are any of these better than others? Hard to say since most of this
 is so new there is not enough of a track record to compare brands and models
 with any degree of assurance. In other words, any old external, ethernet
 modem should do -- provided it matches your provider's DSL, and is configured
 for that service. 

<comment>I don't see the question "Are some modems better than
others?" being answered here.  The second sentence isn't very readable
to me, possibly just because of punctuation.

HB--attempt at cleanup.

HB -- Made it so. Thanks.
</comment>

<Warning>
 <Para>
 Make sure any third party modem or router you may purchase is compatible with
 your DSL provider. There are two major line encodings for ADSL (CAP and DMT
 a.k.a. Alcatel compatible), and several options for IP encapsulation. And
 different DSLs (SDSL, IDSL, etc) will require their own modems too. Your
 provider should have a list of compatible options. It may well have to be
 configured for your ISP's service too. Don't expect it to work right out of
 the box either (unless it does come from your provider). Many are accessible via
 telnet, or a web browser, where the configuration options are available. See
 the owner's manual for this.

<Title>The ISP Connection</Title>

<Para>
 The modem connects to the DSLAM, and then the DSLAM is connected to the
 telco's ATM network (or frame relay), where it is picked up by the ISP. The
 ISP will take over at what we <Quote>see</Quote> as the first hop on a
 <Command>traceroute</Command>.  Everything up to that point is in the hands
 of the telco/DSL provider. The ISP will connect to the ATM side of the DSLAM

 (155 Mbps). The important thing here is that an ISP must
 <Quote>subscribe</Quote> with your telco to provide this connection. The ISP

<Para>
 The Baby Bells (RBOCs) all own ISPs. These, of course, are

 themselves of the ILEC's DSL services, and in essence
 <Quote>reselling</Quote> the DSL services of the ILEC. While the underlying

Everyone has an ILEC, but these are not always a RBOC. A few rural areas still

</Para>

<Para>
 CLECs (independent telcos) are now installing their own DSLAMs. This
 makes them a direct competitor to the ILEC. In this scenario, there would be
 two (or more) DSL providers in the same CO, each with their own DSLAM(s), and
 each competing against each other. This complicates the ISP situation even
 further, as each DSL provider will be <Quote>partnered</Quote> with one or
 more ISPs. If you are lucky here, you will have many choices of plans and
 pricing structures.

</Para>

<Para>
 Typically, your service agreement is with the ISP, and not the DSL

 Before ordering service, check to see what providers there are in your area.
 Look for options on both the telco/DSL side and the ISP side. You may have

<Title>Qualifying</Title>

<Para>
 Once local availability is established, the next step is
 <Quote>qualifying</Quote> your loop. The provider will run various tests to
 make sure that your loop can handle the DSL signal. This is to determine how
 suitable your line is for DSL, and maybe what level of service will be
 available to you. You probably will have to order service just to find out
 this much. It can be a fairly involved process, with a variety of different
 tests being run. There are a number of things that may
 <Quote>disqualify</Quote> a line. The most common limitation is distance. 

</Para>

<Para> 
 All DSLs have distance limitations. ADSL is limited
 to a loop length of roughly 18,000 ft (5.5 km), but the actual cut off point
 will vary from provider to provider. The further away you are, the weaker the
 signal, and the potential for poor connections is greater. With ADSL, if you
 are within approximately 12,000 ft (3.7 km), you should be able to get at
 least 1.5 Mbps -- all other things being equal. IDSL has even greater reach,
 mainly because the maximum speed for IDSL is considerably lower at 144
 Kbps/144 Kbps.

</Para>

<Para>
 Still even if you're close enough, there are a number of potential
 impediments that may disqualify a line. Two such common impediments
 are load coils and bridge taps. These are aspects of the old telco
 infrastructure that once were deemed beneficial, but now are getting
 in the way of the newer, digital technologies.  <comment>This next
 sentence could stand rephrasing. HB - ??? sounds good to me?</comment>
 Whether you hit a snag like this or not, is pretty much hit or miss.  Fiber
 anywhere in the loop is also a disqualifier. The provider may take steps to
 <Quote>clean</Quote> the line. Just how far they are willing to go will vary
 from provider to provider, and this will likely add additional time to the
 installation process.

</Para>

<Para>
 Once the line is <Quote>qualified</Quote>, the next step is deciding on which
 plan is suitable for your situation.  The provider may have differing plans
 available depending on how strong a signal they think your line can handle.
 If you are marginal, you will not be qualified for the higher speed plans.
 And if price is a factor, having a tiered pricing structure is good also
 since the lower end plans are obviously less expensive. How this is
 structured also varies wildly from provider to provider. Since, DSL is a new
 service, and providers are trying to find the right price/feature
 combinations that will attract the most users and thus gain a competitive
 edge.

 and a near infinite number of other possibilities. The cost of different
 plans generally goes up with their speed.
</Para>

<Para>
 Should you be disqualified, and have other options, get a second opinion.
 Calculating the effective loop length is by no means an exact science. There
 is plenty of room for errors. Also, some providers may go to greater lengths
 to <Quote>clean</Quote> the loop than others. And, if you have more than one
 phone line, and are disqualified, then try the other line. Just because they
 both terminate at your location, does not necessarily mean they are the same
 length! The telco network is full of surprises.

 Should you have more than one choice, here are some things to keep in mind
 when comparing services from different providers. If you are in a populous
 area, chances are you do have a number of choices. There is a dizzying array
 of possibilities at this time. Remember too, that it is a two step
 connection: DSL provider and ISP. You may have choices for each.

<Para>
 Some Frequently Asked Questions about DSL and Linux.
</Para>

<Para>
<OrderedList>
 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. Does DSL work with Linux?
  </Para>

  <Para>
   DSL is a technology, or more correctly, a group of related technologies.
   This is akin to asking if Linux works with telephones. The technology
   itself does not care. So, the short answer is <Quote>Yes, of
   course!</Quote>. The long answer is that if there are any impediments, they
   are being imposed by the provider. There are things they may do, that can
   make getting Linux up and running, more of a challenge than it needs to be.
   Not having a compatible modem option available is one common gotcha. Also,
   if the telco or ISP is doing the installation, they may require a Windows
   or Mac system to be available. This saves them the costs of training their
   techs on various alternative OSes. Buyer beware!

  </Para>
   
  <Para>
   Basically all DSL does, is facilitate a high speed Internet connection. At
   some point, it is all TCP/IP, and Linux, of course, handles TCP/IP quite
   well.

  </Para>
   
 </ListItem> 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   Q. Where can I find drivers for my PCI (or USB) modem?
  </Para>

   <Para>
    As of this moment, you probably can't, because they are not available. You
    need an external, ethernet interfaced modem for all intents and purposes.
    If your provider does not offer one, you will have to find another
    provider, or buy your own modem outright. Just make sure it is compatible
    with your provider's flavor of DSL.
    
   </Para>

   <Para>
    The are exceptions to every rule. See the <Link LinkEnd="modems">Modems
    Section</Link> for a list of compatible modems as of this writing.
 
   </Para>
   
   <Para>
    If an incompatible modem puts you in a bind, hopefully you will take the
    time to politely harass the manufacturer  ;-).
    
   </Para>

   <Para>
    This situation may be changing. <Ulink
    URL="http://www.xpeed.com">Xpeed</Ulink> now has drivers included in the
    kernel for source for their PCI IDSL and SDSL modems. This is good news!
    <Ulink URL="http://www.efficient.com">Efficient Networks</Ulink> is in
    late Beta stages with their SpeedStream 3060/3061 PCI drivers. There is
    also a beta project for the Alcatel SpeedTouch USB (see the <Link
    LinkEnd="links">links section</Link>.) Hopefully others will follow suit.
    (Make sure you are reading the latest version of this document, as I have
    intentions of keeping this situation updated as needed.)
   
   </Para>

  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
     Q. How fast or good of a network card do I need?
   </Para>
  
    <Para>
     Any card that is compatible with Linux should work fine. Remember even
     low-end cards are 10 Mbps, and no consumer class DSL is near that at this
     time. I would suggest a reasonably good quality card, just to help
     eliminate the possibility of errors and premature failure.
     
    </Para>
  </ListItem> 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. How can I find out when DSL will be available in my area?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   Just where and when DSL gets deployed is totally in the hands of
   your friendly local telco. They obviously can't do everyone at
   once, so they probably are selecting areas based on competitive
   factors. Getting a straight answer from a telco on this question
   can also be a challenge.  Probably so as not to tip their hand to
   competitors. Unfortunately, it is a question only they can answer.
  </Para>

 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. I was disqualified because I am too far away. What can I do?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   Move? Seriously, there isn't much you can do. If there are other providers, 
   get another opinion. You never know. Determining the loop length is an
   inexact science, and there is room for errors. Many use databases for
   this, and these databases routinely have some inaccuracies. Some providers
   too, may be more aggressive in taking steps to help you out and clean up
   the line. Also, some providers offer low-end speed services that have
   greater reach. Maybe this will become available in your area. Or, the telco
   will install, at some point, remote devices for customers who are now too
   far away.
  
  </Para>

 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. What are the speed tweaks for Linux?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   There aren't any really. Linux is pre-tweaked, unlike some versions of
   Windows that really need some registry hacks to get optimum performance.
  
  </Para>

  <Para>
   Now if you are convinced you are not getting the performance you should
   based on your distance and line conditions, then maybe there is a problem
   somewhere. See the <Link LinkEnd="tuning">Troubleshooting</Link> section for
   more. What you need is a fix, more than a tweak.
   
  </Para>

 </ListItem>
 
 <ListItem>

     <comment>Perhaps make it clear that 640K is an example, or just
     use some "variable" instead of 640K. HB - OK.</comment>

  <Para>
    Q. My service is limited to 640K (for example). Can I get better speed by
    getting a faster modem? Any way around this?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   No, and no. The modem has little bearing on how fast your connection is for
   all intents and purposes. The provider has a mechanism in place for
   limiting your speed somewhere in the pipe before you hit the Internet.
   There is no way to defeat this.
  
  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   Q. I am paying for 768 Kbps service, and the best I ever get is 640 Kbps or
   so. Why? Is the service oversold? I am not getting what I pay for.
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   You will lose 10-20% of the rated capacity due to the overhead inherent 
   in the various protocols utilized. Most of us will probably fall closer to
   20%. This is just a fact of life for everybody. Just how much is lost here
   depends on a number of factors, and may vary from provider to provider. You
   seem to be close to your maximum when this is taken into consideration.
   Also, if you read the fine print, many ISPs are advertising speeds
   <Quote>up to</Quote> such and such. Check your service agreement and see if
   there are any guarantees. If there are, they may be well below the
   advertised maximum speed, and may be based on sync rate instead of actual
   throughput. Though this may vary from provider to provider. 
   
  </Para>

  <Para>
   Also, be careful how you test this. Some of the so-called test sites can be
   pretty unreliable. There can be many factors between you and that site that
   can impact your throughput and skew results -- not the least of which is
   how many people might be trying that same test at the same time. The best 
   test is via FTP download from a known good, close, not too busy site.

  </Para>
 </ListItem> 
 
 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. Why does PPPoX have such a bad rap?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
    The occasional disconnects is one of the biggest gripes. PPP is
    sensitive to any interruptions in the connection. Generally a disconnect
    means a new IP. And there are those that say PPP, by its very nature, was
    never meant to be an <Quote>always on</Quote> protocol. PPP is a session
    management protocol at heart, that requires a user to initiate a
    connection and authenticate him or herself. PPPoE/A are not yet
    particularly mature protocols either. They do not have much of a history
    or track record. Some would say the telcos and hardware manufacturers have
    rushed this out the door. PPPoE also requires an additional layer of
    software just to maintain the connection. This is one more layer of code
    and one more potential point of failure. Also, more system overhead is
    utilized to manage the connection.
    
   </Para>

 </ListItem>

 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. Why PPPoX? This seems like a bad idea!
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   PPP gives several advantages to the provider: they can use their existing
   infrastructure and hardware that they now use for their (larger) dialup
   customer base. It is easier to control user authentication and potential
   abuse situations, and easier to manage their network and related issues. In
   fact, it most boils down to its just easier for them. Easier, means saves
   man hours, and therefore saves costs (at least from their perspective).
  
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   It is not a conspiracy to conserve IP addresses, or thwart heavy users. IP
   address costs are insignificant in the overall scheme of things.
   
  </Para>

     <comment>In case you're not aware, it's illegal to sell or lease
     IP addresses.  Most ISPs get around this via a "service charge"
     associated with having multiple IPs. </comment>

 </ListItem>
 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. The only provider in my area does not support Linux. What can I do?
    Will I have to use Windows?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   NO! <Quote>Support</Quote> here is support as in <Quote>tech
   support</Quote>. They are just saying that they will not give you tech
   support when and if you have problems. This does not mean you cannot use
   Linux on their network. Just that you may have to fend for yourself when
   and if a problem does arise. Anything that is forbidden will be in their
   Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), or Terms of Service (TOS) agreement.
   
  </Para>

  <Para>
   I have heard stories where a new tech or installer has misinterpreted their
   own company's policy on this and told someone <Quote>you can't use Linux
   here</Quote>. Same with NT server. But this is almost always a misinformed
   individual.
 
  </Para>

  <Para>
   But -- if a provider does not support Linux, they may balk at installing
   onto a Linux box. Hopefully, they will have a self-install option to get
   around this annoyance. YMMV.
 
  </Para>

 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. My fax software does not work with my DSL modem. Why is that?
  
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
    Faxes are normally transmitted over typical analog phone lines by dialing 
    the fax machine on the other end. Analog modems can handle this, but 
    DSL modems have no dialing capability. Don't throw out that 56K yet!
    
  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. What does <Quote>FastPath</Quote> mean? Is it better? Faster? What is
    interleaving? How can I get better ping times?

  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   Interleaving is a feature of DMT line encoding. Essentially it is a form 
   of error correction that is configurable at the DSLAM. The side effects are
   a slower connection, especially higher latency. With FastPath (or sometimes 
   called non-interleaved) DMT, gateway pings can be in the 10-20 ms range. With 
   interleaving, this is more likely to be in the 40-75 ms range depending on 
   the degree of interleaving that has been enabled.
   
  </Para>

  <Para>
   On the positive side, a marginal line is more stable and less prone to
   errors with interleaving. Many telcos have interleaving on by default since
   increased stability would seem to be a good thing. But this is only
   beneficial for marginal lines, and everyone else is paying a latency tax
   for this. Some telcos may be amenable to turning this feature on/off. YMMV. 
  
  </Para>
 </ListItem>
 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. How fast and powerful of a computer do I need for DSL? My ISP says I
    need at least a Pentium 200.
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
    At the most basic level, a 386 will work fine. In most situations, you are
    connected to what is essentially an ethernet based network. So
    theoretically anything that can handle a very slow ethernet connection
    would work. No comment on well Netscape will run on a 386 though ;-) But as
    far as just managing the connection, a 386 is indeed workable. What else
    you can do with it, is another matter.
    
  </Para>

  <Para>
    Where this gets a little more complicated is the modem, and the client
    that the ISP may require. Any PCI or USB modem is going to require
    drivers, which means more CPU and system resources. Also, PPPoE does even
    more processing, so again the potential CPU load is increased. Windows
    tends to be not so efficient with all this going on, hence the requirement
    for mid range Pentiums by some ISPs.
    
  </Para>

  <Para>
   With Linux it will depend on what you are going to do. A low end Pentium
   should be fine for most uses. A 386/486 should do nicely for just a
   firewall/gateway box. Just remember if you are running PPPoE, you may take
   a performance hit on low end hardware. 
 
  </Para>
  
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. I just got my DSL installed, and my speed sucks, and/or my connection
    constantly drops. What is the problem?
  
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
    Not enough information to say, really. There are many, many things that
    can cause a poor connection. The list is too long to mention them all.
    
  </Para>
   
  <Para>
    One of DSL's weaknesses is that the signal can be fairly fragile. Many
    things can degrade the signal, making for poor connections, and thus
    speed. This can be caused by poor or substandard inside wiring, a wiring
    problem outside (like bad splice), RFI from any number of sources, AM
    radio signal interference from a nearby station, bridge taps on your
    line, excessive distance from the DSLAM and so on. Not to mention possible
    hardware problems with your modem, NIC, or the telco's DSLAM, etc. Not
    always easy to sort out.
 
  </Para>

  <Para>
   Your provider should be able to assist you. First, make sure the problem
   isn't with your setup as they likely won't help solve a Linux problem. Then
   be persistent, and don't hesitate to go over someone's head if the help is
   not forthcoming. Most problems are solvable. The trick is isolating it. A
   good telco tech, trained for DSL, can find all kinds of obscure wiring
   problems.

   card. See <Ulink

  <Para>
   Q: Why does DSL have all these bit rates (384/1.5/7.1M/20M/etc) options?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   A: The basic problem is the 100 year old design of the copper loop. It works
   great for analog phone, but it presents a real challenge for a digital
   signal. Remember that the distance of a loop is inversely proportional to the
   data rate that it can carry. Rate adaptive technologies are great for making
   a digital signal work in many situations, but it can't provide a consistent
   bandwidth for all applications, especially for very long (over 18,000 ft)
   loops. The different bandwidths that you see advertised reflect various
   marketing wars of vendors equipment, and the telco struggle to finalize on a
   standard set of data rates. The bottom line is for the telco to be able
   to reach as broad a customer base as possible.

  <Para>
    Q. Can I run a web server with my DSL connection?
  
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   Sure. You are connected to a TCP/IP network, so theoretically you can run 
   any service that the protocols allow -- mail, ftp, ssh, irc, etc. Where
   there may be problems, is with the ISP's TOS (Terms of Service). Some ISPs
   are pretty open on this, while others forbid any type of server, and may
   even block certain ports. You should research this, or ask the ISP before
   making any plans. Most ISPs that are selling a consumer service are not
   going to allow any high volume servers -- just personal, or low traffic
   services.

   If you do not have a static IP, you can get around this with one of the

     <comment>A consistent definition format is needed here.  I'd use
     a variablelist, but it doesn't really matter as long as you use
     the same format for all of the definitions.
     
      HB - This is a word for word holdover from the previous mini HOWTO. When
      I get time I'll look into re-doing this. I assumed some of this is 
      quoted, so I was reluctant to tinker. HB-FIXMELATER.

  <Para>
   Load coils: in-line inductances that improve voice-frequency transmission
   characteristics of a telephone circuit.  Essentially, a "load" steals energy
   from high frequencies and gives it to lower frequencies.  Typically only used
   in very long (&gt; 9,000 ft) phone lines.
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   By "bridges" I assume you mean "bridged taps".  In older neighborhoods, the
   phone wiring will have been used by more than one customer.  Perhaps these
   customers lived at different (though near-by) addresses.  The unconnected
   "spur" of wiring is a "bridged tab" on the currently connected circuit.
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   DLCs, Digital Loop Carriers: there's a bunch of systems for carrying more
   than one voice transmission on a single pair of wires.  You can shift the
   frequencies up or down, or you can digitize the voice transmissions and
   divide the telephone circuit by time or code or something.  The more
   general term is "pair gain".
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   These things cause different problems for high-frequency communications.
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   Load coils will completely mess up things by filtering high frequencies and
   passing low frequencies.  They probably also change the "delay envelope",
   allowing some frequencies to arrive before others.  One byte's tones will
   interfere with the next byte's.
  </Para>

     <comment>This next paragraph is Greek to me.  Well, maybe just
     Russian.  :-)  In any case, it's certainly geek...
     HB - Moi too ;)
     </comment>

  <Para>
   Bridged taps act as shunt capacitances if they're long in relation to the
   signals wavelength, and they'll actually act as band pass filters if they're
   about 1/4 wavelength of the signal.  That is, they'll pass particular
   frequencies freely.  Particular tones of a DMT modem might get shunted back,
   rather than passed along to the receiving modem, reducing bandwidth for that
   telephone line.
  </Para>
 
  <Para>
   Pair gain, digital or analog, limit the bandwidth available to one
   transmission in order to multiplex several on one wire.  High and low tones
   of a DMT transmission get filtered out by the apparatus.
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   The book "Subscriber Loop Signaling and Transmission Handbook", by Whitham D.
   Reeve, , IEEE Press 1992, ISBN 0-87942-274-2 covers the math of how to
   calculate the effect of line length, bridged tap, etc on the transmission
   characteristics of a telephone line.  It's pretty expensive, however.

   Q: Do you have examples of DSL Modems?
  </Para>
   
  <Para>
   A: Short Answer: Yes. Real Answer: The evolution of this technology is
   moving too rapidly for anyone to keep up to date in a HOWTO.  A good source
   of ADSL Modems is the ADSL Forum Home Page at <ULink

     <comment>Is this really as of June 1998? HB - Yes, apparently when the 
     original list was put together. I have left the old in mostly (not
     knowing how accurate this was), and just added to it per the 'update'.
     Presumably some of this older equipment is still in use. Whether still

<Sect3 id="cable">
<Title>Cable Modem vs DSL</Title>

<Para>
 The Telcos see DSL as a competitor to the Cable Company's Cable
 Modem, and as such, are providing competitive pricing and configuration
 offerings. Although Cable Modems are advertised as having 10-30Mbps potential 
 bandwidth, they use a shared transmission medium with many other users on the
 same line, and therefore performance varies, perhaps greatly, with the amount
 of traffic, time of day, and number of other users on the same node.  

</Para>

<Para>
 It is often heard that DSL has an advantage in that it is a private pipe to
 the Internet, with dedicated bandwidth. This is mostly a myth. You do have a
 private pipe to the DSLAM, but at that point, you enter the telco's ATM (or
 frame relay) network, and start sharing bandwidth. You are at the mercy of
 how well your DSL provider and ISP manage their networks. The consensus seems
 to be that DSL providers and ISPs are doing a better job of managing
 bandwidth than the Cable companies. It is easier for them to add and adjust
 bandwidth as needed to meet demand. You are less likely to have speed
 fluctuations due to other users being on line at the same time. But, again,
 this gets down to how well the network and bandwidth are managed.

</Para>


<Para>
 DSL probably has a small security advantage too. With most Cable modem
 networks, it is like being on a big LAN. You are sharing your connection (and
 bandwidth) right at the point of connection. But if you are not doing
 something to filter incoming connections already, you are asking for trouble
 either way. 
</Para>

<Para>
 There also seems to be a better chance of having ISP alternatives with DSL
 than Cable. Choice is a good thing, and so is competition. It seems most
 Cable outfits give you just one choice for an ISP. If you don't like it, you
 are out of luck. The number of options with DSL probably varies greatly by
 geographic areas. Populous areas, like Northeast U.S., seem to have many
 options. 
</Para>

<Para>
 So which is better? The differences aren't as much with the technology, as they
 are with the implementations. If you look around, you can find plenty of
 horror stories on either. And plenty of happy customers too. The way
 to know what may be the best for you, is to do comparative shopping based on
 experiences of other users in your area. Don't base your choice on one
 person's opinion. This is statistically invalid. Likewise, don't base your
 choice on someone's opinion who has had a particular service for only a short
 time. Again, statistically not worth much. Get as many opinions from those
 that are using the <Emphasis>exact same services</Emphasis> that you are
 looking at.

<Title>Fiber in the Loop (IFITL or FTTC, and FTTH)</Title>

<Para>
 In some areas, newer neighborhoods are being built with fiber optic cable
 instead of the traditional telco copper lines. While the fiber is a definite
 problem for DSL services, it has it's own potential advantages. Existing
 fiber is potentially capable of 100 Mbps, and it looks like this could easily
 go up soon. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 So while telco fiber customers are being shut out of the DSL market 
 (since DSL is a copper only technology), they may have much to look forward
 to. Technologies are under development, and in some cases just now being
 deployed, to take advantage of fiber telco phone loops. Known as
 <Quote>FTTC</Quote> (Fiber To The Curb), or <Quote>IFITL</Quote> (Integrated
 Fiber In The Loop), this technology is another high speed service that telcos
 can offer. The speeds are sufficient for VoD (Video on Demand) and VoDSL
 (Voice over DSL), and other high bandwidth services. One nice advantage here
 is, that since there is no DSL signal on the wire, the only required CPE is a
 network card. In other words, no modem -- just connect a NIC to the wall jack
 and off you go! This will also allow the telco to provide other digital
 services such digital TV. 

</Para>

<Para>
 FTTC is Fiber To The Curb. The last leg into the house is still copper. FTTH 
 (Fiber To The Home), on the other hand, is an all fiber loop with even higher
 potential.

<Title>Wireless</Title>

<Para>
 There is a lot of buzz about wireless technologies these days. Wireless would
 certainly seem to have a place in the broadband market, especially for areas
 that don't have ready access to cable or telco networks. There are still
 some inherent problems with the current state of this technology that may prevent
 it from becoming a major player in the near term however. Weather can still
 impact the wireless signal -- heavy cloud cover or rain for instance. Also,
 there is some pretty hefty latency if the uplink is via satellite. Surely
 these drawbacks will improve over time. But how soon?

<Title>Linux Friendly DSL ISPs</Title>

<Para>
By <Quote>friendly</Quote> we mean ISPs that don't put up any unnecessary
impediments just because you aren't running that other guy's OS. And yes,
there is some of that going around. If your choices are limited, and you are
forced to deal with one of these, then having a Windows box available
temporarily is one work around. Another, may be to sweet talk the installer
into letting you finish the installation (NIC, etc). Of course, self
installation, if available, should be completely <Quote>Linux
compatible</Quote>.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 So to make this list, the ISP/provider must make available some type of
 workable modem (ethernet interface at this point in time), nor should 
 penalize you, or make things difficult, just because you are running an
 alternate OS. Installing directly onto Linux should be an available option,
 and should not cause you any undue hardship. Technical support for Linux is a
 nice bonus, but not necessary to make the list. Please do not take these as
 recommendations, do your own homework. Also, this market is in a constant 
 state of flux, so use this as a starting point only!

<Title id="linrouter">Setting up Linux as a Router</Title>


<Para>
 Depending on your local setup, you should consider some other issues.  These
 include a firewall setup, and any associated configurations.  For my setup,
 shown in Figure 5 below, I use an old i486 machine configured as a
 firewall/router between the DSL connection and the rest of my home network.
 I use private IP addresses on my private LAN subnet, and have configured my
 router to provide IP Masquerading and Firewalling between the LAN and
 WAN connection. 

</Para> 

<Para>
 See the <Ulink
 URL="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/IP-Masquerade-HOWTO.html">IP
 Masquerade HOWTO</Ulink> , and <Ulink
 URL="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Firewall-HOWTO.html">Firewall
 HOWTO</Ulink> for more information.  For 2.4 kernels see the <Ulink
 URL="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO.html"
>Linux 2.4 Advanced Routing HOWTO</Ulink>. My experience is that Linux is more
 flexible and provides superior routing/firewalling performance. It is
 much less expensive than a commercial router -- if you find an old 486 machine
 that you may be using as a doorstop somewhere.

<Para>
 What I did is setup a Linux router (Redhat Linux 5.0  on a i486) with two
 ethernet interfaces. One interface routes to the ISP subnet/gateway (eth0 in
 above example), and the other interface (eth1 above) goes to a hub (or switch)
 and then connects the LAN with private network addresses (e.g. 192.168.1.x).
 Using the private network address behind your router/firewall allows some
 additional security because it is not directly addressable from outside. You
 have to explicitly masquerade your private addresses in order to connect to
 the Internet from the LAN. The LAN hosts will access the Internet via the
 second NIC (eth1) in the Linux router. Just set their gateway to the IP
 address of the second NIC, and assign them addresses on the same network.

</Para>

<Para>
 <Emphasis remap="bf">Caution</Emphasis> Make sure your kernel is complied
 with IP forwarding and the IP forwarding is turned on. You can check this
 with '<Command>cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</Command>'. The value is 
 <Quote>1</Quote> for on, and <Quote>0</Quote> for off.  You can change this
 value by echoing the desired value into this file:

</Para>

<Screen>

 # echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
 
</Screen>

<Para>
 You will also need to set up <Quote>IP Masquerading</Quote> on the Linux
 router. Depending on your kernel version, this is done with
 <Command>ipfwadm</Command> (2.0), <Command>ipchains</Command> (2.2), or
 <Command>iptables</Command> (2.4). See the documentation for specifics on
 each. AND -- do not forget to have that firewall set up too! 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 There are also several projects that are devoted specifically to using Linux
 as a router, just for this type of situation. These are all-in-one solutions,
 that include security and various other features. Installation and
 configuration, is reportedly very easy. And these will run on very minimal
 hardware -- like a floppy drive only.  The best known is <Ulink
