 Converted to DocBook 3.1 HB 08/08/00.
 This started as just some additions, but turned into major rewrite.

Todo:

LRP, etc.???

</Comment>

** Draft Comments *************************************************
Thu 08/31/00 08:00:27 PM
Broke off FAQ into separate page. More miscellaneous fine tuning.

Thu 08/31/00 12:12:29 AM
More minor cleanups. Added some DYN DNS links. Spellchecked.

Wed 08/30/00 06:24:59 PM
Added a bit of an intro to the 'Installation' section since the Overview
section is now in the appendix. Various and many small cleanups all over the
place. Added Faxing to FAQs. Changed all 15-20% network overhead references to
10-20. 
Added a 'Document Structure' section on main page per GregL's suggestion.
Committed to CVS at Wed 08/30/00 07:14:05 PM.

Wed 08/30/00 12:21:15 AM
Added several new links to the links section on VPN, PPTP and Netfilter. T-DSL
entry for glossary (German ADSL).
Moved DSL Overview to Appendix.
A few very minor cleanups, and most of GregL's suggestions.


*** Thu 08/03/00 06:59:50 PM EDT   *********************

Note to interested readers:

This is a work in progress. It is a fairly major rewrite of the original ADSL
mini HOWTO. Likely will be re-christened the DSL HOWTO (maybe mini, maybe not).
The first 3 or so sections are near ready IMO. I hope to have rough draft ready
by this Sunday or Monday. Would love feedback on any or all aspects of this
doc. I expect to submit to LDP by Aug 12 or so. Not spell checked yet. Check
back daily :)

Wow! We are missing that!

<Para>
 This document examines the DSL family of high speed Internet services now
 being deployed in various markets worldwide.  Information is included on the
 technology behind DSL as well as subscribing, installing, configuring, and
 troubleshooting, with an emphasis on how this impacts Linux users.  
 
</Para>

</Abstract>

</ArtHeader>

<!--   ~~~~~~~~       New Section Header    ~~~~~~~~~     -->

<Sect1 id="intro">
<Title>Introduction</Title>

<Para>
 DSL, or Digital Subscriber Loop, is a high-speed Internet access technology
 that uses a common copper telephone line (a.k.a. 'loop' in telco parlance).
 DSL provides a direct, dedicated connection to an ISP via the existing telco
 network.  DSL is designed to run on up to 80% of the telephones available in the 
 United States, and by using line-adaptive modulation, it is capable of 
 providing data speeds up to 8 Mbps.
</Para>

<Para>
 DSL services are now being aggressively marketed for home and small business
 use. DSL is typically priced below ISDN, and well below T1 service, yet can
 provide potentially even greater speeds than T1 without the
 cost/complexity/availability issues of T1. Since DSL is a dedicated, often
 'always on' service, it avoids the delays and use charges inherent with ISDN.
</Para>

<Para>
 The topics included in this HOWTO include qualification and pre-installation,
 installation, configuration, troubleshooting and securing a DSL connection. As
 well as other related topics. There are also appendices including a
 comprehensive <Link LinkEnd="overview">DSL Overview</Link>, <link
 linkend="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</link>, a listing of <link
 linkend="links">related links</link>, and a <link
 linkend="glossary">glossary</link>. </Para>

<Para>
 Due to the fast pace of change in the telco and DSL industries, please make
 sure you have the latest version of this document. The current official
 version can always be found at <Ulink

</Para>

<Sect2>
<Title>Document Structure</Title>

<Para>
 This document attempts to give a comprehensive discussion of DSL. All aspects 
 are hopefully addressed to one degree or another with what can be a complex
 topic since it deals with networking, hardware, new fangled technologies, and 
 various approaches taken by various vendors.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 To simplify the navigation of this document, below is a suggested reading 
 guideline. Everyone should read the Introduction. Please pay special
 attention to the <Link LinkEnd="usage">Terminology and Conventions</Link>
 section, as some of this terminology may be used somewhat differently in
 other contexts. Also, there is a <Link LinkEnd="glossary">Glossary</Link> if
 you get lost in the world of TA (telco acronyms) ;-).
 
</Para>

 <ItemizedList>

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If you don't know anything about DSL, you should probably read the entire 
    document, with the possible exception of the 'Tuning and Troubleshooting'
    section. You may want to start with the <Link LinkEnd="overview">DSL
    Overview</Link> section in the Appendix, and then the <Link
    LinkEnd="faq">FAQ</Link>. The DSL Overview explains how the various pieces
    of the puzzle fit together. DSL network implementations are more complex
    than traditional dialup networks. 
    
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If you have already done some homework, but have not ordered service from
    anyone yet, read the <Link LinkEnd="cproviders">Choosing
    Providers</Link> section, and the <Link LinkEnd="isps">Linux Friendly
    ISPs</Link> sections. Also, you might get a head start by reading the
    <Link LinkEnd="configure">Configuring Linux</Link> section so you know
    what lies ahead.

   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If you have ordered service already, and are awaiting delivery, you can
    skip the sections on choosing a Provider. If you will be doing a
    self-install, you should read the pertinent parts of the <Link
    LinkEnd="installation">Installation </Link> section, the <Link
    LinkEnd="configure">Configuring Linux</Link> section, and the <Link
    LinkEnd="secure">Securing Your Connection</Link> section.
   
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If the installation is complete, and you can't get a working connection, 
    skip right to the <Link LinkEnd="tuning">Troubleshooting</Link> Section. 
    If you are confused by what protocols are required, or what software you 
    need to have installed, also read the <Link
    LinkEnd="configure">Configuration</Link> section.

<Title>New Versions</Title>

<Para>
 Version .99 addresses some of the many changes that have occurred since the
 original ADSL mini HOWTO was published. Originally, ADSL was the primary DSL
 technology being deployed, but more and more some of the other DSL flavors are
 entering the picture -- IDSL, SDSL, G.Lite, and RADSL. Thus the renaming from
 'ADSL mini HOWTO' to the 'DSL HOWTO'. There have been many other changes in
 DSL technology as well. PPPoE/A encapsulation has become more and more common
 as many ISPs are jumping on this bandwagon. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 The contents have additionally been re-organized, with new sections added on

<comment>
You should decide on 1, one, location to list as the home of this HOWTO.

Would prefer the dynamic dns address. But, worry about the longevity of these
services. Is there such a thing as 'pre-release version' as an alternate?

<Sect2 id="usage">
<Title>Conventions, Usage and Terminology</Title>

<Para>
 For the sake of simplicity and sanity, let's clarify some of the terminology
 that we will be using in this document, so that we are all on the same page.
 While many of the definitions below are not always 100% technically correct,
 they are close enough for our purposes here. In fast moving technologies like
 DSL, there are so many 'ifs, ands, and buts' that it is difficult to say
 anything with any degree of certainty and have it stick. And there are
 exceptions to almost every rule. And sometimes exceptions to the exceptions.
 We will be dealing with generalities to a large degree here, please keep that
 in mind. 

</Para>

<Para>
 <ItemizedList>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   'DSL' will be used to refer to the entire family of DSL technologies now
   available  -- ADSL, SDSL, IDSL, RADSL, etc. ADSL seems to be the most
   common at this time, but the others are being deployed more and more. Where
   it is important to differentiate one type of DSL from another, the full
   proper name will be used: e.g. RADSL.  xDSL also is also commonly used to
   refer to the various DSL technologies as a group, but we will be using just 
   'DSL' here.

<comment>You should clearly state which you will use in this document, either
xDSL or DSL.  The last sentence can easily be extended... , but we will be
using DSL in this document or something similar.

10-4. HB.

  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   The term 'telco' here refers to any potential DSL provider. This includes
   the ILECs (Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers), a.k.a. the old guard phone
   companies. And CLECs (Competitive Local Exchange Carriers), or independent
   providers such as Covad and Rhythms. Both are providing DSL services over
   existing copper lines.

<comment> The last two sentences there need a bit of work, but I wasn't sure
what to do with them.  I'll take a look again later.

Chopped out one sentence, and minor re-wording (is that a word?). HB.

</comment>
  
  </Para>
 </ListItem>
 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   'CO' is the telco acronym for 'Central Office'. Traditionally this is a
   building where one end of your phone line physically terminates. The other
   end terminates at your home, office, or wherever. It will be used here to
   refer to the termination point NOT at your home, or office. regardless of
   whether it is a traditional Central Office building or another, smaller,
   remote structure or device.
  
  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   'Loop' is telco speak for 'phone line'. Essentially, you should think of
   your loop as one dedicated pair of copper wires that run uninterrupted from
   your residence or office directly to the CO. This is perhaps an
   oversimplification, but will serve our purposes. DSL availability, and
   signal quality, is tied directly to the characteristics of your physical
   line -- or 'loop' as they say.
   
  </Para>
 </ListItem>
 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   'DSLAM' is the sophisticated hardware device in the telco's CO to which the
   phone line physically connects, and thus makes DSL happen. Increasingly,
   telcos are making use of smaller devices like the 'mini-RAM' in remote
   locations. We'll use 'DSLAM' as a catchall for any device that enables
   DSL service from a telco.
   
  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   'Modem' will be used to refer to the end user device that enables a DSL
   connection to the DSLAM. 'Modem' is indeed the correct terminology since
   there is MOdulation and DEModulation of the signal. These modems typically
   have other features too. Some ISPs and manufacturers may be marketing
   simply 'routers', 'bridges', or even 'brouters' for this purpose. These are
   essentially DSL modems with some enhancements. A compatible 'modem' of some kind
   is the minimum hardware requirement at the customer's end of the
   connection. 

  </Para>

  <Para>
   Unless stated otherwise, we will also be assuming the 'modem' has an
   ethernet interface, and will connect to a standard NIC. For right now,
   arguably the only workable configuration is an ethernet interface. And
   perhaps is also the only viable option based on what delivery systems and
   hardware are now being offered by the overwhelming number of providers.
   This could be changing soon however.
 
  </Para>

  <Para>
   It is worth noting that 'routers' as supplied by DSL providers are
   typically modem-router combination devices. In our context, 'router' will
   refer to these devices as such. There are also SOHO routers available that
   are only dedicated routers and lack the modem functionality. 
 
  </Para>


 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   Previous versions of this document referred to the modem as an 'ANT' (ADSL
   Network Termination). While this may be technically correct terminology, it
   is not used by ISPs, manufacturers, telcos, or most users to any extent. 
   The 'modem' will be just called a modem, regardless of
   whatever other features it may have (i.e. router or bridge).

  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
  PPPoX will be used to refer to PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet) and PPPoA
  (PPP over ATM) collectively. These protocols are being used by many DSL
  providers now.

Added a brief new section here. HB.

</Comment>

<Para>
 Before actually ordering service, there are several things you may want to
 explore.
 
</Para>





<!--   ~~~~~       New Section      ~~~~~     -->
<Sect2>
<Title>Pre-Installation</Title>

<Para>
 Beyond the obvious consideration of price, there are many reasons to
 investigate which providers may be offering DSL services in your area. The
 large Telephone companies are everywhere, and may advertise the most. But
 increasingly smaller ISPs and independents are getting into the act. This is
 creating diversity in the DSL marketplace. A good thing of course, but
 possibly creating a little confusion too. 

</Para>

<Para>
 Not all DSL services are alike. Just because two local companies are offering 
 'ADSL', does not mean that necessarily there is much in common at all. In
 fact, there are potentially a number of factors that make one ADSL provider's
 service significantly different from another's. Some things to consider:
 
</Para>

<Para>
 <ItemizedList>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   Speed vs Price.
  </Para>
 </ListItem> 
 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>

   either case.
  </Para>
 </ListItem> 

 <ListItem>

  Quality of service. How is news, mail, etc.?

<Para>
 For a more lengthy discussion on some of these considerations and related
 issues, see the <Link LinkEnd="overview">DSL Overview</Link> appendix for
 more on <Link LinkEnd="dslmodems">modems</Link>, 
 <Link LinkEnd="qualify">qualifying for service</Link>, and 
 <Link LinkEnd="cproviders">choosing a provider</Link>.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Once you have chosen a provider, and ordered service, the next step is for
 the telco to 'qualify' your loop. This essentially means testing your line to
 make sure it can handle the DSL signal, and possibly what level of service
 may be available to you. This may take some time, especially if the telco 
 encounters problems with the loop. If no problems are found during this
 phase, then possibly there will be a two to three week wait for the installation.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 After the telco has qualified the loop and readied their end of the
 connection, the next step is installation of the necessary components at the
 customer's end of the connection: wiring modifications, splitter or filters,
 and, of course the modem and any necessary software.

<!--   ~~~~~       New Section      ~~~~~     -->

<Sect2>
<Title>Installation Options -- Self Install or Not</Title>

<Para>
 You may or may not have a choice on how the installation is done, or who
 does it. This is totally at the discretion of the provider. Many providers
 offer a 'self install' option where you do all the work. In this scenario,
 the provider will send a kit in order to save them from sending a tech, and
 thus reducing cost. Typically, self install kits will include microfilters
 for the POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) phone jacks, the modem (and maybe
 a NIC), and a CDROM with drivers, etc. on it. In some cases, a splitter may
 be included instead of microfilters. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 The other possibility is for the provider to do the installation. Obviously,
 the cost is higher here, but it may have the advantage of having a trained
 tech do any wiring. There is also a better chance of getting a splittered
 installation with this option. Another benefit is that if something is wrong
 with the line, or the telco has not provisioned the line properly, an on-site
 tech may be able to help sort out some kinds of problems.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 The self-install kit should come with full instructions, regardless of whether
 the installation will be splittered or filtered. So we won't go into much
 detail on this aspect.
 
</Para>

</Sect2>

<!--  ~  End Section  ~  -->




<!--   ~~~~~       New Section      ~~~~~     -->

<Sect2>
<Title>Wiring/Installation Options</Title>

<Para>
 There are various wiring schemes depending on how your service is being
 provided, who is providing it, and which DSL service is being provided.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 <ItemizedList>
  
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    <Emphasis>Dedicated Line</Emphasis>. Some DSLs require a dedicated wire
    pair, e.g. IDSL. This means a separate line for DSL and Internet
    connectivity. Also, DSL services from CLECs (like Covad or Rhythms),
    will use a dedicated line since the ILEC will not share one line with
    another company. (Instead the CLEC will actually lease a loop from the
    ILEC.) One your end, this simply means using one of the unused wire pairs
    in the telco wire bundle, and connecting it to the DSL jack.
   
   </Para>
 </ListItem> 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <Emphasis>Shared Line with Splitter</Emphasis>. For DSLs, like ADSL, that
   are provided over the same line as regular voice service (POTS), the signal
   must be filtered somehow so that voice services are not adversely effected.
   Installing a splitter splits the line into two pairs, and filters the DSL
   signal from one of them. This results in a inside wiring scheme where DSL
   goes to only one jack, and then POTS service to all other jacks. This is
   considered by many to be a better type of installation than 'splitterless'. 
  
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   Splitters are available from various manufacturers and come in various
   shapes and sizes. Some are small enough to fit in the NID itself, while
   others have a housing as large as the NID itself. Typically this is
   mounted near the NID, on the customer's side of the demarcation point.
 
  </Para>
 
 </ListItem> 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <Emphasis>Shared Line with Filters</Emphasis>. Again, for DSLs that
   piggyback on the POTS line, the signal must be filtered or split at some
   point. The other way of doing this is by placing RJ11 'microfilters' in
   each phone jack -- <Emphasis>except where the DSL modem will be</Emphasis>.
   These filters are relatively small, plug-in devices and remove the higher
   frequencies associated with DSL. This is obviously much easier since no
   tools or wiring is required. This is often what is included in self-install
   kits, and is often referred to as a 'splitterless' installation.

<Title>Self Install - Wiring</Title>

<Para>
 If you are not doing the self-install option, then you may skip this section
 and move to <Link LinkEnd="configure">Configuring Linux</Link>. The following
 procedures are meant to illustrate the wiring process. Please note that your
 procedures may be different at your location.  Make sure you follow any
 warnings or safety instructions provided, that you RTFM, and that you are
 familiar with telco wiring procedures.
</Para>

<Para>
 Be aware that typical telco wire has more than one pair per bundle. Often,
 two pairs, but sometimes more. If you have but one phone line, the other
 pair(s) are unused. This makes them available for use with wiring for DSL.
 Wire pairs are color coded for easy identification. SDSL and IDSL require a
 dedicated, or 'dry', pair. If an unused pair is available, then no real
 re-wiring is required. It is just a matter of re-wiring an existing jack for
 the correct pair of wires, and attaching the modem.

</Para>

<Para>
 The first step will be to wire up the connections from your provider. Identify
 the line on which service will be installed, and the locations of your
 splitter and DSL jack(s). (For perhaps a better wiring scheme, see the 
 Homerun section immediately below.)

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A retired Bellsouth ADSL installer. 

</Para>

<Para>
 Perhaps a somewhat better method of wiring for the DSL modem is sometimes
 called a 'homerun'. It is called this because it is one, straight shot from
 the splitter to the modem's DSL jack. What this does is bypass the existing
 inside wiring altogether, and any problems that might be lurking there --
 like a corroded connection somewhere on a POTS jack. Inside wiring defects
 can be a source of headaches, especially in older homes. 
</Para> 
 
<Para> 
 It also allows you to route the cable to avoid any potential RFI (Radio
 Frequency Interference) sources. RFI anywhere in the circuit can be a DSL
 killer. So routing the cable away from items that may have electric motors,
 transformers, power supplies, high intensity lighting fixtures, dimmer
 switches and such, is a smart way to go. And you are less likely to have a
 failing microfilter cause problems. You can also use a better grade of cable
 such as CAT 5 or shielded twisted pair wire.

</Para>

<Para>
 If you are splitterless (i.e. using microfilters) now, this will entail
 purchasing a splitter, and, of course, some rewiring. Microfilters also add
 distance to the effective loop length -- as much as 700 ft per filter in some
 cases! So if you have several of these, and your sync rate or distance is
 marginal, eliminating the filters may result in a significant improvement.

<Title>Wire the Splitter</Title>

<Para>
 If you have the splitterless design or a dedicated line, you may skip this part.
</Para>

<Para>
 The splitter will consist of two parts, the splitter and a small outdoor
 housing.  Mount the splitter and accompanying housing per the telco's
 instructions at the Subscriber Network Interface (SNI) point (sometimes
 called the NID or ONI), usually the side of your house where the phone line
 is located. Put it on your side of the SNI or NID. The phone company may
 need to access the splitter for maintenance, so its advisable to locate it on
 the outside where they can get at it, but outside is not absolutely necessary.
 The wire bundle should have at least two separate wire pairs. The splitter
 takes one pair, and separates the signal onto two pairs. One pair in the
 bundle will then go to all POTS jacks, and the other to the modem's DSL wall
 jack. So connect the incoming telco line to the LINE side of the splitter.
 Then wire the inside pair for your telephone to the VOICE, and your inside
 wire pair for the modem to DATA. 

</Para>


<Para>
 <Emphasis remap="bf">Checkstep </Emphasis> At this point, you should be able
 to pull dial tone off the voice side of the splitter. If this doesn't work,
 then either you've wired it wrong, or the DSL service is not yet connected
 on the telco side. You could also plug the modem into the test jack in the
 SNI/NID box (most should have this). Plug in the modem's power cord, and if
 the line is provisioned correctly, you should 'sync' in less than a minute.
 This test only requires the modem.  (Internal and USB modems probably will
 require a driver to be loaded before syncing. This means having the computer
 there too.)

 Wire the DSL wall jack (RJ11) at your computer location, which should already

 situation, but basically you will have a wire pair that you will connect to
 the DSL jack. Make sure you <Emphasis>read the directions</Emphasis>, as the
 DSL-RJ11 wiring is different for phones and DSL jacks.

<Title>Installing and Testing the Modem</Title>

<Para>
 To install, connect the modem's (or modem/router's) power cord, and connect
 the phone line between the DSL wall jack and the modem. This cable should be
 provided. If not, a regular phone cord will suffice. With the ethernet
 interfaced modems, you may also connect the ethernet cable between the NIC
 and the modem (but not really necessary at this point just to verify the
 modem is working).

</Para>

<Para>
 <Emphasis remap="bf">Checkstep </Emphasis> At this point, verify the modem
 syncs with the telco's DSLAM signal. Most modems have a green LED that
 lights up when the signal is good, and red or orange if not in sync. The
 modem's manual will have more details on the LEDs. If it doesn't sync, then
 check your wiring, or make sure that the DSL signal is being sent. Do this by
 calling your telco and verifying they have activated the service. Or by
 testing the modem at the test jack on the SNI/NID (see above). Note that
 having dial tone on the line does NOT confirm the presence of the DSL data
 signal. And vice versa -- perfectly possible to have dial tone and no DSL, or
 DSL and no Dalton.

<Title>Bridged vs PPPoX Networks</Title>

<Para>
 Before we get too far into the final stages of installing and configuring our
 system, let's look at how various DSL ISPs set up their networks. It will be
 very important for you know how your ISP does this, as there is more than one
 possibility and the steps involved are quite different for each. This may not
 be the kind of thing the ISP is advertising, and since you are not using
 Windows, you may not have access to the setup disk that the ISP provides. If
 not sure, ask the ISP's tech support staff, or other users. 

</Para>

<Para>
 To muddy the waters even more, some ISPs may be offering more than one kind
 of service (over and above the various bit rate plans). Example: Bell
 Atlantic originally offered static IPs with a Bridged connection. Now all new
 installs use PPPoE with dynamic IPs. For installation and configuration
 purposes, this is very different.

</Para>

<Para>
 The two most common DSL network implementations are Bridged/DHCP and PPPoX.
 Both have mechanisms for obtaining an IP address and other related networking
 configuration details so we shouldn't have to worry about this. Our job will
 be finding the right client, and doing what we have to, to get it up and
 running.
 
</Para>


<Para>
 <Emphasis>Important!</Emphasis> You need to know beforehand how your ISP is
 setup for connecting to his network. To re-iterate, the two main
 possibilities are Bridged/DHCP and PPPoE. These are mutually exclusive
 implementations. So you will need either one or the other, and it must be the
 right one or you will waste a lot of time and effort. You cannot choose which
 one either. It is a matter of how the ISP is doing his network. Note that
 PPPoE can run over Bridged networks, so just knowing whether you are Bridged
 or not, is not necessarily good enough. PPPoA is yet another alternative. If
 your provider is giving you a router, there is a good chance that the
 router's firmware will handle all of this for you. 
 
</Para>




<!--   ~~~~~       New Section      ~~~~~     -->
<Sect3>
<Title>Bridged/DHCP</Title>

<Para>
 In the good old days of a year or two ago, 'Bridged' connections were the 
 norm. This type of network puts you on a local subnet just like a big
 LAN. You are exposed to much of the local subnet traffic, especially ARP and
 broadcast traffic. The typical means of authenticating in this set up, is via
 DHCP. 
</Para

<Para>
 DHCP is a standard, established networking protocol for obtaining an IP
 address and other important network parameters (e.g.  nameservers). This is a
 very standard, well documented networking scheme and is very easy to set up
 from the end user's perspective. It is also a very stable connection. You
 can actually unplug the modem for say 10 minutes, plug it back in, let it
 re-sync, and the connection is still there -- same IP and everything. 

</Para>

</Sect3>

<!--  ~  End Section  ~  -->



<!--   ~~~~~       New Section      ~~~~~     -->

<Sect3>
<Title>PPPoX</Title>

<Para>
 The main alternative now is PPPoX, meaning either PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet)
 or PPPoA (PPP over ATM). Both of these related protocols are currently being
 deployed, but at the moment, PPPoE seems to be the more common of the two.
 PPPoX is a relative newcomer, and, as the name implies, is a variation of
 Point-to-Point Protocol that has been adapted specifically for DSL providers.
</Para>

<Para>
 There are several PPPoE clients for Linux (<Link LinkEnd="pppoe">see
 below</Link>). At this moment, PPPoA support is in beta, but should be
 available very soon. PPPoX simulates a dialup type environment. The user is
 authenticated by user id and password which is passed to a RADIUS server,
 just like good ol' dialup PPP. A routable IP address, and other related
 information, is returned to the client. Of course, no actual dialing takes
 place. The mechanics of how this is handled, will vary from client to client,
 so best to RTFM closely. Typically you will set up configuration files like
 <Filename>pap-secrets</FileName>, etc.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 From the ISPs perspective, PPP is much easier to maintain and troubleshoot.
 From the end user's perspective, it is more work to set up, and the
 connection is maybe not as stable. So anyway, this seems to be the coming
 trend. Many of the large telcos, especially the RBOCs (Baby Bells), have
 committed to PPPoX already. Setting up a PPPoX connection is completely
 different from setting up a bridged/DHCP connection.

<!--   ~~~~~       New Section      ~~~~~     -->

<Sect3>
<Title>ATM</Title>

<Para>
 Since the traffic on the wire from the DSLAM to the modem is ATM, a raw ATM 
 connection would seem to make sense. While possible, this is rare, if
 implemented at all, in the U.S, and would require a modem in addition to a
 PCI ATM card, such as the Efficient Networks 3010. There is an ATM project
 for Linux, that is being incorporated into the 2.4 kernel. (See the <Link
 LinkEnd="links">Links section</Link> for more.)

<Title>Configuring the WAN Interface</Title>

<Para>
 The most common configuration is a DSL modem in 'bridging' mode. Both PPPoE
 and DHCP can use this setup. In this scenario, the WAN interface typically
 means your NIC. This is where your system meets the outside world. (If you
 have a router see <Link LinkEnd="router">below</Link> for router specific
 instructions.) So essentially we will be configuring the NIC, typically
 'eth0' since it is an ethernet interface. 
</Para> 
 
<Para>
 With PPPoX, once the connection comes up, there will be a 'ppp0' interface,
 just like dialup. This will become the WAN interface, but for configuration
 purposes we will we still be concerned with 'eth0' initially.

<Title>Static IP Configuration</Title>

<Para>
 A 'static' IP address is an IP that is guaranteed not to change. This is the
 preferred way to go for those wanting to host a domain or run some type of
 public server, but is not available from all ISPs. Skip this section if you
 do not have a static IP, or if you have a router, and the router will be 
 assigned the static IP.

</Para>

<Para>
 Configure the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server
 information as provided by the ISP. Each Linux Distribution (Redhat, Debian,
 Slackware, SuSE, etc.) has a different way of doing this, so check on your
 distro's docs on this. Each may have their own tools for this. Redhat has
 <Command>netcfg</Command> for instance. You can also do this manually using
 the <Command>ifconfig </Command> and <Command>route</Command> commands. See
 the man pages on these or the  <Ulink

<Sect3>
<Title>Bridged/DHCP Configuration</Title>

<Para>
 ISPs that have Bridged networks typically use DHCP to assign an IP addresses,
 and authenticate the user. All distributions come with one or more DHCP
 clients. <Command>dhcpcd</Command> seems to be the most common.
 <Command>pump</Command> comes with Redhat based distributions as of Redhat
 6.0. The DHCP client will obtain an IP 'lease' from the ISP's server as well as
 other related information: gateway address, DNS servers, and network mask.
 The lease will be 'renewed' at regular intervals according to the ISP's
 configuration. 

</Para>

<Para>
 You will want the DHCP client started on boot, so use your distribution's
 means of doing this. There generally is little to configure with DHCP as it
 is fairly straightforward and easy to use. You may need to tell it which
 interface to listen on if the NIC is something other than 'eth0'. You can
 also start it from the command line to get started. See the respective man
 pages for more. 
  
</Para>

<Para>
 Unless you have a static IP, the ISP will need some way to know who you are
 when you connect. There are two ways this authentication process is
 accomplished with DHCP. The first and most common method is via the MAC (or
 hardware) address of the network device. Typically this would be the NIC. The
 MAC address is a unique identifier and can be found among the boot messages,
 or with <Command>ifconfig</Command>, and looks something like 
 <Literal>00:50:04:C2:19:BC</Literal>.  You will need to give the ISP the MAC
 address before your first connection. 
</Para> 
 
<Para> 
 The other DHCP authentication method is via
 an assigned hostname. In this case, the ISP will have provided you with this
 information. Your DHCP client will need to pass this information to the
 server in order for you to connect. See the client's man page, or your
 distribution's documentation, for specifics.

</Para>

<Para>
 <Emphasis>Caution!</Emphasis> If your ISP uses MAC address authentication,
 and you change your network device (i.e. NIC), you will need to register the
 new address with the ISP or you won't be able to connect.

 PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet) is an alternate way for ISPs to control your
 connection, and is becoming increasingly popular with ISPs. Setting this up
 is quite different, and may be a little more work than with static IPs or
 DHCP above. Some distros are now shipping PPPoE clients. If this is not the
 case for you, then you will have to download one. Check any Linux archive

<Title>PPPoA</Title>

<Para>
 PPPoA (PPP over ATM) is a cleaner solution than PPPoE since most of the work
 is done in hardware, and since the raw DSL traffic is ATM. There is no client
 necessary to manage the connection as with PPPoE. Authentication is still the
 same: user id and password to connect, but the mechanics are different since
 no ethernet encapsulation takes place.

</Para>

<Para>
 As of this moment, there is not really a viable, working implementation of
 PPPoA for Linux. There is an ATM patch for 2.2 kernels, support for ATM in
 the 2.4.x kernel, and a project based on the Efficient Networks 3010
 [possibly out of production], as well as other ATM cards. The ATM on Linux
 homepage is here: <Ulink URL="http://lrcwww.epfl.ch/linux-atm/">

 URL="http://www.sfgoth.com/~mitch/linux/atm/pppoatm/">
 http://www.sfgoth.com/~mitch/linux/atm/pppoatm/</Ulink> from the kernel
 developer of this project. Existing PPPoA implementations are hardware/driver
 based, and Linux PPPoA modem drivers are scarce as hen's teeth at this time.
 The above modem does not seem to be available through normal retail channels.
 This may well be a problem, if this is the only protocol an ISP delivers. At
 the very least, some rather serious hoop jumping is in order. 

</Para>

 <Emphasis>Note:</Emphasis> There is apparently a PPPoA beta program underway
 based on the Efficient Networks SpeedStream 3060/3061 (PCI, DMT). Efficient is

 source may follow. This is a big improvement!

<Sect3 id="router">
<Title>Modem/Router Configuration</Title>

<Para>
 Some ISPs are providing 'routers' as the connection device. Essentially these
 are mini routers with built in modems. These are all ethernet based devices
 too, so Linux should be good to go here as well. Again, a compatible NIC
 should be all that is required to make this work.

</Para>
 
<Para> 
 A 'router' has many advantages. The better ones can handle the connection
 management, IP encapsulation, and authentication, as well as providing a
 means of segregating your LAN from outside traffic, and possibly other
 features too. In short they can do it all. One big advantage is that they can
 handle whatever protocols your ISP requires in order to connect. If the ISP
 is requiring PPPoX, then this makes life a little easier since you will not
 have to install or configure any additional software just to use their
 network. The downside is that most of these do not have the flexibility of a
 Linux router, or other software solution. The ones with more and better
 features are also going to cost significantly more. 

</Para>

<Para>
 While the physical installation of a router is very similar to the modem
 installation (see above), the router configuration itself is different
 since your first 'hop' will be the router's interface and not the ISP's
 gateway. Routers will actually have two interfaces -- one that you
 connect to from the LAN side, and one that connects to your ISP on the WAN
 side. Your point of exposure here is the WAN interface of the router. 
</Para>

<Para> 
 The router will also have a pre-configured, private IP address that you will
 connect to from the LAN side. This will be your gateway. The public IP
 address will be assigned to the WAN side interface. Typically these devices
 also act as DHCP servers for the LAN side as well. So possibly all you have
 to do is to start a DHCP client such as <Command>dhcpcd </Command>or
 <Command>pump </Command> (Redhat based distros) to get up and running. Just
 make sure the modem/router is syncing first. The appropriate steps and
 configuration should be in the owner's manual, or available from your
 provider. 

</Para>

<Para>
 If you are a PPPoX customer, and the router is handling this part of the
 connection, then you will have to configure at least your user id and
 password before connecting. If a Bridged/DHCP customer, you should just have
 to activate DHCP on the router, and possibly register the MAC (hardware
 address) of the router with your provider. Some routers have 'MAC cloning'
 which means that they will report the MAC address of the attached NIC. If
 static IP, then you will have to configure this as well.

</Para>

<Para>
 If you need to access the router directly, you will need to know the
 manufacturer's default setting for its IP address. See the owner's manual, or
 ask your provider. You will then have to set your NIC's interface to the same
 network as the router. For instance, if the router has an IP of 10.0.0.1, set
 your interface's address to 10.0.0.2 (typically eth0), and netmask to
 255.0.0.0. 

</Para>


<Screen>

 # ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.2 up netmask 255.0.0.0
 # route add -net 10.0.0.0
 $ ping 10.0.0.1

</Screen>
 
<Para> 
 If everything is in working order, the router should respond to pings. How to
 configure this permanently will vary from distro to distro. So check your
 distribution's documentation. Now you should be able to ping the
 modem/router, and, if all is well, beyond. Then use telnet or a web browser
 to do any further configuration of the router.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Even if the ISP is not offering any router options, there are quite a few
 available from third party manufacturers such as Netgear, Linksys, Cisco,
 Zyxel, Cayman, Alcatel and others. These will have all the features already
 mentioned and maybe more. Just make sure it matches your provider's DSL. This
 is one good way around the PPPoX bugaboo.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 <Emphasis>Warning!</Emphasis> Some manufacturers may be marketing these as
 having 'firewall' capabilities. In some cases, this amounts to nothing more
 than basic NAT (Network Address Translation or masquerading). Not a full,
 true firewall by any means. Be sure to read the fine print before buying and
 make sure you know how much real firewalling is included.

<Sect2>
<Title>Which Ports?</Title>

<Para>
 There are plenty of references around on how to setup firewalls with
 <Command>ipfwadm</Command> or <Command>ipchains</Command>, but a little
 harder to find just which ports <Emphasis>really need</Emphasis> to be open.
 If you are not sure of the answer to this question, then the answer is 'as
 few as possible'! Basic rule #1, your computer cannot be broken into through
 a port that is not open. And, a port can't be open if nothing is listening on
 that port. In other words, if no service or daemon is running that uses that
 port, the port is closed and inaccessible.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 There are 65,536 ports available for use on Linux. These fall into several
 categories. The ones we are most concerned about are the 'privileged'
 ports, i.e. those below port 1024. This is where most public services run, like
 SMTP on port 25, HTTP on port 80, named on port 53, etc. These are where most
 vulnerabilities are on Linux. These are ports that servers accept outside
 connections on. If you are running the <Command>telnetd</Command> daemon, it
 will 'listen' for connections on port 23. (Actually if spawned by
 <Command>inetd</Command>, it may be <Command>inetd</Command> that is
 listening.) But, if you want to use a telnet <Emphasis>client</Emphasis> to
 connect to someone else's telnet server, you do not need to be running the
 <Command>telnetd</Command> daemon on your own system. You just need to start
 the client program named '<Command>telnet</Command>' (different animal). Same
 is true for ftp and other services. These daemons only need to be run for
 excepting connections to your system from an outside source. 

</Para>

<Para>
 Unless you have a good reason for doing so, and know what you are doing, then
 you should not be running these services. In fact, you could probably survive
 quite nicely with all TCP and UDP ports below 1024 closed down. Or, at least
 not visible to outside connections (i.e. blocked via a firewall). A couple of
 exceptions: 
</Para>

<Para>
 It is relatively safe, and probably reasonable, to run
 <Command>identd</Command> (port 113). Many mail and irc servers aren't happy
 without <Command>identd</Command> there. This is the one, good exception to
 the 'nothing below 1024' rule of thumb. Newer versions are relatively secure.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Mail is a little more complicated. The only reason to have a publicly
 accessible SMTP (port 25) server is if you are hosting your own mail server
 and receiving direct incoming mail connections. If you are retrieving mail
 via POP3 from your ISP, this port does not need to be open to the world. Such
 mail does not come in via port 25. It comes in through a higher, randomly
 assigned port. But -- it may still be convenient to have a mail daemon like
 sendmail, qmail, or postfix running to handle local mail delivery. In fact,
 this is a common default set up. You can get around this by firewalling off
 SMTP (port 25) from the outside world, or using another method to sort and
 deliver local mail. One way is to use procmail in conjunction with fetchmail:
 '<Literal>fetchmail -m /usr/bin/procmail -d hal</Literal>' will do this without
 having to run sendmail or other mail daemons in daemon mode. These programs 
 are still capable of sending mail in non-daemon mode.

</Para>

<Para>
 It is probably safe to run a web server if you want to. Most vulnerabilities
 there are through CGI. Just keep the web server package updated.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 OK, enough exceptions. Shut down, or firewall off, <Emphasis>everything
 else</Emphasis> below port 1024.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Those ports above 1023 are known as 'non-privileged' ports. These are mostly
 used for return connections that you have initiated to someone else's server.
 For instance, if you telnet to someone else, you connect to their port 23.
 The return data comes back to you on a randomly assigned port above 1023.
 These are mostly safe, and in fact, should as a rule be left alone. The only
 exceptions are where there are indeed services running on these ports. X
 Windows runs on ports 6000-6009 for instance. If you are running a font
 server, it may be on port 7100. Any servers running on these non-privileged
 ports, should be firewalled too.

<Sect2>
<Title>inetd</Title>

<Para>
 Let's take a quick look at <Command>inetd</Command>, since it starts many
 services. <Command>Inetd</Command> is a 'super' daemon. It is called this
 because it controls the starting of other daemons. Telnet, ftp, rsh, identd
 and pop3 are some of the server daemons commonly controlled by
 <Command>inetd</Command>. You may not see <Command>telnetd</Command> running
 when you use <Command>ps</Command> or <Command>netstat</Command> unless
 <Command>inetd</Command> is configured to start <Command>telnetd</Command>,
 <Emphasis>and</Emphasis> someone is actually connected to
 <Command>telnetd</Command> at the time. So it may not be so obvious which of
 these servers can be accessed from outside. These sub-services are controlled
 by the configuration file <Filename>/etc/inetd.conf</FileName>. Open this
 with your favorite text editor, and put a '#' character in front of any
 service you don't want running. A brief excerpt:

<Title>Performance Tuning and Troubleshooting</Title>

<Para>
 There really are no tweaks, or performance tuning tricks that are likely to
 increase your performance to any significant degree -- all other things being
 equal. Windows 9x users often get a big boost by increasing their TCP Receive
 Window. But this is because it is too small to start with. This is not the
 case with Linux. The only exception is if you have to routinely deal with a
 high latency connection. Such as maybe your provider has a satellite uplink
 that is consistently adding unusual latency (250ms or greater?). Then maybe a
 larger window will help. For the overwhelming majority of us, this is not
 necessary. For more on TCP Receive Window and related issues, look at <Ulink

</LiteralLayout>

<Para>
 Remember too that you will loose 10-20% of throughput to networking overhead.
 So a 1500 Kbps connection, is only going to realize about 1200-1300 Kbps or
 so of real world throughput. No tweaking is going to change this. And
 remember that if your service is capped at a lesser speed by your provider,
 then you can't get above that speed no matter what. <Emphasis>AND</Emphasis>

 quality, and subsequently your speed. Many of these are out of your control.

    Disconnect modem power cord and disconnect from wall jack. Plug it
    into the test jack inside the SNI/NID (outside phone box), and run
    extension cord if necessary for power cord. Temporarily disconnect the
    wiring to the inside phone circuit. This should effectively bypass any
    inside wiring and environmental issues. The ethernet cable to the NIC does
    not need to be connected just to run this test. The modem will sync fine
    without it. (Easier said than done in some cases, I know.) But if
    possible, move enough of your system where you can view the modem's
    diagnostics (if available) and get the sync rate. If this works, probably
    something is wired incorrectly inside, or a short in a connection
    somewhere, or there is severe electrical interference of the DSL signal.
    Check splitter and wall jack. If a splitterless installation, look for bad

    If no sync on the above test, either the line was not readied, or maybe

<Title>Sync Problems</Title>

<Para>
 Read this section if you have had a working connection, but now have lost
 sync, or are intermittently losing sync, or your sync rate has dropped
 significantly, or are getting a 'sync/no surf' condition. (Better quality
 modems will have a way to report sync rate. Usually via telnet or a web
 browser interface. See the owner's manual.)
 
</Para>

<Para>
 A loss of sync indicates a problem with the DSLAM, your line (inside or
 outside) or your modem. DSLAMs typically have 'shelves' with 'cards'. Alcatel
 DSLAM cards, just for instance, have a capacity of four connections each. If
 the card goes bad, at most four customers are effected. The point being that
 sync loss outages can be very isolated. Unlike network outages that tend to
 effect large numbers of users. Sync outages are also a telco problem, not an
 ISP problem. If your service agreement is with the ISP, you will need to
 contact them, who will in turn contact the telco.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Degraded sync rates, and disruption of the DSL signal, can cause various
 problems. Obviously, you will never get your maximum throughput under these
 conditions. But, the symptoms are not always obvious as to whether the
 problem is on your end or the provider's. For instance, a poor inside wire
 connection may result in retransmissions of packets that have been lost, or
 dropped. This can really reduce throughput and slow a connection down. It is
 tempting to think of lost packets as a traditional networking problem, but
 with DSL it is possible to be the result of a bad line, impaired signal, or 
 even the modem itself.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Some things to try:
 
</Para>

<Para>
 <ItemizedList>

 <ListItem> 
  <Para>
   Power cycle the modem. Turn off the power button/switch, and physically
   unplug the cable to the wall jack for 30 seconds or so. Turn back on, and
   re-attach to wall jack. This will force a resync. Unfortunately, the only
   way to power down a PCI modem, is to reboot. This should fix a 'sync/no
   surf' condition that is caused by the modem, and maybe other conditions
   too. 
   
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

 
  
  <ListItem> 
   <Para>
  
   See the <Link LinkEnd="nosync">above section</Link> on moving the modem
   lock, stock and barrel to the NID/SNI and thus bypassing all inside wiring.
   If the situation is improved there, then the problem is inside somewhere. If
   not, it is a telco problem.
 
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 


 <ListItem> 
  <Para>
   RFI Bear-hunt: The DSL signal is fragile. A number of things can degrade it.
   RFI, or Radio Frequency Interference, from sources in and around
   the home/office is one common source of reduced signal strength, and/or 
   intermittent sync loss and/or low sync rates. Our test tool here is simply
   a portable AM radio. Tune it to any channel where you can get clear
   reception -- makes no difference where. The AM radio will pick up RFI that
   is in the same frequency range as the DSL signal. It will sound like
   'frying bacon' type static. Put against your computer's power supply. You
   should hear some static. Move it away and the static should fade pretty
   quickly. This will give you an idea of what RFI sounds like. A decent
   quality power supply should produce only weak RFI -- probably not enough to
   cause a problem. Use the radio like a Geiger counter and move it around
   your modem and DSL line. If you hear static, follow it to the source.
   Things to be suspicious of: power supplies, transformers, ballasts,
   electric motors, dimmer switches, high intensity lighting. Moving modem, or
   rerouting cables, is sometimes enough. Keeping the line between the modem
   and the wall jack as short as possible is a good idea too.
 
   </Para>
  </ListItem>

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    Chronic sync problems are often due to a line problem somewhere.
    Sometimes it is something as simple as a bad splice, and easily remedied
    if it can be found. Most such conditions can be isolated by a good telco
    tech. Check with your provider, and politely harass if you have to. If you
    get the run-around, ask to go over their heads.
   
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If you are near the distance limits of DSL, and having off and on sync
    problems, try the 'homerun' installation. See <Link
    LinkEnd="homerun">above</Link>. This can be effective in improving
    marginal signal/sync conditions.
   
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

 </ItemizedList>
</Para>

<Para>
 Another possibility is a nearby AM radio station, or bandit ham radio
 operator that are disrupting the DSL signal since they operate in a similar 
 frequency range. These may only cause problems at certain times of day, like
 when the station boosts its signal at night. A good telco DSL tech may be
 able to help minimize the impact of this.

<Sect2>
<Title>Network Problems</Title>

<Para>
 Read this section if your connection is up, but are having throughput
 problems. In other words, your speed isn't what it should be based on your
 bit rate plan, and your distance from the CO. 'Network' here is the WAN --
 the ISP's gateway and local subnet/backbone, etc. Remember too that a
 marginal line can cause a reduced sync rate, and this will impact throughput.
 See <Link LinkEnd="synctr">above</Link>.

</Para>

<Para>
 The two factors we will be looking for are 'latency' and 'packet loss'. Both
 are pretty easy to track down with the standard networking tools
 <Command>ping</Command> and <Command>traceroute</Command>. If either of these
 occur in our path, they will impact performance. Latency means
 'responsiveness' or 'lag time'. Actually what we are interested in is
 abnormally high latency, since there is always some latency. Packet loss is
 when a packet of data gets dropped somewhere along the way. TCP/IP will know
 it's been 'lost', and there will be a retransmission of the lost data. Enough
 of this can really slow things down. Ideally packet loss should be 0%. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Also, what we really need to be concerned about, is that part of the WAN
 route that we routinely traverse. If you do a traceroute to several different
 sites, you will probably see that the first few 'hops' tend to be the
 same. These are your ISP's local backbone, and your ISP's upstream provider's
 gateway. Any problem with any of this, and it will effect everywhere you go,
 and everything you do. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 We can start looking for packet loss and latency by pinging two or three
 different sites, hopefully in at least a couple of different directions. We
 will be looking for packet loss and/or unusually high latency.

 High packet loss at 35%, and some really slow roundtrip times in there as
 well. A little digging on this showed that it was a backbone router 13 hops 
 into the traceroute that was the problem. While making this site really slow
 from here, it would only effect those routes that happen to hit that same
 router. Now what would really hurt us is if something similar happens with a
 router that we tend to go through consistently. Like our gateway, or maybe
 the second hop router too. Find these with <Command>traceroute</Command>, by

 It's a little tempting on this last real-life example to think this gateway
 router is acting up. But, as it turned out, this was the result of a problem
 in the DSLAM/ATM segment of the telco's network. So any first hop problem
 with packet loss or high latency, may actually be the result of something
 occurring before the first hop. But we just don't have the tools to isolate
 where it is starting well enough. Packet loss can be a telco problem, just as
 much as an ISP/NSP problem.

</Para>

 It is also possible for the modem itself to cause packet loss. The fix here
 is to power cycle the modem, and resync by unplugging the DSL connection for 
 30 seconds or so.

<Title>Measuring Throughput</Title>

<Para>
 No such thing as too fast, right? One of the first things most of us do is
 check our speeds to make sure we aren't getting short changed, and that our
 system is up to snuff. Doing this accurately is easier said than done
 however. First, remember you are losing 10-20% right off the top due to
 networking overhead. Just how much is 'lost' here depends on your provider's
 network architecture and other considerations. 
</Para>

<Para> 
 Then, any time you hit the Internet, there is some slight degradation of
 performance with each hop you take. Now this may not amount to much, as long
 as you are not taking too many hops and all the components -- your system,
 your ISP's network, your ISP's upstream provider, and the destination itself
 -- are all working like well oiled machines. But there's the rub -- how do
 you really know with so many variables in the mix? One flaky interface, on
 one router, on one hop along the path, may cause misleading results.

</Para>

<Para>
 Your absolute max speed is going to be at your point of connection to your
 ISP -- the ISP's gateway. It can only go downhill from there, not up! So the
 ideal test is as close to home as possible. This eliminates as many unknown
 variables as possible. If your ISP has a local ftp server, this is an
 excellent place to run your own tests. (Run a traceroute though just to see
 how local it really is.) If your ISP does not have this, look for an ftp site
 that is close -- the fewer the hops, the better. And look for one that isn't
 too busy, or you will get misleading results. Find a large file -- like 10
 Megs -- and time the download. Try this over several days, and at different
 times of day. The server, and the backbone, are going to be busier at certain
 times of day, which can skew results and you want to eliminate these 
 variables as much as possible. Your provider cannot compensate for heavy
 backbone traffic, backbone bottlenecks, slow or busy servers, etc. 

</Para>

<Para>
 There are many test sites scattered around the web. Some are better than
 others, but take these with a grain of salt. There are just too many
 variables for these tests to reliably give you an accurate snapshot of your
 connection and throughput. They may give you a general picture of whether you
 are in the ballpark of where you think you should be or not. One good speed
 test is <Ulink

 Another test is <Ulink

</Para>

<Para>
 Now keeping in mind that we are limited by the ~10-20% networking overhead rule,
 here is an example. My speed is capped at 1472 Kbps. Minus the ~15% is 1275
 Kbps. My sync rate is known to be good and my distance to the CO is about
 9000 Ft, which is close enough that I should be able to hit my real world

 <Emphasis>Big Caution</Emphasis>: my ISP uses a caching proxy server for
 web pages. This is a big equalizer for these kinds of web based

 from the proxy -- NOT the test site. Just FYI. Another note: at the same time
 I tried another test site and was consistently getting 600-700 Kbps. So YMMV
 with these tests. (Usually I get the same on each, more or less.) Timing a
 large ftp download, I calculated about 1.25 Mbps.

<Title>Appendix: DSL Overview</Title>


<Para>
 DSL is a telephone loop technology that uses existing copper phones lines, 
 and provides a dedicated, high speed Internet connection. One of the big
 advantages of some DSLs (notably ADSL), are that they can co-exist on the
 same line with a traditional voice service or 'POTS' (Plain Old Telephone
 Service). This is accomplished by utilizing different frequency ranges above
 the voice range (voice is up to 4KHz). Essentially, this gives two lines in
 one: one for POTS, and one for Internet connectivity. When all is working
 normally, there should be no interference between the two 'lines'. This gives
 DSL a potentially broad consumer base, and helps minimize costs for 
 providers.

</Para>

<Para>
 DSL is positioned for the Home and Small Office (SOHO) market that is 
 looking for high speed Internet access at reasonable prices. Since it also
 typically provides dedicated, 'always on' access, it can be used for
 interconnecting low to mid range bandwidth servers, and provides a great
 access solution for small LANs. It is also great for those Linux power users
 that just want a fast pipe  :-).

</Para>

<Para>
 Phone companies, and other independent telecommunications providers (CLECs),
 are now deploying DSL as fast as they can to stay ahead of the Cable
 companies -- the main consumer and SOHO competition for DSL providers. This
 mad rush to get 'a piece of the pie', is bringing much competition (a good
 thing!), much diversity, and some confusion, into the consumer market.
 The DSL provider (often, but not always, the phone company) will provide the
 DSL infrastructure. This would include your line, the DSLAM, and physical
 connection to the outside world. From there it is typically picked up by an
 ISP, who provides the traditional Internet services.
 
</Para>


<Para>
 Consumer DSL plans are typically 'best effort' services. While boasting
 speeds approaching T1, and even surpassing that in some cases, it is not
 necessarily as reliable as T1 however. Business class DSL offers more
 reliability at a higher cost than consumer plans, and is a good compromise
 where both reliability and bandwidth are at a premium. All in all, the cost
 of DSL compared to traditional telco services, such as T1, is attractive and
 substantially more affordable for home and small business users.

<comment> DSL generally does not offer service contracts for home users, while
DSL for business offers similar SLA (Service Level Agreements) to that offered
when getting a T1 line.

See next para. HB.

<Para>
 DSL providers generally do not have service contracts for home users,
 while business class DSL services typically do include similar SLA (service
 level agreements) to that offered for a T1 line.

</Para>

<Para>
 The downside is that DSL is not available everywhere. Availability, and
 available bit rate (speed), are purely a function of where you live, where
 the telco has installed the prerequisite hardware, how far you are from the
 DSLAM/CO, and the quality of your phone line (loop). Not all loops are
 created equal, unfortunately. The primary limitation is distance.

   or Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop. This DSL type currently supports
   downstream rates up to 8 Mbps, and upstream of 1024 Kbps, hence the
   'asymmetric'. The most widely deployed form of DSL at this time, and was
   specifically developed for the home and SOHO markets. The higher downstream
   rates lends itself to those not running serious servers -- at least
   anything more than a small, personal web site. ADSL is capable of sharing
   data with a POTS voice line, so an additional line is not required. A big
   selling point. ADSL, like other DSLs, is limited by distance. 18,000 ft
   (5.5 km) is a typical cut-off point for telcos. ADSL does typically require
   either a splitter or filters to isolate the DSL signal from POTS.
   Sometimes referred to as 'full rate' ADSL in order to differentiate it from
   G.Lite DSL. There are two common line encodings for ADSL: DMT and CAP. DMT
   (a.k.a. Alcatel compatible) has won the standards battle and is now the
   more common of the two. Also, note that modems must be compatible with the
   encoding. In other words, a CAP modem will not work with a DMT service, and
   vice versa.

   Currently G.Lite supports speeds up to 1.5 Mbps/512 Kbps, and is expected

   Single-pair Digital Subscriber Loop, or also sometimes referred to
   as 'Symmetric Digital Subscriber Loop' since it is indeed symmetric with a
   current maximum rate of 1.5 Mbps/1.5 Mbps. SDSL requires a dedicated line,
   and thus true SDSL is not as readily adaptable to the consumer market as
   ADSL. SDSL also uses a 2B1Q encoding (same as ISDN and some T1) which is
   considered more robust than the DMT or CAP encoding of ADSL. True SDSL is
   generally considered more of a server quality DSL. It is worth noting that
   some providers may be marketing a 'SDSL' service that is really ADSL pinched
   so that upstream/downstream are the same. Wasn't all this confusing enough
   already?

<comment> Why is Symmetric DSL wrong?  It IS always symmetric...

Actually the term here 'Single Line (or pair)' was coined to explicitly to
differentiate it from HDSL, which required multiple pairs for significant
speeds. This was (is) is big drawback to HDSL. It is coincidence that it is
also symmetric. So a technicality really, and who really cares anyway ;)

Also, noted that 'some T1' uses 2B1Q, but cannot find the reference where I
originally got that from.

   ISDN Digital Subscriber Loop, 144 Kbps/144 Kbps is really a new and

   benefits are that it is an 'always on' technology, like other DSLs, and
   provides an additional 16 Kbps over traditional ISDN. It is being marketed
   by some DSL providers as a low end bit rate option, where line quality is
   not sufficient for higher speeds such as that of ADSL.

 in the telco's Central Office. DSLAMs come in various shapes and sizes, and
 are the one, single complex and costly component of a DSL connection. When
 a qualified phone line is connected to a modem at the user's end of the loop,
 a high speed digital connection is established, typically over ATM, or
 sometimes frame relay. The DSLAM splits the signal back into separate voice
 and data channels. The voice channel stays within the telco network, whereas
 the data is picked up by an ISP.

<Title>Sync</Title>
 
<Para> 
 A good, working connection to the DSLAM is referred to as 'syncing'. Without
 sync, nothing happens. The modem will establish a sync rate which is often
 throttled by the provider at a predefined limit. This limit, or 'cap', is at
 the provider's discretion and is part of the service that is being provided.
 Your modem may well sync at a higher rate than the 'cap', but your speed will
 be limited to whatever 'cap' the provider is enforcing. So while ADSL has an
 upward theoretical limit of 8 Mbps, you will not see that speed -- unless of
 course your provider is selling an 8 Mbps plan. Most plans are well below
 this.

<Para>
 First notice the 'Current Attainable Rate' in the 'ATU-C' column. This is the
 downstream sync rate negotiated by the modem and DSLAM, which is over
 3.5 Mbps. The actual speed is limited, however, to 1.5 Mbps/384 Kbps from the
 first row 'TX Rate'. This is the theoretical limit of this connection. This
 limit, or 'cap', can be enforced at the DSLAM, as is the case the here, or
 further upstream. Had the first row 'TX Rate' been lower than the provider's
 imposed limit, then this would indicate some kind of problem with the
 connection, perhaps due to distance or some kind of line impairment. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 The attainable sync rate is the result of a number of factors, including wire
 distance to the DSLAM, quality of both inside and outside wiring, the loop
 wire gauge and various other factors within the loop.  Actual measurable,
 real world throughput, on the other hand, is first of all dependent on sync
 rate. Low sync rate means low throughput. In the above example, had the sync
 rate been lower, say 500 Kbps, then that would be the maximum for that
 connection, even though the customer is paying for a 1.5 Mbps service.
</Para> 
 
<Para> 
 Secondarily, throughput will depend also on the ISP's network, and then the
 ISP's upstream provider.  You will lose approximately 10-20% of potential
 throughput to networking overhead. In the above example where the connection
 is throttled at 1.5 Mbps, the actual, real-world maximum throughput would be
 somewhere around 1.2 Mbps when overhead is taken into account. Moreover, once
 you hit the Internet proper, all bets are off as there are any number of
 factors that may impact throughput. A overloaded or busy server is likely to
 be slow no matter how fast your DSL connection is.

<Title>DSL Modems</Title>

<Para>
 The modem is the last piece of the connection. The modem is connected
 directly to the DSLAM via the copper loop on the telco end, and plugs into a
 wall jack on your end. When all is well, the modem 'syncs' with the DSLAM,
 and then makes an IP connection to the ISP. And off we go!

</Para>

<Para>
 For Linux users, <Emphasis>the modem is a very important
 consideration</Emphasis>! You will need an external, ethernet interfaced
 modem (or modem/router combo) that connects via a standard NIC, since
 virtually all other modem options (PCI, USB, onboard) will not work due to a
 lack of drivers at this time! All ethernet based modems will work fine. The
 only potential compatibility issue is the NIC. (And really any compatible
 ethernet NIC should do just fine -- 100 Mbps is not necessary.) You are
 probably better off anyway, since PCI and USB modems are more problem prone.
 If your chosen provider does not offer a compatible modem as an option, then
 you either need to look elsewhere, or you will have to buy one outright from
 a third party.

</Para>

<Para>
 As always there are exceptions.  Diamond makes an internal PCI modem which
 has binary-only drivers, and is not in widespread use. <Ulink
 url="http://www.efficient.com">Efficient Networks</Ulink> is beta testing
 Linux drivers for their SpeedStream 3060 and 3061 PCI modems, and is expected
 to be released 'any day'. At this time, this will require a 2.4.x kernel, and
 a patch as well for the necessary ATM support. Efficient is working with
 kernel developers to make their products Linux compatible. The initial
 version will have binary drivers only, but open sourced drivers are future
 possibility. It is also possible to make a direct ATM connection using a
 modem plus an ATM card, though this delivery system is not used in the U.S.
 as far as I know, and should not be considered as a viable option. This also
 requires a 2.4 kernel.

</Para>

<Para>
 The most common type of modem in use today is actually a combination 'bridge'
 and modem device. The other less common option is a 'router'. The bridge is a
 simple device, typically with little configuration. Network traffic passes
 blindly across the bridge in either direction. Your point of exposure is the
 interface (typically a NIC) that is connected to the modem/bridge. 
</Para>

<Para>
 Some ISPs may also be offering 'routers'. These are basically combination
 modem/routers that can handle NAT, and may have other features such as port
 forwarding, a built in hub, etc. These are all external, so should work
 too. But probably not a big deal for Linux users, since Linux can do
 anything these do, and more. A locked down Linux box makes a most excellent
 firewall/gateway/proxy! 
</Para>

<Para>
 All providers should make available a 'modem' of some sort. Many ISPs will have
 more than one modem option. Some may give away the modem at no additional
 charge. Some may offer a free base model, and charge the difference for the
 better models with more features. Many of the modems that ISPs supply are not
 available through normal retail channels. Should you want to buy one
 yourself, this leaves used equipment outlets (e.g. ebay), or possibly buying
 a modem that your ISP may not support (i.e. a possibility of no tech support
 if you have a problem). 
</Para>

<Para>
 While some ISPs provide modems that are not readily available through normal
 retail channels, there are a number of manufacturers that are getting on the
 DSL modem bandwagon, and offering a good selection. Most have a
 number of enhancements. At this time Netgear, Linksys, Zyxel, Cisco, 3Com,
 and Cayman have products available. Depending on model and feature set,
 prices range from a little over $100 US to $800 and up. Many of these 
 handle their own authentication and encapsulation (DHCP, PPPoE, etc).
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Are some modems better than others? Well, fortunately for us the external,
 ethernet interfaced modems are the most reliable anyway. Fewer IRQ hassles,
 no buggy drivers, etc. So a blessing in disguise really. Are any of these
 better than others? Probably not. None are faster anyway. Certainly some may
 have more features, like the combo modem/routers. But realistically, most of
 this is so new there is not enough of a track record to compare brands and
 models with any degree of assurance. In other words, any old external,
 ethernet modem should do -- provided it matches your provider's DSL, and is
 configured for that service. 
</Para>

<Para>
 <Emphasis remap="bold">Warning!</Emphasis>  Make sure any third party modem
 or router you may purchase is compatible with your DSL provider. There are
 two major line encodings for ADSL (CAP, DMT a.k.a. Alcatel compatible), and
 several options for IP encapsulation. And different DSLs (SDSL, IDSL, etc)
 will require their own modem too. Your provider should have a list of
 compatible options.  It may well have to be configured for your ISP's service
 too. Don't expect it to work right out of the box either (unless it comes
 from your provider).  Many are accessible via telnet, or a web browser, where
 the configuration options are available. See the owner's manual for this.

 telco's ATM network (or frame relay), where it is picked up by the ISP. The
 ISP will take over at what we 'see' as the first hop on a
 <Command>traceroute</Command>.  Everything up to that point is in the hands
 of the telco/DSL provider. The ISP will connect to the ATM side of the DSLAM
 via a high-speed data connection, usually ATM over a T3 (45 Mbps) or OC-3
 (155 Mbps). The important thing here is that an ISP must 'subscribe' with
 your telco to provide this connection. The ISP will provide traditional ISP
 type services: email, DNS, news, etc. It is really a two step connection --
 DSL from one provider, Internet from a second -- even though these may be
 combined into one billing. 

</Para>

<Para>
 The Baby Bells (RBOCs) all own their own ISPs. These, of course, are
 connected to their DSLAMs, and are providing Internet services via the
 telco's ISP subsidiary.  But, also many independent ISPs are availing
 themselves of the ILEC's DSL services, and in essence 'reselling' the DSL
 services of the ILEC. While the underlying infrastructure is the same in this
 case, having more than one ISP working out of a CO may mean a better
 selection of features and prices for the consumer. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Also, CLECs (independent telcos) are now installing their own DSLAMs. This
 makes them a direct competitor to the ILEC. In this scenario, there would be
 two (or more) DSL providers in the same CO, each with their own DSLAM(s), and
 each competing against each other. This complicates the ISP situation even
 further, as each DSL provider will be 'partnered' with one or more ISPs. If
 you are lucky here, you will have many choices of plans and pricing
 structures.

</Para>

<Para>
 Typically, your service agreement is with the ISP, and not the DSL provider.
 This makes the actual DSL provider a 'behind the scenes' player.  Though
 this may vary, and in some cases, you may wind up with a separate service
 agreement for both the DSL provider and the ISP.

<Sect2>
<Title>Availability</Title>

<Para>
 Who can get DSL? The first requirement is that a telco has installed the
 necessary hardware in your CO. You have no choice on which CO is yours -- it
 is wherever your loop terminates. If your CO has a DSLAM, and the necessary
 other components, then DSL may be available to you. This is often known as
 'pre-qualifying', and is step one in getting service. 
 
</Para>



<!--   ~~~~~       New Section      ~~~~~     -->

<Sect3>
<Title>Ordering</Title>

<Para>
 Before ordering service, check to see what providers there are in your area.
 You may have several options, including the large phone companies, as well as
 smaller, local ISPs. Once an order is placed, you must wait for the
 qualification process before a provider will agree to provide service.
 
</Para>

</Sect3>

<!--  ~  End Section  ~  -->



<!--   ~~~~~       New Section      ~~~~~     -->

<Sect3 id="qualify">
<Title>Qualifying</Title>

<Para>
 Once local availability is established, the next step is 'qualifying' your
 loop. The provider will run various tests to make sure that your loop can
 handle the DSL signal. This is to determine how suitable your line is for
 DSL, and maybe what level of service will be available to you. You probably
 will have to order service just to find this much out. It can be a fairly
 involved process, with a variety of different tests being run. There
 are a number of things that may 'disqualify' a line. The most common
 limitation is distance. 
</Para>

<Para> 
 All DSLs have distance limitations. ADSL is limited
 to a loop length of roughly 18,000 ft (5.5 km), but the actual cut off point
 will vary from provider to provider. The further away you are, the weaker the
 signal, and the potential for poor connections is greater. With ADSL, if you
 are within approximately 12,000 ft (3.7 km), you should be able to get at
 least 1.5 Mbps -- all other things being equal. IDSL has even greater reach,
 mainly because the maximum speed for IDSL is considerably lower at 144
 Kbps/144 Kbps.

</Para>

<Para>
 Still even if close enough, there are a number of potential impediments that
 may disqualify a line: load coils and bridge taps are two such common
 impediments. These are aspects of the old telco infrastructure that once were
 deemed beneficial, but now are getting in the way of the newer, digital
 technologies.  Whether you hit a snag like this, is pretty much hit or miss.
 Fiber anywhere in the loop is also a disqualifier. The provider may take
 steps to 'clean' the line. Just how far they are willing to go will vary from
 provider to provider, and this will likely add additional time to
 installation process.

</Para>

<Para>
 Once the line is 'qualified', the next step is deciding on which plan is
 suitable for your situation.  The provider may have differing plans available
 depending on how strong a signal they think your line can handle. If you are
 marginal, you will not be qualified for the higher speed plans. And if price
 is a factor, having a tiered pricing structure is good also since the lower
 end plans are obviously less expensive. How this is structured will also vary
 wildly from provider to provider. Also, DSL is a new service, and providers
 are trying to find the right price/feature combinations that will attract the
 most users and thus gain a competitive edge.

 and a near infinite number of other possibilities as well. Cost of different
 plans, of course, generally goes up with speed.
</Para>

<Para>
 Should you be disqualified, and have other options, get a second opinion.
 Calculating the effective loop length is by no means an exact science. There
 is plenty of room for errors. Also, some providers may go to greater lengths
 to 'clean' the loop than others. And, if you have more than one phone line,
 and are disqualified, then try the other line. Just because they both
 terminate at your location, does not necessarily mean they are the same
 length! The telco network is full of surprises.

 Should you have more than one choice, here are some things to keep in mind
 when comparing services from different providers. If you are in a populous

 of possibilities at this time. Remember too, that it is a two step

<Title>Appendix: FAQs</Title>

<Para>
 Some Frequently Asked Questions about DSL and Linux.
</Para>

<Para>
<OrderedList>
 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. Does DSL work with Linux?
  </Para>

  <Para>
   DSL is a technology, or more correctly, a group of related technologies.
   This is akin to asking if Linux works with telephones. The technology
   itself does not care. So, the short answer is 'Yes, of course!'. The long
   answer is that if there are any impediments, they are being imposed by the
   provider. There are things they may do, that can make getting Linux up and
   running a more of a challenge than it needs to be. Not having a compatible
   modem option available is one common bugaboo. Also, if the telco or ISP is
   doing the installation, they may require a Windows or Mac system to be
   available. This saves them the costs of training their techs on various
   'alternative' OSes. Buyer beware!

  </Para>
   
  <Para>
   Basically all DSL does, is facilitate a high speed Internet connection. At
   some point, it is all TCP/IP, and Linux, of course, handles TCP/IP quite
   well.

  </Para>
   
 </ListItem> 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   Q. Where can I find drivers for my PCI (or USB) modem?
  </Para>

   <Para>
    As of this moment, you probably can't, because they are not available. You
    need an external, ethernet interfaced modem for all intents and purposes.
    If your provider does not offer one, you will have to find another
    provider, or buy your own modem outright. Just make sure it is compatible
    with your provider's flavor of DSL.
    
   </Para>
   
   <Para>
    If an incompatible modem puts you in a bind, hopefully you will take the
    time to politely harass the manufacturer  :-).
    
   </Para>

   <Para>
    This will likely change soon however. <Ulink
    URL="http://www.efficient.com">Efficient Networks</Ulink> is in late Beta
    stages with their SpeedStream 3060/3061 PCI drivers. Likely others will
    follow suit. (Make sure you are reading the latest version of this
    document, as I have intentions of keeping this situation updated as
    needed.)
   
   </Para>

  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
     Q. How fast or good of a network card do I need?
   </Para>
  
    <Para>
     Any card that is compatible with Linux should work fine. Remember even
     low-end cards are 10 Mbps, and no consumer class DSL is near that at this
     time. I would suggest a reasonably good quality card, just to help
     eliminate the possibility of errors and premature failure.
     
    </Para>
  </ListItem> 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. How can I find out when DSL will be available in my area?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   Just where and when DSL gets deployed is totally in the hands of your
   friendly local telco. They obviously can't do everyone at once, so they
   probably are selecting areas based on competitive factors. Getting a
   straight answer from a telco on this question, can also be a challenge.
   Probably also so as not to tip their hand to competitors. But, it is a
   question only they can answer.
  </Para>

 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. I was disqualified because I am too far away. What can I do?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   Move? Seriously, there isn't much you can do. If there are other providers, 
   get another opinion. You never know. Determining the loop length is an
   inexact science, and there is room for errors. Many use databases for
   this, and these databases routinely have some inaccuracies. Some providers
   too, may be more aggressive in taking steps to help you out and clean up
   the line. Also, some providers offer low-end speed services that have
   greater reach. Maybe this will become available in your area. Or, the telco
   will install, at some point, remote devices for customers who are now too
   far away.
  
  </Para>

 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. What are the speed tweaks for Linux?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   There aren't any really. Linux is pre-tweaked, unlike some versions of
   Windows that really need some registry hacks to get optimum performance.
  
  </Para>

  <Para>
   Now if you are convinced you are not getting the performance you should
   based on your distance and line conditions, then maybe there is a problem
   somewhere. See the <Link LinkEnd="tuning">Troubleshooting</Link> section for
   more. What you need is a fix, more than a tweak.
   
  </Para>

 </ListItem>
 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. My service is limited to 640K. Can I get better speed by getting a
    faster modem? Any way around this?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   No, and no. The modem has little bearing on how fast your connection is for
   all intents and purposes. The provider has a mechanism in place for
   limiting your speed somewhere in the pipe before you hit the Internet.
   There is no way to defeat this.
  
  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   Q. I am paying for 768 Kbps service, and the best I ever get is 620 Kbps or
   so. Why? Is the service oversold? I am not getting what I pay for.
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   You will lose 10-20% of the rated capacity due to networking overhead. This
   is just a fact of life for everybody. Just how much is lost here depends on 
   a number of factors, and may vary from provider to provider. You seem to be
   close to your maximum when this is taken into consideration. Also, if you
   read the fine print, many ISPs are advertising speeds 'up to' such and
   such. Check your service agreement and see if there are any guarantees. If
   there are, they probably are well below the advertised maximum speed. 
   
  </Para>

  <Para>
   Also, be careful how you test this. Some of the so-called test sites can be
   pretty unreliable. There can be many factors between you and that site that
   can impact your throughput and skew results -- not the least of which is
   how many people might be trying that same test at the same time. The best 
   test is via FTP download from a known good, close site.

  </Para>
 </ListItem> 
 
 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. Why does PPPoX have such a bad rap?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
    The tendency to abruptly disconnect is one of the biggest gripes. PPP is
    sensitive to any interruptions in the connection. Generally a disconnect
    means a new IP. And there are those that say PPP, by its very nature, was
    never meant to be an 'always on' protocol. PPP is a session management
    protocol at heart, that requires a user to initiate a connection and
    authenticate him or herself. PPPoE/A are not particularly mature protocols
    either. They do not have much of a history or track record. Some would say
    the telcos and hardware manufacturers have rushed this out the door. PPPoE
    also requires an additional layer of software just to maintain the
    connection. This is one more layer of code and one more potential point of
    failure. Also, more system overhead is utilized to manage the connection.
    
   </Para>

 </ListItem>

 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. Why PPPoX? This seems like a bad idea!
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   PPP gives several advantages to the provider: they can use their existing
   infrastructure and hardware that they now use for their (larger) dialup
   customer base. It is easier to control user authentication and potential
   abuse situations, and easier to manage their network and related issues. In
   fact, it most boils down to its just easier for them. Easier, means saves
   man hours, and therefore saves costs (at least from their perspective).
  
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   It is not a conspiracy to conserve IP addresses, or thwart heavy users. IP
   address costs are insignificant in the overall scheme of things.
   
  </Para>

 </ListItem>
 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. The only provider in my area does not support Linux. What can I do?
    Will I have to use Windows?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   NO! 'Support' here is support as in 'tech support'. They are just saying
   that they will not give you tech support when and if you have problems.
   This does not mean you cannot use Linux on their network. Just that you may
   have to fend for yourself when and if a problem does arise. Anything that
   is forbidden will be in their Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), or Terms of
   Service (TOS) agreement.
   
  </Para>

  <Para>
   I have heard stories where a new tech or installer has misinterpreted their
   own company's policy on this and told someone 'you can't use Linux here'.
   Same with NT server. But this is almost always a misinformed individual.
 
  </Para>

  <Para>
   But -- if a provider does not support Linux, they may balk at installing
   onto a Linux box. Hopefully, they will have a self-install option to get
   around this annoyance. YMMV.
 
  </Para>

 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. My fax software does not work with my DSL modem. Why is that?
  
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
    Faxes are normally transmitted over typical analog phone lines by dialing 
    the fax machine on the other end. Analog modems can handle this, but 
    DSL modems have no dialing capability. Don't throw out that 56K yet!
    
  </Para>

 </ListItem>
 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   Q: Are there ADSL Standards?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   A: Sort of. The U.S. Bell Operating Companies have standardized on Discrete
   Multi-Tone (DMT) (ANSI T1.413) in their current rollout.  Most others
   should follow their lead in the states. There are other types of modems, most
   notably Carrier-less Amplitude Phase Modulation (CAP), which, of course, are
   incompatible with each other.  
  </Para>
 
  <Para>

   it provides the best detail on this issue I have seen so far.

  </Para>
 </ListItem>
 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   Q: Can I use ATM to connect to DSL?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   A: Technically speaking, you can. Some DSL modems (at least the Alcatel
   version) has a ATM Forum 25Mbps interface,  which connects to a PCI ATM
   card. See <Ulink
   URL="http://lrcwww.epfl.ch/linux-atm/">http://lrcwww.epfl.ch/linux-atm/</Ulink> 
   for more details.
  </Para>
 </ListItem>
 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   Q: Why does DSL have all these bit rates (384/1.5/8M/20M/etc) options?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   A: The basic problem is the 100 year old design of the copper loop.  It works
   great for analog phone, but it presents a real challenge for a digital
   signal. Remember that the distance of a loop is inversely proportional to the
   data rate that it can carry. Rate-Adaptive technologies are great for making
   a digital signal work in many situations, but it can't provide a consistent
   bandwidth for all applications, especially for very long (over 18,000 ft)
   loops.  The different bandwidth that you see advertised reflect various
   marketing wars of vendors equipment, and the telco struggle to finalize on a
   'standard' set of data rates.
  </Para>
 
  <Para>
   Also, check out the next question on the loop impairments that cause this to
   happen.
  </Para>
 </ListItem>
 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   Q: What are all these loop impairments (bridge taps, load coils, DLCs) that
   could disqualify my line from DSL? (thanks to Bruce Ediger) 
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   Load coils: in-line inductances that improve voice-frequency transmission
   characteristics of a telephone circuit.  Essentially, a "load" steals energy
   from high frequencies and gives it to lower frequencies.  Typically only used
   in very long (&#62;9,000 ft) phone lines.
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   By "bridges" I assume you mean "bridged taps".  In older neighborhoods, the
   phone wiring will have been used by more than one customer.  Perhaps these
   customers lived at different (though near-by) addresses.  The unconnected
   "spur" of wiring is a "bridged tab" on the currently connected circuit.
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   DLCs, Digital Loop Carriers: there's a bunch of systems for carrying more
   than one voice transmission on a single pair of wires.  You can shift the
   frequencies up or down, or you can digitize the voice transmissions and
   divide the telephone circuit by time or code or something.  The more
   general term is "pair gain".
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   These things cause different problems for high-frequency communications.
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   Load coils will completely mess up things by filtering high frequencies and
   passing low frequencies.  They probably also change the "delay envelope",
   allowing some frequencies to arrive before others.  One byte's tones will
   interfere with the next byte's.
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   Bridged taps act as shunt capacitances if they're long in relation to the
   signals wavelength, and they'll actually act as band pass filters if they're
   about 1/4 wavelength of the signal.  That is, they'll pass particular
   frequencies freely.  Particular tones of a DMT modem might get shunted back,
   rather than passed along to the receiving modem, reducing bandwidth for that
   telephone line.
  </Para>
 
  <Para>
   Pair gain, digital or analog, limit the bandwidth available to one
   transmission in order to multiplex several on one wire.  High and low tones
   of a DMT transmission get filtered out by the apparatus.
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   The book "Subscriber Loop Signaling and Transmission Handbook", by Whitham D.
   Reeve, , IEEE Press 1992, ISBN 0-87942-274-2 covers the math of how to
   calculate the effect of line length, bridged tap, etc on the transmission
   characteristics of a telephone line.  It's pretty expensive, however.
  </Para>
 </ListItem>
 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   Q: Do you have examples of DSL Modems?
  </Para>
   
  <Para>
   A: Short Answer: Yes. Real Answer: The evolution of this technology is
   moving too rapidly for anyone to keep up to date in a HOWTO.  A good source

<Sect3 id="cable">
<Title>Cable Modem vs DSL</Title>

<Para>
 The Telcos see DSL as a competitor to the Cable Company's Cable
 Modem, and as such, are providing competitive pricing and configuration
 offerings. Although Cable Modems are advertised as having 10-30Mbps potential 
 bandwidth, they use a shared transmission medium with many other users on the
 same line, and therefore performance varies, perhaps greatly, with the amount
 of traffic, time of day, and number of other users on the same node.  

</Para>

<Para>
 It is often heard that DSL has an advantage in that it is a private pipe to
 the Internet, with dedicated bandwidth. This is mostly a myth. You do have a
 private pipe to the DSLAM, but at that point, you enter the telco's ATM (or
 frame relay) network, and start sharing bandwidth. You are at the mercy of
 how well your DSL provider and ISP manage their networks. The consensus seems
 to be that DSL providers and ISPs are doing a better job of managing
 bandwidth than the Cable companies. It is easier for them to add and adjust
 bandwidth as needed to meet demand. You are less likely to have speed
 fluctuations due to other users being on line at the same time. But, again,
 this gets down to how well the network and bandwidth are managed.

</Para>


<Para>
 DSL probably has a small security advantage too. With most Cable modem
 networks, it is like being on a big LAN. You are sharing your connection (and
 bandwidth) right at the point of connection. But if you are not doing
 something to filter incoming connections already, you are asking for trouble
 either way. 
</Para>

<Para>
 There also seems to be a better chance of having ISP alternatives with DSL
 than Cable. Choice is a good thing, and so is competition. It seems most
 Cable outfits give you just one choice for an ISP. If you don't like it, you
 are out of luck. The number of options with DSL probably varies greatly by
 geographic areas. Populous areas, like Northeast U.S., seem to have many
 options. 
</Para>

<Para>
 So which is better? The differences aren't as much with the technology, as they
 are with the implementations. If you look around, you can find plenty of
 horror stories on either. And plenty of happy customers too. The way
 to know what may be the best for you, is to do comparative shopping based on
 experiences of other users in your area. Don't base your choice on one
 person's opinion. This is statistically invalid. Likewise, don't base your
 choice on someone's opinion who has had a particular service for only a short
 time. Again, statistically not worth much. Get as many opinions from those
 that are using the <Emphasis>exact same services</Emphasis> that you are
 looking at.

<Title>Integrated Fiber in the Loop (IFITL or FTTC)</Title>

<Para>
 In some areas, newer neighborhoods are being built with fiber optic cable
 instead of the traditional telco copper lines. While the fiber is a definite
 problem for DSL services, it has it's own potential advantages. Existing
 fiber is potentially capable of 100 Mbps, and it looks like this could easily
 go up soon. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 So while telco fiber customers are being shut out of the DSL market, they may
 have much to look forward to. Technologies are under development, and in some
 cases just now being deployed, to take advantage of fiber telco phone loops.
 Known as 'FTTC' (Fiber To The Curb), or 'IFITL' (Integrated Fiber In The
 Loop), this technology is another high speed service that telcos can offer.
 The speeds are sufficient for VoD (Video on Demand) and VoDSL (Voice over
 DSL), and other high bandwidth services. One nice advantage here is, that
 since there is no DSL signal on the wire, the only required CPE is a network
 card. In other words, no modem -- just connect a NIC to the wall jack and off
 you go!

By 'friendly' we mean ISPs that don't put up any unnecessary impediments just
because you aren't running that other guy's OS. And yes, there is some of
that going around. If your choices are limited, and you are forced to deal
with one of these, then having a Windows box available temporarily is one work
around. Another, may be to sweet talk the installer into letting you finish
the installation (NIC, etc). Of course, self installation, if available,
should be completely 'Linux compatible'.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 So to make this list, the ISP/provider must make available some type of
 workable modem (ethernet interface at this point in time). And, should not
 penalize you, or make things difficult, just because you are running an
 alternate OS. Installing directly onto Linux should be an available option,
 and should not cause you any undue hardship. Technical support for Linux is a
 nice bonus, but not necessary to make the list. Please do not take these as
 recommendations. Do your own homework.

<Title id="linrouter">Setting up Linux as a Router</Title>



<Para>
 Depending on your local setup, you should consider some other issues.  These
 include a firewall setup, and any associated configurations.  For my setup,
 shown in Figure 5 below, I use an old i486 machine configured as a
 firewall/router between the DSL connection and the rest of my machines.  I
 use private IP addresses on my private LAN subnet, and have configured my
 router to provide IP Masquerading and Firewalling between the LAN and
 Internet connection. See the <Ulink
 URL="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/IP-Masquerade-HOWTO.html">IP
 Masquerade HOWTO</Ulink> , and <Ulink
 URL="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Firewall-HOWTO.html">Firewall
 HOWTO</Ulink> for more information. Also, for 2.4 kernels see <Ulink
 URL="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO.html"
>Linux 2.4 Advanced Routing HOWTO</Ulink>. My experience is that Linux is more
 flexible and provides superior routing/firewalling performance. And it is
 much less expensive than a commercial router, if you find an old 486 machine
 that you may be using as a doorstop somewhere.

</Para>


<Para>
 What I did is setup a Linux router (Redhat Linux 5.0  on a i486) with two
 ethernet interfaces. One interface routes to the ISP subnet/gateway (eth0 in
 above example), and the other interface (eth1 above) goes to a hub (or switch)
 and then connects the LAN with private network addresses (e.g. 192.168.1.x).
 Using the private network address behind your router/firewall allows some
 additional security because it is not directly addressable from outside. You
 have to explicitly masquerade your private addresses in order to connect to
 the Internet from the LAN. The LAN hosts will access the Internet via the
 second NIC in the Linux router. Just set their gateway to the IP address of
 the second NIC, and assign them addresses on the same network.

</Para>

<Para>
 <Emphasis remap="bf">Caution</Emphasis> Make sure your kernel is complied
 with IP forwarding and the IP forwarding is turned on. You can check this
 with '<Command>cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</Command>'. The value is '1'
 for on, and '0' for off.  You can change this value by echoing the desired
 value into this file:
</Para>

<Screen>

 # echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
 
</Screen>

<Para>
 You will also need to set up 'IP Masquerading' on the Linux router. Depending
 on your kernel version, this is done with <Command>ipfwadm</Command> (2.0),
 <Command>ipchains</Command> (2.2), or <Command>iptables</Command> (2.4).
 See the documentation for specifics on each. AND -- do not forget to have
 that firewall set up too!
