</Para>



<Para>
 This document examines the DSL family of high speed Internet services now
 being deployed in various markets worldwide.  Information is included on the
 technology behind DSL as well as subscribing, installing, configuring, and
 troubleshooting, with an emphasis on how this impacts Linux users.  
</Para>

</Abstract>

<Sect1 id="intro">
<Title>Introduction</Title>

<Para>
 DSL, or Digital Subscriber Loop, is a high-speed Internet access technology
 that uses a standard copper telephone line (a.k.a. <Quote>loop</Quote> in
 telco parlance). DSL provides a direct, dedicated connection to an ISP via
 the existing telco network. DSL is designed to run on up to 80% of the
 telephone lines available in the United States. By using line-adaptive
 modulation, DSL is capable of providing data speeds of 8 Mbps or more. 

</Para>

<Para>
 DSL services are now being aggressively marketed for home and small business
 use. DSL is typically priced below ISDN, and well below T1 service, yet can
 provide potentially even greater speeds than T1 without the
 cost, complexity, and availability issues of T1. Since DSL is a dedicated,
 often <Quote>always on</Quote> service, it avoids the delays and use charges
 that are common with ISDN. Making this quite a nice technology for the
 bandwidth starved masses.

</Para>

<Para>
 While all this sounds exciting, DSL does have some drawbacks. The quality of
 the DSL signal, and thus the connection, depends on distance (the length of
 the copper <Quote>loop</Quote>) and various other factors. Also, there is no
 such thing as standard <Quote>DSL</Quote>. There are various flavors of DSL,
 and many, many ways DSL providers are implementing their networks. In typical
 fashion, Linux users are often left to fend for themselves, since the DSL
 providers are often taking the easy way out, and catering only to
 <Quote>mainstream</Quote> Operating Systems.

</Para>

<Para>
 The topics included in this HOWTO include qualification and pre-installation,
 installation, configuration, troubleshooting and securing a DSL connection. As
 well as other related topics. There are also appendices including a
 comprehensive <Link LinkEnd="overview">DSL Overview</Link>, <link
 linkend="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</link>, a listing of <link
 linkend="links">related links</link>, and a <link
 linkend="glossary">glossary</link>. </Para>

<Para>
 Due to the fast pace of change in the telco and DSL industries, please make
 sure you have the latest version of this document. The current official
 version can always be found at 
 <Ulink

<Sect2>
<Title>Document Structure and Reading Guidelines</Title>

<Para>
 This document attempts to give a comprehensive discussion of DSL. All aspects 
 are hopefully addressed to one degree or another with what can be a complex
 topic since it deals with networking, hardware, new fangled technologies, and 
 various approaches taken by various vendors. The core components of this
 document are:
 
</Para>

<Para>
 <ItemizedList>

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    The <Link LinkEnd="installation">Installation</Link> section covers
    installation of DSL hardware and related components, including wiring
    considerations, splitter or microfilter installation, modem and Network
    card installation. 
       
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    The <Link LinkEnd="configure">Configuring Linux</Link> section covers
    mostly client and software aspects of getting the connection up and
    running. The Network card configuration is actually covered mostly in the
    above Installation section.
    
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    The <Link LinkEnd="secure">Securing Your Connection</Link> section covers
    Security implications that are even more important with a full-time
    connection. Linux users seem especially targeted by crackers, because
    quite frankly, some don't understand how important security is, or don't
    understand the finer points of this. And who wants to <quote>own</quote> 
    a Windows box?
 
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    The <Link LinkEnd="tuning">Tuning and Troubleshooting</Link> section
    covers post-installation topics like how well is our connection performing,
    and how to track down any show-stoppers or intermittent problems.
   
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    There is also a lengthy Appendix that covers various topics relating to
    Linux and DSL. None of these are directly related to simply getting that
    connection up and running, but may be of interest nonetheless.
  
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

 </ItemizedList>
</Para>



<Para>
 To simplify the navigation of this document, below is a suggested reading 
 guideline. Everyone should read the Introduction. Please pay special
 attention to the <Link LinkEnd="usage">Conventions and Terminology</Link>
 section, as some of this terminology may be used somewhat differently in
 other contexts. Also, there is a <Link LinkEnd="glossary">Glossary</Link> if
 you get lost in the world of TA (telco acronyms) ;-).
 
</Para>

<Para>
 <ItemizedList>

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If you don't know anything about DSL, you should probably read the entire 
    document. You may want to start with the <Link LinkEnd="overview">DSL
    Overview</Link> section in the Appendix, and then the <Link
    LinkEnd="faq">FAQ</Link>. The DSL Overview explains how the various pieces
    of the puzzle fit together. DSL network implementations are more complex
    than traditional dialup networks. 
    
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If you have already done some homework, but have not ordered service from
    anyone yet, read the <Link LinkEnd="cproviders">Choosing
    Providers</Link> section. Also, you might get a head start by reading the
    <Link LinkEnd="configure">Configuring Linux</Link> section so you know
    what lies ahead.

   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If you have ordered service already, and are awaiting delivery, you can
    skip the sections on choosing a Provider. If you will be doing a
    self-install, you should read the pertinent parts of the <Link
    LinkEnd="installation">Installation</Link> section, the <Link
    LinkEnd="configure">Configuring Linux</Link> section, and the <Link
    LinkEnd="secure">Securing Your Connection</Link> section.
   
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If the installation is complete, and you can't get a working connection, 
    skip right to the <Link LinkEnd="tuning">Troubleshooting</Link> Section. 
    If you are not clear on what protocols are required, or what software you 
    need to have installed, also read the <Link
    LinkEnd="configure">Configuring Linux</Link> section. If not sure what
    terms like <Quote>sync</Quote> mean in this context, then be sure to read
    the <Link LinkEnd="overview">DSL Overview</Link> section first so you know
    how it all fits together.
 
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If trying to decide between cable and DSL, read the 
    <Link LinkEnd="cable">Cable vs DSL</Link> section, and possibly the 
    <Link LinkEnd="overview">DSL Overview</Link> section.
  
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If you have never had a full-time Internet connection, or are not
    absolutely sure you fully understand how to secure you connection, 
    be sure to read The <Link LinkEnd="secure">Securing Your Connection</Link>
    section. If you don't understand some aspect of this, re-read it, or start 
    looking for other references.
  
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 
  
  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    There is a comprehensive <Link LinkEnd="links">Links section</Link> that 
    has references to some topics not touched on in the main body of the 
    Document itself.

<Sect2>
<Title>What's New</Title>
<para>
 1.71: Add info on the IteX PCI ADSL modem only.

</para>
<para>
 1.7: Added comments on ISDN line filters being different than POTS, 
 and other additions related to ADSL over ISDN in various places. Add another
 supported modem: Eci Hi Focus ADSL Modem (and various related chipsets).
 Removed the 'Linux Friendly ISP' section. The landscape has changed much
 since this section was started. Back then there were few options for DSL in
 many places, and all too often a non-compatible modem was the only thing
 available. Also, the advent of microfilters and self-installation has helped
 with the <quote>do-it-yourselfer</quote> approach, giving everybody more
 freedom. Then, maintaining this number of links was a PITA too. I still
 encourage new subscribers to shop their local markets if there are options.
 Many large ISPs and telcos have very poor ideas of what an Internet
 connection is and restrict severely what you can do with Linux. Or at least
 try to ;-) Updated LDP links to tldp.org (from linuxdoc.org).
</para>
<para>
 1.6: Several new Linux Friendly ISPs. Clarification on 
 problems with alarm systems. Minor touch ups to other sections, and fix some 
 broken links (never ending job :).

</para>
<para>
 1.5: New Tuning sub-section using <application>iproute</application>. Hot
 stuff! Other additions to the Tuning section. A few new ISPs. Alcatel
 SpeedTouch USB section updates. Thanks to Alex Bennee for clarifying things.
 Other minor updates to FAQ, Glossary and Tuning.

</para>

<para>
 1.4: A few new and updated URLs, and catch ups. The Alcatel USB modem section
 is revamped. A few new ISPs.

</para>

<Para>
 Version 1.3: Updates to the SpeedTouch USB HOWTO in the appendix.
 Minor update to PPPoE section, and two new Linux Friendly ISPs. A feeble 
 attempt to make the document a little less U.S.-centric. Various minor 
 updates.
</Para>

<Para>
 Version 1.2 adds PPTP configuration section for Alcatel ethernet modems.
 Also, added are two additional sections in the <Quote>Tuning</Quote> section
 for the TCP Receive window, and ADSL/DMT interleaving. And the big news is
 the release of open source drivers for the Alcatel USB modem as of March
 2001. There is an Alcatel SpeedTouch USB mini HOWTO in the <Link
 LinkEnd="SpeedtouchUSB">appendix</Link> by Chris Jones. A number of 
 miscellaneous updates as well.
 
 </Para>

<Para>
 Version 1.1 included quite a few minor corrections, updates, 
 and additions. Not much that is substantially new. There are finally two
 Linux compatible DSL PCI modems from Xpeed. The drivers are now in the kernel
 2.2.18 source (not ported to 2.4 as of this writing 05/23/02).
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Version .99 addresses some of the many changes that have occurred since the
 original ADSL mini HOWTO was published. Originally, ADSL was the primary DSL
 technology being deployed, but more and more some of the other DSL flavors
 are entering the picture -- IDSL, SDSL, G.Lite, and RADSL. Thus the renaming
 from <Quote>ADSL mini HOWTO</Quote> to the <Quote>DSL HOWTO</Quote>. There
 have been many other changes in DSL technology as well. PPPoE/A encapsulation
 has become more and more common as many ISPs are jumping on this bandwagon.

<Title>Conventions, Usage and Terminology</Title>

<Para>
 For the sake of simplicity and sanity, let's clarify some of the terminology
 that we will be using in this document, so that we are all on the same page.
 While many of the definitions below are not always 100% technically correct,
 they are close enough for our purposes here. In fast moving technologies like
 DSL, there are so many <Quote>ifs, ands, and buts</Quote> that it is
 difficult to say anything with any degree of certainty and have it stick. And
 there are exceptions to almost every rule. And sometimes exceptions to the
 exceptions. We will be dealing with generalities to a large degree here,
 please keep that in mind. 

</Para>

<Para>
 <ItemizedList>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <Quote>DSL</Quote> will be used to refer to the entire family of DSL
   technologies now available  -- ADSL, SDSL, IDSL, RADSL, etc. ADSL still
   seems to be the most prevalent at this time, but the others are being
   deployed as well. Where it is important to differentiate one type of
   DSL from another, the full proper name will be used: e.g. RADSL. xDSL is
   also commonly used to refer to the various DSL technologies as a group, but
   we will be using just <Quote>DSL</Quote> here.

  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   The term <Quote>telco</Quote> here refers to any potential DSL provider.
   This includes the ILECs (Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers), a.k.a. the old
   guard phone companies or state run phone companies, and where the
   monopolies now have competition, the CLECs (Competitive Local Exchange
   Carriers), or independent providers such as Covad in the U.S.

  </Para>
 </ListItem>
 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <Quote>CO</Quote> is the telco acronym for <Quote>Central Office</Quote>.
   Traditionally this is a building where one end of your phone line
   physically terminates. The other end terminates at your home, office, or
   wherever. It will be used here to refer to the telco end termination point,
   regardless of whether it is a traditional Central Office building or
   another, smaller, remote structure or device.
  
  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <Quote>Loop</Quote> is telco speak for <Quote>phone line</Quote>.
   Essentially, you should think of your loop as one dedicated pair of copper
   wires that run uninterrupted from your residence or office directly to the
   CO. This is perhaps an oversimplification, but will serve our purposes. DSL
   availability, and signal quality, is tied directly to the characteristics
   of your physical line -- or <Quote>loop</Quote> as they say.
   
  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <quote>POTS</quote> is the acronym for Plain Old Telephone Service. In other
   words, traditional, non-digital devices like analog phones, faxes and answering
   machines. ISDN is used for DSL in some areas, so POTS is not the only way 
   to piggy-back DSL. But certainly the most common in many places.

  </Para>
 </ListItem>
 
 <ListItem>

   <quote>NID</quote>, or Network Interface Device, is the small telco 
   housing that is often typically attached to the outside wall of your house,

   elsewhere depending on the phone company. This may variously also be
   referred to as <quote>ONI</quote>, <quote>SNI</quote>, <quote>NIU</quote>,
   <Quote>TNI</Quote> or other creative telco acronyms. It represents the
   <quote>demarcation</quote> point that divides the customer's realm of

   <Quote>DSLAM</Quote> is the sophisticated hardware device in the telco's CO
   where your phone line physically terminates, and thus makes DSL happen.
   Increasingly, telcos are making use of smaller devices like the
   <Quote>mini-RAM</Quote> in remote locations. We'll use <Quote>DSLAM</Quote>
   here as a catch-all for any device that enables DSL service from a telco. 
   These are now being manufactured by a number of companies.

 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <Quote>Modem</Quote> will be used to refer to the end user device that
   enables a DSL connection. Your <quote>modem</quote> is connected to the
   telco's DSLAM in the CO via your copper loop. When they are
   <Quote>talking</Quote> DSL to each other, they are in <Quote>sync</Quote>.
   Without <Quote>sync</Quote>, no connection to your ISP is possible. 
  
  </Para>
   
  <Para> 
   <Quote>Modem</Quote> is indeed the correct terminology since there is
   MOdulation and DEModulation of the signal, even though it doesn't 
   resemble an analog 56K modem like many of us have had before. These modems
   incorporate other features too -- so they are more than just a
   <quote>modem</quote>. Some ISPs and manufacturers may be marketing simply
   <Quote>routers</Quote>, <Quote>bridges</Quote>, or even
   <Quote>brouters</Quote> for this purpose. These are essentially DSL modems
   with enhancements. A compatible <Quote>modem</Quote> of some kind is the
   minimum hardware requirement at the customer's end of the connection. The
   most commonly supplied modem is actually a combination bridge and modem.
  </Para>
  <para>
   One distinction here may be where ADSL is provided over ISDN lines. In this
   case, the term <quote>modem</quote> is not appropriate and the only
   physical difference is that the ISDN Network Terminator (NT), is equipped
   to handle DSL, but is still an NT. In any case, for brevity, we will take
   license here to refer to all such devices as <quote>modems</quote>.
  </para>

  <Para>
   Unless stated otherwise, we will also be assuming the <Quote>modem</Quote>
   has an ethernet interface, and will connect to a standard ethernet Network
   Card (NIC). This is far and away the most prevalent configuration for Linux 
   users, at least until more Linux drivers are available for PCI and USB
   modems. USB modem are quite popular otherwise, because they are
   <quote>plug 'n play</quote>, and arguably less expensive.
 
  </Para>

  <Para>
   It is worth noting that <Quote>routers</Quote> as supplied by DSL providers
   are typically modem/router combination devices. In our context,
   <Quote>router</Quote> will refer to these devices as such. There are also
   SOHO broadband routers available that are only dedicated routers and lack
   the modem functionality. 
 
  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   Previous versions of this document referred to the modem as an 
   <Quote>ANT</Quote> (ADSL Network Termination). While this may be
   technically correct terminology, it is not used by ISPs, manufacturers,
   telcos, or most users to any extent.  The <Quote>modem</Quote> will be just
   called a modem, regardless of whatever other features it may incorporate (i.e.
   router, bridge, etc.).

  PPPoX will be used to refer to PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet) and PPPoA

<Para>
 Before actually ordering service, there are several things you may want to
 explore. Please note, that there are many ways any given telco might 
 decide to handle qualification and installation procedures. Much of what 
 is described in this section, is how it is commonly done in the U.S. 
 
</Para>



<!--   ~~~~~       New Section      ~~~~~     -->
<Sect2>
<Title>Pre-Installation</Title>

<Para>
 In many parts of the world, there is no choice on who you get DSL from: your
 friendly local telco, of course! They own the copper wires, and thus they 
 hold all the cards. 
</Para>

<Para>
 However, in the U.S. de-regulation has opened this up somewhat. Beyond the
 obvious consideration of price, there are reasons to investigate which
 alternate providers may be offering DSL services in your area. The large
 Telephone companies are everywhere, and may advertise the most. But
 increasingly smaller ISPs and independents are getting into the act. This has 
 created some diversity in the DSL marketplace. A good thing of course, but
 possibly creating a little confusion too. Conversely, in areas where there 
 is only one choice, then we have no choice but to accept whatever service 
 is being offered.

</Para>

<Para>
 If your telco has a monopoly on phone service and DSL, you may skip the 
 rest of this section. And probably the next few sections. They will probably 
 control the installation and qualification processes, and you just wait 
 for them to get finished.
</Para>

<Para>
 Not all DSL services are alike. Just because two local companies are offering 
 <Quote>ADSL</Quote>, does not mean that necessarily there is much in common
 at all. In fact, there are potentially a number of factors that make one ADSL
 provider's service significantly different from another's. Some things to

   Linux friendly, Linux hostile, or Linux agnostic? This is not as much of

   Quality of service. How is news, mail, etc.? News particularly seems

 <Link LinkEnd="cproviders">choosing a provider</Link>.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Once you have chosen a provider, and ordered service, the next step is for
 the telco to <Quote>qualify</Quote> your loop. This essentially means testing
 your line to make sure it can handle the DSL signal, and possibly what level
 of service may be available to you. This may take some time, especially if
 the telco encounters problems with the loop. If no problems are found during
 this phase, then possibly there will be a one to three week wait for the
 installation. YMMV.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 After the telco has qualified the loop and readied their end of the
 connection, the next step is installation of the necessary components at the
 customer's end of the connection: wiring modifications, splitter or filters,
 and, of course the modem and any necessary software.

<Sect2>
<Title>Installation Options -- Self Install or Not</Title>

<Para>
 You may or may not have a choice on how the installation is done, or who
 does it. This is totally at the discretion of the provider. In much of the
 world, this is done by the telco, and there is little flexibility. Many
 providers in the U.S. offer a <Quote>self install</Quote> option where you do
 all the work. In this scenario, the provider will send a kit in order to save
 them from sending a tech, and thus reducing cost. Typically, self install
 kits will include microfilters for the POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service)
 or ISDN (where ADSL over ISDN is used) phone jacks, the modem (and
 maybe a NIC), and a CDROM with drivers, etc. on it. In some cases, a splitter
 may be included instead of microfilters. In any case, some type of filtering
 is necessary on the non-DSL lines. If not the noise generated by the DSL
 signal may interfere with regula telco devices such as phones and answering
 machines.

</Para>

<Para>
 The other possibility is for the provider to do the installation. Again, this
 may be your only option. Obviously, the cost is higher here, but it may have
 the advantage of having a trained tech do any wiring. There is also a better
 chance of getting a <quote>splittered</quote> installation with this option
 (a good thing!). Another benefit is that if something is wrong with the line,
 or the telco has not provisioned the line properly, an on-site tech may be
 able to help sort out certain kinds of problems quickly. 
</Para>

<Para>
 The self-install kit should come with full instructions, regardless of whether
 the installation will be splittered or filtered. So we won't go into much
 detail on this aspect.
 
</Para>

<!--  ~  End Section  ~  -->




<!--   ~~~~~       New Section      ~~~~~     -->

<Sect2>
<Title>Wiring/Installation Options</Title>

<Para>
 There are various wiring schemes depending on how your service is being
 provided, who is providing it, and which DSL service is being provided. 
 If your telco is performing the installation, you may skip this section.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 <ItemizedList>
  
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    <Emphasis>Dedicated Line</Emphasis>. Some DSLs require a dedicated, or
    <Quote>dry</Quote>, wire pair, e.g. IDSL. This means a separate, physical
    line without dial-tone for DSL and Internet connectivity. Also, DSL
    services from CLECs (independent telcos like Covad), may use a
    dedicated line, depending on their line sharing agreement with the local 
    incumbent carrier. (Instead the CLEC will actually lease a loop from the
    ILEC.) On your end, this simply means using one of the unused wire pairs
    in the telco wire bundle, and connecting it to the DSL jack.
   
   </Para>
 </ListItem> 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <Emphasis>Shared Line with Splitter</Emphasis>. For DSLs like ADSL, that
   are provided over the same line as regular voice service, the signal
   must be filtered somehow so that voice services are not adversely effected.
   Installing a splitter splits the line into two pairs, and filters the DSL
   signal from one of them. This results in a inside wiring scheme where DSL
   goes to only one jack, and then regular voice type service to all other
   jacks. This is considered by many to be a better type of installation than
   <Quote>splitterless</Quote>, i.e. with microfilters instead. See below.
  
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   Splitters are available from various manufacturers and come in various
   shapes and sizes. Some are small enough to fit in the NID itself (sometimes
   called SNI, this is the telco phone box on the outside of your house),
   while others have a housing as large as the NID itself. Typically this is
   mounted near the NID, on the customer's side of the demarcation point.

  </Para>
 
 </ListItem> 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <Emphasis>Shared Line with Filters</Emphasis>. Again, for some DSLs that
   piggyback on the POTS (or ISDN) line, the signal must be filtered or split at some
   point. This is not necessary for g.lite or RADSL however. The other way of
   doing this is by placing RJ11 <Quote>microfilters</Quote> in each phone
   jack -- <Emphasis>except where the DSL modem will be</Emphasis>. These
   filters are relatively small, plug-in devices and remove the higher
   frequencies associated with DSL. This is obviously much easier since no
   tools or wiring is required. This is often what is included in self-install
   kits, and is often referred to as a <Quote>splitterless</Quote>
   installation. This is a very common approach in the U.S. Note that 
   in areas where ADSL over ISDN is provided, filtering is required 
   also, but the filters themselves are quite different and are not
   interchangeable with POTS filters!
  </Para>
  <Para>
   Similar microfilters are sometimes used by some telcos to reduce the
   excessive <Quote>whine</Quote> on the line that is produced by some modems.
   This is a little different approach as the filter is put on the same 
   jack as the modem.
  </Para>
 
 </ListItem> 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <Emphasis>Shared Line, Splitterless and Filterless</Emphasis>. Some newer
   DSLs, like G.Lite, have no adverse effect on regular POTS devices and thus
   require no filters or splitters. This would seem to be the wave of the
   future. Just plug and play. Though still not very common.

 The first step will be to wire up the connections from your provider. Identify
 the line on which service will be installed, and the locations of your
 splitter and DSL jack(s). (For perhaps a better wiring scheme, see the 
 Homerun section immediately below.)
</Para>

<Para>
 Be aware that typical telco wire has more than one pair per bundle. Often,
 two pairs, but sometimes more. If you have but one phone line, the other
 pair(s) are unused. This makes them available for use with wiring for DSL.
 Wire pairs are color coded for easy identification. SDSL and IDSL require a
 dedicated, or <Quote>dry</Quote>, pair. If an unused pair is available, then
 no real re-wiring is required. It is just a matter of re-wiring an existing
 jack for the correct pair of wires, and attaching the modem.

<Para>
 The optimum method of wiring for the DSL modem is sometimes
 called a <Quote>homerun</Quote>. It is called this because it is one,
 straight shot from the splitter to the modem's DSL jack. What this does is
 bypass the existing inside wiring altogether, and any problems that might be
 lurking there -- like a corroded connection somewhere on a voice jack. Inside
 wiring deficiencies can cause a degradation of the DSL signal. 

</Para> 
 
<Para> 
 This also allows you to route the cable to avoid any potential
 RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) sources. RFI anywhere in the
 circuit can be a DSL killer. Routing the cable away from items that
 may have electric motors, transformers, power supplies, high
 intensity lighting fixtures, dimmer switches and such, is a smart way
 to go. And you are also less likely to have a failing microfilter
 cause problems -- one potential point of failure instead of several. You can
 also use a better grade of cable such as CAT 5.

</Para>

<Para>
 If your existing installation is <quote>splitterless</quote> (i.e. using
 microfilters) now, converting to a homerun will entail purchasing a splitter.
 And, of course, will also mean some new wiring will need to be run.
 Microfilters also add to the effective loop length -- as much as 700 ft per
 filter in some cases! So if you have several microfilters installed, and your
 sync rate or distance is marginal, eliminating these filters may result in a
 significant improvement.

</Para>

<Para>
 The splitter will typically consist of two parts, the splitter and a small
 outdoor housing. Mount the splitter and accompanying housing per the telco's
 instructions at the Network Interface Device (NID) point (also sometimes
 called the SNI or ONI), usually the side of your house where the phone line
 is located. Put it on your side of the NID. The phone company may need
 to access the splitter for maintenance, so its advisable to locate it on the
 outside where they can get at it, but outside is not absolutely
 necessary.

</Para> 
 
<Para> 
 The wire bundle should have at least two separate wire pairs. The splitter
 takes one pair, and separates the signal onto two pairs. One pair in the
 bundle will then go to all phone jacks, and the other to the modem's DSL wall
 jack. So connect the incoming telco line to the LINE side of the splitter.
 Then wire the inside pair for your telephone to the VOICE, and your inside
 wire pair for the modem to DATA. 

</Para>


<Para>
 <Emphasis remap="bf">Checkstep </Emphasis> At this point, you should be able
 to pull dial tone off the voice side of the splitter. If this doesn't work,
 then you've wired it wrong. You can also plug the modem into the test jack in
 the NID box (most should have this). Plug in the modem's power cord, and
 if the line is provisioned correctly, you should <Quote>sync</Quote> in less

 so the one does not interfere with the other. Common microfilters tend not to
 work because most alarm boxes use a different size jack. Filters are now
 available just for alarm boxes, though traditionally this has been handled
 with a splitter type installation.

<Title>Installing an Ethernet Modem</Title>

<Para>
 To install, connect the modem's (or router's) power cord, and connect
 the phone line between the DSL wall jack and the modem. This cable should be
 provided. If not, a regular phone cord will suffice. With the ethernet
 interfaced modems, you may also connect the ethernet cable between the NIC
 and the modem (but not really necessary at this point just to verify an 
 ethernet modem is working).

</Para>

<Para>
 <Emphasis remap="bf">Checkstep </Emphasis> At this point, verify that
 the modem syncs with the telco's DSLAM signal. Most modems have a
 green LED that lights up when the signal is good, and red or orange
 if not in sync. The modem's manual will have more details on the
 LEDs. If it doesn't sync, then check your wiring, or make sure that
 the DSL signal is being sent. Do this by calling your telco and
 verifying they have activated the service. Or by testing the modem at
 the test jack on the NID (see above). Note that having dial tone
 on the line does NOT confirm the presence of the DSL data signal. And
 vice versa -- perfectly possible to have dial tone and no DSL, or DSL
 and no dial tone. There should also be no static or noise on the
 voice line when everything is installed and functioning properly.

<Title>Installing the Ethernet Network Card (NIC)</Title>

<Para>
 Ethernet modems will, of course, require an ethernet network card.
 If you haven't already done so, install the NIC in your Linux machine,
 configure the kernel, or load modules, etc., etc. This is sometimes the
 biggest stumbling block -- getting the NIC recognized and working. See the
 various Linux references for doing this, such as the <Ulink
 url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Ethernet-HOWTO.html">Ethernet
 HOWTO</Ulink> for more information. Also, see the <Link
 LinkEnd="tuning">Troubleshooting Section</Link> below. This is certainly
 something you could conceivably do ahead of time if you already have the NIC.

</Para>

<Para>
 Be sure the RJ45 cable between the NIC and the modem is now connected. You
 can <quote>hot plug</quote> this cable, meaning there is no need to power
 down to do this.

 The physical installation of a USB modem is similar to an ethernet modem.
 There is no ethernet card necessary obviously. So connect the phone

 USB modems will require vendor and model specific drivers in order to sync

<Title>Bridged vs PPPoX Networks</Title>

<Para>
 Before we get too far into the final stages of installing and
 configuring our system, let's look at how various DSL ISPs set up
 their networks. It will be very important for you to know how your ISP does
 this, as there is more than one possibility and the steps involved are quite
 different for each. This may not be the kind of thing the ISP is advertising,
 and since you are not using Windows, you may not have access to the setup
 disk that the ISP provides. If you're not sure, ask the ISP's tech support
 staff, or better, find other knowledgable users of the same service.

</Para>

<Para>
 To muddy the waters even more, some ISPs may be offering more than one kind
 of service (over and above the various bit rate plans). Example: Verizon 
 (formerly Bell Atlantic) originally offered static IPs with a Bridged
 connection. Now all new installs use PPPoE with dynamic IPs. For installation
 and configuration purposes, this is very different.

</Para>

<Para>
 The two most common DSL network implementations are Bridged/DHCP and PPPoX.
 Both have mechanisms for obtaining an IP address and other related networking
 configuration details so we shouldn't have to worry about this. But there are 
 indeed other, less common, means of connecting. Our job will be finding the
 right client, and doing what we have to, to get it up and running. The most 
 common ones are discussed below.
 
</Para>


<Para>
 <Emphasis>Important!</Emphasis> You need to know beforehand how your ISP is
 setup for connecting to his network. To re-iterate, the two main
 possibilities are Bridged/DHCP and PPPoE. These are mutually exclusive
 implementations. And there are indeed other possibilities as well. So you will
 need to know exactly what this is beforehand. And it must be the right one or
 you will waste a lot of time and effort. You cannot choose which one either.
 It is a matter of how the ISP is doing his network. Note that PPPoE can run
 over Bridged networks, so just knowing whether you are Bridged or not, is not
 necessarily good enough. If your provider is giving you a router, there is a
 good chance that the router's firmware will handle all of this for you. 

</Para>

<Para>
 If you are subscribing with one of the Baby Bells in the U.S., you can
 count on that being PPPoE, and thus you will need a PPPoE client.

<Sect3>
<Title>Bridged/DHCP</Title>

<Para>
 In the good old days of a year or two ago, purely <Quote>Bridged</Quote>
 connections were the norm. PPPoE had not been invented yet. This type of
 network puts you on a local subnet just like a big LAN. You are exposed to
 much of the local subnet traffic, especially ARP and broadcast traffic. The
 typical means of authenticating in this set up, is via DHCP. 
</Para>

<Para>
 DHCP is a standard, established networking protocol for obtaining an IP
 address and other important network parameters (e.g.  nameservers). This is a
 standard, well documented networking scheme and is very easy to set up
 from the end user's perspective. It is also a very stable connection. You
 can actually unplug the modem for say 10 minutes, plug it back in, let it
 re-sync, and the connection is still there -- same IP and everything. 

</Para>

</Sect3>

<!--  ~  End Section  ~  -->



<!--   ~~~~~       New Section      ~~~~~     -->

<Sect3>
<Title>PPPoX</Title>

<Para>
 The main alternative now is PPPoX, meaning either PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet)
 or PPPoA (PPP over ATM, aka PPPoATM). Both of these related protocols are
 currently being deployed, but at the moment, PPPoE seems to be the more
 common of the two. PPPoX is a relative newcomer, and, as the name implies, is
 a variation of Point-to-Point Protocol that has been adapted specifically for
 DSL networks.
</Para>

<Para>
 There are several PPPoE clients for Linux (<Link LinkEnd="pppoe">see
 below</Link>). PPPoX simulates a dialup type environment. The user is
 authenticated by user id and password which is passed to a RADIUS server,
 just like good ol' dialup PPP. A routable IP address, and other related
 information, is returned to the client. Of course, no actual dialing takes
 place. The mechanics of how this is handled, will vary from client to client,
 so best to RTFM closely. Typically you will set up configuration files like
 <Filename>pap-secrets</FileName>, etc. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 It is worth noting that PPPoE will also work on non-ethernet devices like USB, 
 provided the correct drivers are installed.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 From the ISPs perspective, PPP is much easier to maintain and troubleshoot.
 From the end user's perspective, it is often more work to set up, often uses
 more CPU, and the connection is maybe not as stable. So anyway, this seems to
 be the coming trend. Many of the large telcos around the world, especially
 the RBOCs (Baby Bells) in the U.S., have committed to PPPoX already. Setting
 up a PPPoX connection is completely different from setting up a bridged/DHCP
 connection.

<Title>ATM</Title>

<Para>
 Since the traffic on the wire from the DSLAM to the modem is typically ATM, a
 raw ATM connection would seem to make sense. While possible, this is rare, if
 it exists at all in the U.S, and would require a modem in addition to a PCI
 ATM card, such as the Efficient Networks 3010. Recent 2.4 kernels 
 do have ATM support. (See the <Link LinkEnd="links">Links section</Link> for
 more information.)

<Title>Configuring the WAN Interface</Title>

<Para>
 The most common configuration is a DSL modem in <Quote>bridging</Quote> mode.
 Both PPPoX and DHCP can use this setup. In this scenario, the WAN interface
 typically means your NIC. This is where your system meets the outside world.
 (If you have a router see <Link LinkEnd="router">below</Link> for router
 specific instructions.) So essentially we will be configuring the NIC,
 typically <Quote>eth0</Quote> since it is an ethernet interface. 
 
</Para> 
 
<Para>
 With PPPoX, once the connection comes up, there will be a
 <Quote>ppp0</Quote>, or similar, interface, just like dialup. This will
 become the WAN interface once the connection to the PPP server is up, but for
 configuration purposes we will we be concerned with <Quote>eth0</Quote>
 initially.

<Title>Static IP Configuration</Title>

<Para>
 A <Quote>static</Quote> IP address is an IP that is guaranteed not to change.
 This is the preferred way to go for those wanting to host a domain or run
 some type of public server, but is not available from all ISPs. Note that
 while there are some noteworthy benefits to having a static IP, the
 disadvantage is that is more difficult to remain <quote>invisible</quote>. It
 is harder to hide from those with malicious intentions. Skip this section if
 you do not have a static IP, or if you have a router, and the router will be
 assigned the static IP.

</Para>

<Para>
 Configure the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server
 information as provided by the ISP. Each Linux Distribution (Redhat, Debian,
 Slackware, SuSE, etc.) has a different way of doing this, so check on your
 distro's docs on this. Each may have their own tools for this. Redhat has
 <Command>netcfg</Command> for example. You can also do this manually using
 the <Command>ifconfig </Command> and <Command>route</Command> commands. See

<Sect3>
<Title>Bridged/DHCP Configuration</Title>

<Para>
 ISPs that have Bridged networks typically use DHCP to assign an IP addresses,
 and authenticate the user. All distributions come with one or more DHCP
 clients. <Command>dhcpcd</Command> seems to be the most common.
 <Command>pump</Command> comes with Redhat based distributions as of Redhat
 6.0. The DHCP client will obtain an IP <Quote>lease</Quote> from the ISP's
 server as well as other related information: gateway address, DNS servers,
 and network mask. The lease will be <Quote>renewed</Quote> at regular
 intervals according to the ISP's configuration. 

</Para>

<Para>
 You will want the DHCP client started on boot, so use your distribution's
 means of doing this. There generally is little to configure with DHCP as it
 is fairly straightforward and easy to use. You may need to tell it which
 interface to listen on if the NIC is something other than
 <Quote>eth0</Quote>. You can also start it from the command line to get
 started. See the respective man pages for more. 
  
</Para>

<Para>
 Unless you have a static IP, the ISP will need some way to know who you are
 when you connect. There are two ways this authentication process is
 accomplished with DHCP. The first and most common method is via the MAC (or
 hardware) address of the network device. Typically this would be the NIC. The
 MAC address is a unique identifier and can be found among the boot messages,
 or with <Command>ifconfig</Command>, and looks something like 
 <Literal>00:50:04:C2:19:BC</Literal>.  You will need to give the ISP the MAC
 address before your first connection. 
</Para> 
 
<Para> 
 The other DHCP authentication method is via an assigned hostname. In this
 case, the ISP will have provided you with this information. Your DHCP client
 will need to pass this information to the server in order for you to connect. 
 Both <Command>dhcpcd</Command> and <Command>pump</Command> accept the
 <Quote>-h</Quote> command line option for this purpose. See the client's man
 page, or your distribution's documentation, for specifics.

</Para>

<note><title>Note</title>
 <Para> 
  If your ISP uses MAC address authentication, and you change your network
  device (e.g. NIC), you will need to register the new address with the ISP or
  you won't be able to connect.

  to communicate. A typical symptom would be the failure of some web pages to
  load properly, and possibly other annoying problems. You may need to also
  set the MTU for interfaces on any masqueraded LAN connections MTU to 1452.
  This does not apply to PPPoA, bridged, or routed configurations, just PPPoE!
  See rfc2923 for a technical explanation.
 </Para>
</Note>

 
<Para>
 Actually, for PPPoE the real setting should be at least 8 bytes less (the
 extra PPPoE protocol overhead) than any interface between you and the
 ultimate destination. All routers normally would be set to 1500, thus 1492 is
 correct from your end. But, it may happen that somewhere a router is
 configured at a lower setting, and this can cause problems, especially
 with web pages loading, and other traffic failures. The way to test this is
 to keep dropping the MTU until things 'work'.

<Sect3 id="pppoa">
<Title>PPPoA</Title>

<Para>
 PPPoA (PPPoATM, or PPP over ATM) is a cleaner solution than PPPoE since most
 of the work is done in hardware, and since the raw DSL traffic is ATM. There
 is no user space client necessary to manage the connection as with PPPoE, and
 the additional ethernet protocol layer is not required. Authentication is
 still the same: user id and password to connect, but the mechanics are
 different since no ethernet encapsulation takes place.

</Para>

<Para>
 PPPoA is either done completely in hardware or is implemented as a device
 specific driver. There is no such thing as a generic PPPoA software client
 like there is for PPPoE. There is an ATM patch for 2.2 kernels, support for
 ATM in the 2.4.x kernel, and a project based on the Efficient Networks 3010,
 as well as other ATM cards. The ATM on Linux homepage is here: <Ulink
 URL="http://linux-atm.sourceforge.net/">
 http://linux-atm.sourceforge.net/</Ulink>. And even more info is at <Ulink
 URL="http://www.sfgoth.com/~mitch/linux/atm/pppoatm/">
 http://www.sfgoth.com/~mitch/linux/atm/pppoatm/</Ulink> from the kernel
 developer of this project. Existing PPPoA implementations are hardware/driver
 based, and Linux PPPoA modem drivers are scarce as hen's
 teeth at this time. The above modem does not seem to be available through
 normal retail channels. This may be a problem, if this is the only protocol
 an ISP delivers, and an external modem that supports PPPoA is not available.

</Para>

<Para>
 If PPPoA is your ISP's only option, you might consider one of the
 router/modems that can handle PPPoA connections, and let the hardware handle
 everything.

<Title>PPTP/PPPoA with Alcatel Ethernet Modems</Title>

<Para>
 Alcatel SpeedTouch Home ethernet modems (supersedes the Alcatel 1000) 
 support both bridged and PPPoA connections. The modem itself handles the
 PPPoA protocol internally. When in PPTP/PPPoA mode (as opposed to RFC1483 bridging
 mode), Linux will connect to the modem via PPTP (MS VPN). The Linux PPTP
 homepage is <Ulink

 and works well with this modem. 
<!-- 
 RPMs can be found as

 In addition to installing pptp, your kernel must also have support for PPP.
</Para>

<Para>
 The modem has internal configuration pages than can be reached by pointing
 a browser to the default IP address of http://10.0.0.138. (You will of course
 have to have your NIC set up for a 10.0.0.0 network with similar IP such 
 as 10.0.0.1, in order to reach the modem's configuration pages.) For PPPoA,
 the connection type is 'PPTP'. You will have to get the other settings from
 your provider if the defaults do not work. Settings such as 'VPI/VCI' and
 'encapsulation' can vary from provider to provider. Of course, if the modem 
 is coming from your provider, all this should be already configured.

<Sect3 id="router">
<Title>Modem/Router Configuration</Title>

<Para>
 Some ISPs are providing <Quote>routers</Quote> as the connection device.
 Essentially these are mini routers with built in modems. These are all
 ethernet based devices too, so Linux should be good to go here as well.
 Again, a compatible, working NIC should be all that is required to make this
 work.

</Para>
 
<Para> 
 A <Quote>router</Quote> has many advantages. The better ones can handle the
 connection management, IP encapsulation, and authentication, as well as
 providing a means of segregating your LAN from outside traffic, and possibly
 other features too. In short they can do it all. One big advantage is that
 they can handle whatever protocols your ISP requires in order to connect. 

</Para> 
 
<Para>
 If the ISP is requiring PPPoX, then this makes life a little easier since you
 will not have to install or configure any additional software just to use
 their network. The modem's firmware will handle this. The downside is that
 most of these do not have the flexibility of a Linux router, or other
 software solution. Of course, you could set up a Linux router behind the
 router, and have the best of both worlds. The ones with more and better
 features are also going to cost significantly more.

</Para>

<Para>
 While the physical installation of a router is very similar to the modem
 installation (see above), the router configuration itself is different
 since your first <Quote>hop</Quote> will be the router's interface and not
 the ISP's gateway. Routers will actually have two interfaces -- one that you
 connect to from the LAN side, and one that connects to your ISP on the WAN
 side. Your point of exposure here is the WAN interface of the router. 

</Para>

<Para> 
 The router will also have a pre-configured, private IP address that you will
 connect to from the LAN side. This will be your gateway. The public IP
 address will be assigned to the WAN side interface. Typically these devices
 also act as DHCP servers for the LAN side as well. So possibly all you have
 to do is to start a DHCP client such as <Command>dhcpcd</Command> or
 <Command>pump</Command> (Redhat based distros) to get up and running. Just
 make sure the modem/router is syncing first. The appropriate steps and
 configuration should be in the owner's manual, or available from your
 provider. 

</Para>

<Para>
 If you are a PPPoX customer, and the router is handling this part of the
 connection, then you will have to configure at least your user id and
 password before connecting. If a Bridged/DHCP customer, you should just have
 to activate DHCP on the router, and possibly register the MAC (hardware
 address) of the router with your provider. Some routers have <Quote>MAC
 cloning</Quote> which means that they will report the MAC address of the
 attached NIC. If static IP, then you will have to configure this as well.

</Para>

<Para>
 If you need to access the router directly, you will need to know the
 manufacturer's default setting for its IP address. See the owner's manual, or
 ask your provider. You will then have to set your NIC's interface to the same
 network as the router. For instance, if the router has an IP of 10.0.0.1, set
 your interface's address to 10.0.0.2 (typically eth0), and netmask to
 255.0.0.0. 

</Para>


<para>
 <Screen>

 # ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.2 up netmask 255.0.0.0
 # route add -net 10.0.0.0
 $ ping 10.0.0.1

 </Screen>
</para>
 
<Para> 
 If everything is in working order, the router should respond to pings. How to
 configure this permanently will vary from distro to distro. So check your
 distribution's documentation. Now you should be able to ping the
 modem/router, and, if all is well, beyond. Then use telnet or a web browser
 to do any further configuration of the router.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Even if the ISP is not offering any router options, there are quite a few
 available from third party manufacturers such as Netgear, Linksys, Cisco,
 Zyxel, Cayman, Alcatel and others. These will have all the features already
 mentioned and maybe more. Just make sure it matches your provider's DSL. This
 is one good way around the PPPoX bugaboo.
 
</Para>

<Caution>
 <Para>
  Some manufacturers may be marketing these as having <Quote>firewall</Quote>
  capabilities. In some cases, this amounts to nothing more than basic NAT
  (Network Address Translation or masquerading). Not a full, true firewall by
  most measures. Be sure to read the fine print before buying and make sure you
  know how much real firewalling is included.

    Turn off any daemons and services that aren't absolutely essential, and

   <Para>
    Many distributions start some well known services by default. You may not

 You will loose 10-20% of the modem's attainable sync rate to networking
 overheads (TCP, ATM, ethernet). So a 1500 Kbps connection, is only going to
 realize about 1100-1300 Kbps or so of real world throughput. No tweaking is
 going to change the built-in protocol overheads. Also, if your
 service is capped at a lesser speed by your provider, then you can't get
 above that speed no matter what. <Emphasis>AND</Emphasis> -- that there are
 numerous variables that can effect your loop/signal quality, and subsequently
 your speed (aka sync rate). Some of these may be beyond your control. 
 
</Para>

<para>
 But there are a few things that you might want to look at.

<!--   ~~~~~       New Section      ~~~~~     -->

<Sect3>
<Title>TCP Receive Window</Title>

<Para>
 For many of us, a default Linux installation is going to give something close
 to optimum performance. Windows 9x users often get a big boost by increasing
 their TCP Receive Window (RWIN). But this is because it is too small to start
 with. This is just not the case with Linux where the default value is 32KB. 

</Para> 


<Para> 
 The exception here is if you have to routinely deal with a high latency
 connection. For instance, if your provider has a satellite uplink that is
 consistently adding unusual latency (250ms or greater?). Then a larger
 TCP Window will likely help. For more on TCP Receive Window and related
 issues, look at <Ulink
 URL="http://www.psc.edu/networking/perf_tune.html">http://www.psc.edu/networking/perf_tune.html</Ulink>. 

</Para>

<Para>
 The Receive Window is a buffer that helps control the flow of data. If 
 set too low, it can be a bottleneck and restrict throughput. The optimum 
 value for this depends completely on your bandwidth and latency. Latency being
 what you would find as average roundtrip time (RTT) based on
 <Emphasis>your</Emphasis> typical destinations and conditions. This can be
 determined with <Command>ping</Command>. For example, the Linux default of
 32KB is acceptable up to speeds of 2 Mbps and a typical latency of 125ms or so,
 or 1.0 Mbps and latency of 250ms. Setting this value too high can also
 adversely effect throughput, so don't over do it.

</Para>

<Para>
 An example courtesy of Juha Saarinen of New Zealand:
 
</Para>

<Blockquote>
 <Para> 
The commonly used formula for working out the tcp buffer is the
<Quote>bandwidth delay product</Quote> one:
</para>
<Para>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffer size = Bandwidth (bits/s) * RTT (seconds)
</Para>
<Para>
In my case, I have roughly 8Mbps downstream, but the ATM network can only
support ~3.5Mbps sustained. I'm far away from the rest of the world, so to
squeeze in a sufficient amount of 1,500 byte packets, with average RTTs of
250ms, I should probably have a buffer of (3,500,000/8)*.25 = 106KB. (I've
got 128KB at the moment, which works fine.)
</Para>

</Blockquote>

<Para>
 The Receive Window can be dynamically set in the /proc filesystem. This
 requires entering a value that is twice the desired buffer size:

</Para>

<para>
 <screen>

 #echo 262144 > /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default 
 #echo 262144 > /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max

 </screen>
</para>

<Para>
The above example actually sets the value to 128K. The Send Window can also 
be set, but is not as likely to be a limiting factor on DSL connections as 
the Receive Window:

</Para>

<para>
 <screen>
 
 #echo 262144 > /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default 
 #echo 262144 > /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max

 These values can also be set using the <Command>sysctl</Command> command. See
 the man page.

<Title>Interleaving</Title>

<Para>
 <Quote>Interleaving</Quote> is an error control mechanism of ADSL with DMT
 line encoding. DMT is now the standard for ADSL, and is by far and away the
 most prevalent form of ADSL. Interleaving buffers the raw data and corrects
 errors on the fly at the DSLAM. This can significantly help marginal loops
 that may be prone to line errors. The downside is that this buffering also adds
 significant latency to the connection. So for those with reasonable quality
 lines, interleaving is of no real benefit, and may actually add unnecessary 
 latency.

</Para>

<Para>
 Interleaving is an adjustable parameter and can be turned on or off by the
 telco. Many telcos seem to like to have this on by default, since it probably 
 reduces tech support calls in those cases where it does help stabilize a line. 
 But everyone else pays a price. 
 
</Para>

<Para> 
 How to know if your line is interleaved or not, and how to change it? Good
 question. Generally speaking, if your first hop or two on a traceroute is 
 less than 25ms or so, you can pretty much figure that interleaving is off. 
 But there may be other factors such as how far away those hops actually are.
 Unless your modem accurately reports this, the only other real way to know is
 to talk to someone at the telco. This may prove easier said than done.

<title>TCP Bottlenecks</title>
<para>
 DSL connections may suffer performance degradations under certain
 circumstances. Thankfully, Linux has very robust and flexible networking
 tools to help us deal with these.
</para> 

<para>
 One such common situation is where traffic bottlenecks are created whenever
 data from a fast network segment hits a slower one. Such as ethernet hitting
 a DSL modem/router. This can cause short term traffic backlogs, known as
 <quote>queues</quote> in the device. Queuing can result in degraded
 performance, particularly for interactive protocols (like telnet or ssh) and
 streaming protocols (like RealAudio), and increased latency for ICMP and
 other network protocols. This is most evident when the upstream link is
 saturated (since downstream data is queued at the ISP's end and we can't do
 as much about that). The queued traffic is processed such that lower volume
 traffic protocols (like ssh) often get drowned out so to speak, by the higher
 volume, bulk traffic (like http or ftp), as there isn't any special
 prioritizing in default usage. 
 
</para>

<para>
 And if the upstream queuing, or other factors, causes enough of a delay, it
 can even decrease downstream bandwidth utilization by slowing the
 ACKnowledgements (which are heading upstream), that are required to keep a
 download moving at optimal rates. So it is possible that an upload can hurt
 a simultaneous download.

</para>

<!-- 
<para> 
 Another effect can occur on asymmetric networks, like some ADSL offerings
 where the downstream has significantly greater bandwidth than the upstream.
 While both the up and down channels can be used at the same time, the
 saturation of both can adversely effect the downstream performance under
 some conditions. TCP necessitates a certain amount of back and forth
 communication. So that during a download, for instance, there is always a 
 small percentage of upstream bandwidth being utilized by the downstream
 traffic. The greater the downstream bandwidth being utilized, the more
 upstream bandwidth is required to maintain the two-way TCP
 <quote>conversation</quote>. It can happen that the combined upstream
 pressures from both an upload, and a simultaneous download, degrades
 performance and results in a reduction of available downstream bandwidth.
 This is caused by the ACKnowledgements for the downstream traffic (which are
 headed upstream), getting delayed or possibly even lost, on route for a
 variety of reasons. The sender will only send as fast as we can tell it to.
 If our communications to the sender are impeded, then so is our speed coming
 back from the sender. This effect can be more pronounced on highly asymmetric
 connections.
</para>
-->

<para>
 Such effects can be largely mitigated with Linux's built-in traffic 
 shaping abilities. The user space tool for manipulating the kernel's
 advanced traffic routing features is <application>iproute</application>,
 sometimes packaged as <application>iproute2</application>. This includes various
 tools that can classify and prioritize traffic with a considerable degree of
 flexibility. It also requires various kernel config options to be turned on.
 And is also fairly close to Black Magic ;-) The definitive document on this
 is the Advanced Routing and Traffic Control HOWTO (<ulink
 url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO.html">http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO.html</ulink>).

<title>Dropped PPP Connections</title>
<para>
 PPPoE and PPPoA both rely on the venerable PPP protocol. This 
 protocol incorporates the Link Control Protocol (LCP), which is used to
 maintain the viability of the connection. Each end can send LCP echoes to other
 end, and if there is no response in the alloted time frame, the session is
 presumed dead, and is torn down. Again, either end can initiate this process.
 The client should then negotiate a new connection. But, this normally means a
 new IP address is assigned along with the new session. 

</para>

<para>
 Perhaps this is undesirable? While you certainly can't control what happens on
 the remote end in this regard, you can adjust PPP's very flexible way of
 dealing with LCP echoes on your end, to increase the number of echoes, extend
 the interval and timeout period on your end. This might help prolong the life
 of an unstable connection in situations with marginal line conditions, or a
 buggy peer on the other end. Read your client's documentation. YMMV.

</para>

<para>
 Some providers may deliberately enforce some time limit. There is not much 
 you can do about this.

</para>

<para>
 Also, frequently dropped connections are often an indication of a line 
 problem of some kind. This is something the telco should investigate.

<Title>Sync Problems</Title>

<Para>
 Read this section if you have had a working connection, but now have lost
 sync, are intermittently losing sync, your sync rate has dropped
 significantly, or are getting a <Quote>sync/no surf</Quote> condition.
 (Better quality modems will have a way to report sync rate, usually via
 telnet or a web browser interface. See the owner's manual.) 
</Para>

<Para>
 A loss of sync indicates a problem with the DSLAM, your line (inside or
 outside) or your modem. DSLAMs typically have <Quote>shelves</Quote> with
 <Quote>cards</Quote>. Alcatel DSLAM cards, just for instance, have a capacity
 of four connections each. If the card goes bad, at most four customers are
 effected. The point being that sync loss outages can be very isolated. Unlike
 network outages that tend to effect large numbers of users. Sync outages are
 a telco problem, not an ISP problem. If your service agreement is with the
 ISP, you will need to contact them, who will in turn contact the telco.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Degraded sync rates, and disruption of the DSL signal, can cause various
 problems. Obviously, you will never get your maximum throughput under these
 conditions. But, the symptoms are not always obvious as to whether the
 problem is on your end or the provider's. 
 
</Para> 
 
<Para> 
 For instance, a poor inside wire connection may result in retransmissions of
 packets that have been dropped. This can really reduce throughput and slow a
 connection down. It is tempting to think of packet loss as a traditional
 networking problem, but with DSL it is possible to be the result of a bad
 line, impaired signal, or even the modem itself.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Some things to try:
 
 <ItemizedList>

 <ListItem> 
  <Para>
   Power cycle the modem. Turn off the power button/switch, and physically
   unplug the cable to the wall jack for 30 seconds or so. Turn back on, and
   re-attach to the wall jack. This will force a resync. Unfortunately, the only
   way to power down a PCI modem, is to reboot. This may fix a 
   <Quote>sync/no surf</Quote> condition that is caused by the modem, and
   maybe other conditions too. 
   
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 
 

  <ListItem> 
   <Para>
  
   See the <Link LinkEnd="nosync">above section</Link> on moving the modem
   lock, stock and barrel to the NID and thus bypassing all inside wiring.
   If the situation is improved there, then the problem is inside somewhere. If
   not, it is a telco problem.
 
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 


 <ListItem> 
  <Para>
   RFI Bear-hunt: The DSL signal is fragile. There are a number of
   things that can degrade it.  RFI, or Radio Frequency Interference,
   from sources in and around the home/office is one common source of
   reduced signal strength, intermittent sync loss, low
   sync rates and high line error rates that can cause retransmissions and 
   slow things down. DSL frequencies just happen to be in a range that is 
   susceptible to many potential RFI sources. Our test tool here is simply a
   portable AM radio. Tune it to any channel where you can get clear reception
   -- it makes no difference where. The AM radio will pick up RFI that is in
   the same frequency range as the DSL signal. It will sound like
   <Quote>frying bacon</Quote> type static. Put it against your computer's
   power supply. You should hear some static. Move it away and the static
   should fade pretty quickly. This will give you an idea of what RFI sounds
   like. A decent quality power supply should produce only weak RFI --
   probably not enough to cause a problem. Use the radio like a Geiger counter
   and move it around your modem and DSL line. If you hear static, follow it
   to the source. Things to be suspicious of: power supplies, transformers,
   ballasts, electric motors, dimmer switches, high intensity lighting. Moving
   the modem, or rerouting cables is sometimes enough. Keeping the line
   between the modem and the wall jack as short as possible is a good idea
   too.
 
   </Para>
  </ListItem>

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    Chronic sync problems are often due to a line problem somewhere.
    Sometimes it is something as simple as a bad splice or corroded jack, and
    easily remedied if it can be found. Most such conditions can be isolated
    by a good telco tech. Check with your provider, and politely harass them
    if you have to. If you get the run-around, ask to go over their heads.
   
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If you are near the distance limits of DSL, and having off and on sync
    problems, try the <Quote>Homerun</Quote> installation. See <Link
    LinkEnd="homerun">above</Link>. This can be effective in improving
    marginal signal/sync conditions.
   
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
     If using a surge protector, try it without the surge protector. Some may
     interfere with the DSL signal.
  
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

 </ItemizedList>
</Para>

<Para>
 Another possibility is a nearby AM radio station, or bandit ham radio
 operator that are disrupting the DSL signal since they operate in a similar 
 frequency range. These may only cause problems at certain times of day, like
 when the station boosts its signal at night. A good telco DSL tech may be
 able to help minimize the impact of this. YMMV.

<Title>Network and Throughput Problems</Title>

<Para>
 Read this section if your connection is up, but are having throughput
 problems. In other words, your speed isn't what it should be based on your
 bit rate plan, and your distance from the CO. <Quote>Network</Quote> here is
 the WAN -- the ISP's gateway and local subnet/backbone, etc. Remember that a
 marginal line can cause a reduced sync rate, and this will impact throughput.
 See <Link LinkEnd="synctr">above</Link>.

</Para>

<Para>
 The two factors we will be looking for are <Quote>latency</Quote> and
 <Quote>packet loss</Quote>. Both are pretty easy to track down with the
 standard networking tools <Command>ping</Command> and
 <Command>traceroute</Command>. If either of these occur in our path, they
 will impact performance. Latency means <Quote>responsiveness</Quote> or
 <Quote>lag time</Quote>. Actually what we are interested in is abnormally
 high latency, since there is always some latency. Packet loss is when a
 packet of data gets dropped somewhere along the way. TCP/IP will know
 it's been <Quote>lost</Quote>, and there will be a retransmission of the lost
 data. Enough of this can really slow things down. Ideally packet loss should
 be 0%. 

</Para>

<Para>
 What we really need to be concerned about is that part of the WAN
 route that we routinely traverse. If you do a traceroute to several different
 sites, you will probably see that the first few <Quote>hops</Quote> tend to
 be the same. These are your ISP's local backbone, and your ISP's upstream
 provider's gateway. Any problem with any of this, and it will effect
 everywhere you go and everything you do. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 We can start looking for packet loss and latency by pinging two or three
 different sites, hopefully in at least a couple of different directions. We
 will be looking for packet loss and/or unusually high latency.

 High packet loss at 35%, and some really slow roundtrip times in there as
 well. A little digging on this showed that it was a backbone router 13 hops 
 into the traceroute that was the problem. While making this site really slow
 from here, it would only effect those routes that happen to hit that same
 router. Now what would really hurt us is if something similar happens with a
 router that we tend to go through consistently. Like our gateway, or maybe
 the second hop router too. Find these with <Command>traceroute</Command>, by

 It's a little tempting on this last real-life example to think this gateway
 router is acting up. But, as it turned out, this was the result of a problem
 in the DSLAM/ATM segment of the telco's network. So any first hop problem
 with packet loss or high latency, may actually be the result of something
 occurring before the first hop. We just don't have the tools to isolate
 where it is starting well enough. Packet loss can be a telco problem, just as
 much as an ISP/NSP problem. Or conceivably, even a modem problem. In which 
 case try resetting the modem by power cycling <emphasis>and</emphasis> by 
 unplugging/replugging the DSL cable (from the wall jack).

</Para>

<Para>
 It is also quite possible for the modem itself to cause packet loss. The fix
 here is to power cycle the modem, and resync by unplugging the DSL connection
 for 30 seconds or so. In fact, any part of the connection can be a source of 
 packet loss -- modem, DSLAM, ATM network, etc.

<Title>Measuring Throughput</Title>

<Para>
 One of the first things most of us do is check our speeds to make sure we
 aren't getting short changed, and that our system is up to snuff. Doing this
 accurately is easier said than done however. First, remember you are losing
 10-20% right off the top due to networking protocol overhead. Just how much
 is <Quote>lost</Quote> here depends on your provider's network architecture,
 where and how you are measuring this and other considerations. Most of us may
 wind up being closer to 20% than 10%.
 
</Para>

<Para> 
 Then, any time you hit the Internet, there is some slight degradation of
 performance with each hop you take. Now this may not amount to much, as long
 as you are not taking too many hops and all the components -- your system,
 your ISP's network, your ISP's upstream provider, and the destination itself
 -- are all working like well oiled machines. But there's the rub -- how do
 you really know with so many variables in the mix? One flaky interface, on
 one router, on one hop along the path, may cause misleading results.

</Para>

<Para>
 Your absolute max speed is going to be at your point of connection to your
 ISP -- the ISP's gateway. It can only go downhill from there, not up! So the
 ideal test is as close to home as possible. This eliminates as many unknown
 variables as possible. If your ISP has a local ftp server, this is an
 excellent place to run your own tests. (Run a traceroute though just to see
 how local it really is.) 
</Para> 
 
<Para> 
 If your ISP does not have this, look for an ftp site that is close -- the
 fewer the hops, the better. And look for one that isn't too busy, or you will
 get misleading results. Find a large file -- like 10 Megs -- and time the
 download. Try this over several days, and at different times of day. The
 server, and the backbone, are going to be busier at certain times of day,
 which can skew results and you want to eliminate these variables as much as
 possible. Your provider cannot compensate for heavy backbone traffic,
 backbone bottlenecks, slow or busy servers, etc. 

</Para>

<Para>
 There are many test sites scattered around the web. Some are better than
 others, but take these with a grain of salt. There are just too many
 variables for these tests to reliably give you an accurate snapshot of your
 connection and throughput. They may give you a general picture of whether you
 are in the ballpark of where you think you should be or not. One good speed
 test is <Ulink

 Another test is <Ulink

 Now keeping in mind that we are limited by the ~10-20% networking overhead rule,

 about 11,000 Ft, which is close enough that I should be able to hit my real

 <Emphasis>Big Caution</Emphasis>: my ISP uses a caching proxy server for

 from the proxy -- NOT the test site. Just FYI. Another note: at the same time
 I tried another test site and was consistently getting 600-700 Kbps. So YMMV
 with these tests. (Usually I get the same on each, more or less.) Timing a

<Title>Appendix: DSL Overview</Title>


<Para>
 DSL is a telephone loop technology that uses existing copper phones lines, 
 and provides a dedicated, high speed Internet connection. One of the big
 advantages of some DSLs (notably ADSL), are that they can co-exist on the
 same line with a traditional voice service such as <Quote>POTS</Quote> (Plain
 Old Telephone Service), and even ISDN. This is accomplished by utilizing
 different frequency ranges above the voice range (voice is up to 4KHz).
 Essentially, this gives two lines in one: one for voice, and one for Internet
 connectivity. When all is working normally, there should be no interference
 between the two <Quote>lines</Quote>. This gives DSL a potentially broad
 consumer base, and helps minimize costs for service providers.

</Para>

<Para>
 DSL is positioned for the Home and Small Office (SOHO) market that is 
 looking for high speed Internet access at reasonable prices. Since it also
 typically provides dedicated, <Quote>always on</Quote> access, it can be used
 for interconnecting low to mid range bandwidth servers, and provides a great
 access solution for small LANs. It is also great for those Linux power users
 that just want a fat pipe  :-).

</Para>

<Para>
 Phone companies, and other independent telecommunications providers (CLECs),
 are now deploying DSL to stay ahead of the Cable
 companies -- the main consumer and SOHO competition for DSL providers. This
 mad rush to get <Quote>a piece of the pie</Quote>, is bringing much
 competition (a good thing!), much diversity, and some confusion, into the
 consumer market. The DSL provider (often, but not always, the phone company)
 will provide the DSL infrastructure. This would include your line, the DSLAM,
 and physical connection to the outside world. From there it is typically
 picked up by an ISP, who provides the traditional Internet services.
 
</Para>


<Para>
 Consumer DSL plans are typically <Quote>best effort</Quote> services. While
 boasting speeds approaching T1, and even surpassing that in some cases, it is
 not necessarily as reliable as T1 however. Business class DSL offers more
 reliability at a higher cost than consumer plans, and is a good compromise
 where both reliability and bandwidth are at a premium. All in all, the cost
 of DSL compared to traditional telco services, such as T1, is attractive and
 substantially more affordable for home and small business users.

</Para>
 
<Para>
 DSL providers often do not have service contracts for home users,
 while business class DSL services typically do include similar SLAs (Service
 Level Agreements) to that offered for a T1 line.

</Para>

<Para>
 The downside is that DSL is not available everywhere. Availability, and
 available bit rate (speed), are purely a function of where you live, where
 the telco has installed the prerequisite hardware, how far you are from the
 DSLAM/CO, and the quality of your phone line (loop). Not all loops are
 created equal, unfortunately. The primary limitation is distance.

<Para>
 <ItemizedList>

 <ListItem>
   <BridgeHead renderas=sect3>ADSL</BridgeHead>
 <Para>
   Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop currently supports downstream rates up
   to 8 Mbps, and upstream of 1024 Kbps, hence the <Quote>asymmetric</Quote>.
   ADSL is far and away the most widely deployed consumer DSL, and was
   specifically developed for the home and SOHO markets. The higher downstream
   rates lends itself to those not running serious servers -- at least
   anything more than a small, personal web site. ADSL is capable of sharing
   data with a POTS (or ISDN) voice line, so an additional line is not
   required. A big selling point. ADSL, like other DSLs, is limited by
   distance. 18,000 ft (5.5 km) is a typical cut-off point for telcos. ADSL
   does typically require either a splitter or filters to isolate the DSL
   signal from POTS. Sometimes referred to as <Quote>full rate</Quote> ADSL in
   order to differentiate it from G.Lite DSL. There are two line encodings for
   ADSL: DMT and CAP. DMT (a.k.a. Alcatel compatible) has won the standards
   battle and is now the standard and the most common. Also, note that modems
   must be compatible with the encoding. In other words, a CAP modem will not
   work with a DMT service, and vice versa. Also, ISDN requires
   <quote>modems</quote> (NTs), and related hardware such as filters, that are
   specific to that type of line since the signal on the line is very
   different for POTS and ISDN.
  
  </Para> 
 </ListItem>
 
 <ListItem>
   <BridgeHead renderas=sect3>G.Lite</BridgeHead>
  
  <Para> 
   G.Lite is sometimes referred to as <Quote>DSL Lite</Quote>,
   <Quote>Universal DSL</Quote> or <Quote>splitterless ADSL</Quote>, is a
   slower version of ADSL that requires no splitters <Emphasis>or</Emphasis>
   filters. G.lite uses a <Quote>fast retrain</Quote> technique to negate the
   various signal disturbances caused by normal POTS usage. Currently G.Lite
   supports speeds up to 1.5 Mbps/512 Kbps, and at one time was expected to
   become the dominant consumer DSL service. As of this writing, it is not
   nearly as wide spread as <Quote>full rate</Quote> ADSL however.

 <ListItem>
   <BridgeHead renderas=sect3>SDSL</BridgeHead>

  <Para> 
   Single-pair Digital Subscriber Loop, or also sometimes referred to
   as <Quote>Symmetric Digital Subscriber Loop</Quote> since it is indeed
   symmetric with a current maximum rate of 1.5 Mbps/1.5 Mbps. SDSL requires a
   dedicated line, and thus true SDSL is not as readily adaptable to the
   consumer market as ADSL. SDSL also uses a 2B1Q encoding (same as ISDN and
   some T1) which is considered more robust than the DMT or CAP encoding of
   ADSL. True SDSL is generally considered more of a server quality DSL, and
   is typically marketed as a business class service. It is worth noting that
   some providers may be promoting a <Quote>SDSL</Quote> service that is
   really ADSL pinched so that upstream/downstream are the same. Or vice
   versa, SDSL with asymmetrically allocated bandwidth. Wasn't all this
   confusing enough already?

 <ListItem>
   <BridgeHead renderas=sect3>IDSL</BridgeHead>

  <Para>
   ISDN Digital Subscriber Loop, 144 Kbps/144 Kbps is really a new and
   improved ISDN from Lucent Technologies and uses the same 2B1Q line encoding
   as ISDN, SDSL and others. IDSL does require a dedicated line however. The
   benefits are that it is an <Quote>always on</Quote> technology, like other
   DSLs, and provides an additional 16 Kbps over traditional ISDN. It is being
   marketed by some DSL providers as a low end bit rate option, where line
   quality is not sufficient for higher speeds such as that of ADSL.
   Ironically, IDSL is generally priced significantly higher than ADSL.

 <ListItem>
   <BridgeHead renderas=sect3>RADSL</BridgeHead>

  <Para>
   Rate Adaptive Digital Subscriber Loop was developed by Westell and has a
   potential of 2.2 Mbps downstream and 1.0 Mbps upstream. What makes RADSL
   more flexible is that the sync rate can be dynamically adjusted up or down
   as line conditions change. This makes it more of a viable alternative where
   line conditions are marginal due to distance or other factors. In many
   respects, RADSL is an enhanced ADSL to meet a more diverse set of line
   conditions. Like ADSL, RADSL can piggyback on the POTS line. RADSL does not 
   require any splitters or filters.

   High bit-rate DSL was one of earliest versions of DSL. HDSL

<Title>The DSLAM</Title>

<Para>
 This technology is made possible by the placement of DSLAMs, or Digital
 Subscriber Loop Access Multiplexers, from such suppliers as <Ulink

 in the telco's Central Office, or sometimes a suitable remote location.
 DSLAMs come in various shapes and sizes, and are the one, single complex and
 costly component of a DSL connection. When a qualified phone line is
 connected to a modem at the user's end of the loop, a high speed digital
 connection is established, typically over ATM, or sometimes frame relay. The
 DSLAM splits the signal back into separate voice and data channels. The voice
 channel stays within the telco network, whereas the data is picked up by an
 ISP (typically).

<Title>Sync</Title>
 
<Para> 
 A good, working connection to the DSLAM is referred to as
 <Quote>syncing</Quote>. This is typically indicated by LEDs on the modem.
 Without sync, nothing happens. The modem will establish a sync rate which is
 often throttled by the provider at a predefined limit. This limit, or
 <Quote>cap</Quote>, is at the provider's discretion and is part of the
 service that is being provided. Your modem may well sync at a higher rate
 than the <Quote>cap</Quote>, but your speed will be limited to whatever
 <Quote>cap</Quote> the provider is enforcing. So while ADSL has an upward
 theoretical limit of 8 Mbps, you will not see that speed -- unless of course
 your provider is selling an 8 Mbps plan. Most plans are well below this.

</Para>

<Para>
 Below is the status information from a SpeedStream 5660 modem/router via the

</para>

<Para>
 First notice the <Quote>Current Attainable Rate</Quote> in the
 <Quote>ATU-C</Quote> column. This is the downstream sync rate negotiated by
 the modem and DSLAM, which is over 3.5 Mbps. The actual speed is limited,
 however, to 1.5 Mbps/384 Kbps from the first row <Quote>TX Rate</Quote>. This
 is the theoretical limit of this connection. This limit, or
 <Quote>cap</Quote>, can be enforced at the DSLAM, as is the case the here, or
 further upstream. Had the first row <Quote>TX Rate</Quote> been lower than
 the provider's imposed limit, then this would indicate some kind of problem
 with the connection, perhaps due to distance or some kind of line impairment. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 The attainable sync rate is the result of a number of factors, including wire
 distance to the DSLAM, quality of both inside and outside wiring, the loop
 wire gauge and various other factors within the loop.  Actual measurable,
 real world throughput, on the other hand, is first of all dependent on sync
 rate. Low sync rate means low throughput. In the above example, had the sync
 rate been lower, say 500 Kbps, then that would be the maximum for that
 connection, even though the customer is paying for a 1.5 Mbps service.
</Para> 
 
<Para> 
 Secondarily, throughput will depend also on the ISP's network, and then the
 ISP's upstream provider.  You will lose approximately 10-20% of potential
 throughput to networking overhead. In the above example where the connection
 is throttled at 1.5 Mbps, the actual, real-world maximum throughput would be
 somewhere around 1.2-1.3 Mbps when overhead is taken into account. Moreover,
 once you hit the Internet proper, all bets are off as there are any number of
 factors that may impact throughput. A overloaded or busy server is likely to
 be slow no matter how fast your DSL connection is.

<Title>DSL Modems</Title>

<Para>
 The <quote>modem</quote> is the last piece of the connection. The modem is
 connected directly to the DSLAM via the copper loop on the telco end, and
 plugs into a wall jack on your end. When all is well, the modem
 <Quote>syncs</Quote> with the DSLAM, and then makes an IP connection to the
 ISP, and off we go!

</Para>

<Para>
 For Linux users, <Emphasis>the modem is a very important
 consideration</Emphasis>! There are many modems supplied by ISPs that are not
 Linux compatible. Your best bet is an external, ethernet interfaced modem (or
 modem/router combo) that connects via a standard ethernet NIC, since many
 other modem options (PCI, USB, onboard) will not work due to a lack of
 drivers at this time! All ethernet based modems will work fine. (See the
 <Link LinkEnd="modems">Modems Section</Link> for an up-to-date list of
 compatible modems.) ISDN users will need a modem (NT) designed specifically
 for DSL over ISDN.
 
</Para>

<Para> 
 With ethernet modems, the only potential compatibility issue is the Network
 Card (NIC). (And really any compatible ethernet NIC should do just fine --
 100 Mbps is not even necessary.) You are probably better off anyway, since PCI and
 USB modems can be more problem prone. If your chosen provider does not
 offer a compatible modem as an option, then you either need to look
 elsewhere, or you will have to buy one outright from a third party.

</Para>

<Para>
 As always, there are exceptions. <Ulink URL="http://www.xpeed.com">Xpeed</Ulink> 
 now has drivers for two PCI modems included with the kernel drivers (as of
 2.2.18, not in 2.4 yet though AFAIK). These are the first open source Linux DSL modem
 drivers, and is welcomed news. <Ulink
 URL="http://www.alcateldsl.com">Alcatel's</Ulink> ADSL SpeedTouch USB modem
 now has Linux drivers.  And more recently, the Eci Hi Focus ADSL USB Modem 
 has drivers (and some related chipsets are supported as well, see 
 <ulink url="http://eciadsl.sourceforge.net/">http://eciadsl.sourceforge.net/</ulink>).
 IteX PCI ADSL modems, based on the Apollo chipset, have Linux drivers.
 (Modems using this chipset are sold under a number of various brand names.)
 Diamond also makes [made?] an internal PCI modem which has binary-only
 drivers, but it is not in widespread use, and seems to be discontinued at
 this point. It is also possible to make a direct ATM connection using a modem
 plus an ATM network card, though this delivery system is not used in the U.S.
 as far as I know, and should not be considered as a viable option. This would
 also require a 2.4 kernel.

</Para>

<Para>
 The most common type of modem in use today is actually a combination
 <Quote>bridge</Quote> and modem device. The bridge is a simple device,
 typically with little configuration.  Network traffic passes blindly across
 the ATM to ethernet bridge in either direction. Your point of exposure is the
 interface (typically a NIC) that is connected to the modem/bridge.  
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Some ISPs are also offering <Quote>routers</Quote>. These are basically
 combination modem/routers that can handle NAT, and may have other feature
 enhancements such as port forwarding, a built in hub, etc. These are all
 external, so should work too. But probably not a big deal for Linux users,
 since Linux can do anything these do, and more. A locked down Linux box makes
 a most excellent firewall/gateway/proxy! 

</Para>

<Para>
 To confuse things even more, there are also all-in-one devices: combo
 bridge+router+modem, sometimes called <Quote>brouters</Quote>. In this case,
 the modem can be configured for either bridged or routed modes -- but it
 can't be both at the same time.

</Para>

<Para>
 All providers should make available a modem of some sort. Many ISPs will have
 more than one modem option. Some may give away the modem at no additional
 charge. Some may offer a free base model, and charge the difference for the
 better models with more features. Many of the modems that ISPs supply are not
 available through normal retail channels. Should you want to buy one
 yourself, this leaves used equipment outlets (e.g. ebay), or possibly buying
 a modem that your ISP may not support (i.e. a possibility of no tech support
 if you have a problem). 
</Para>

<Para>
 While some ISPs provide modems that are not readily available through normal
 retail channels, there are a number of manufacturers that are getting on the
 DSL modem bandwagon, and offering a good selection. Most have a
 number of enhancements. At this time Alcatel (now owned by Thomson), Intel,
 Zyxel, Cisco, 3Com, and Cayman have products available. Depending on model
 and feature set, prices range from a little over $100 US to $800 and up. Many
 of these handle their own authentication and encapsulation (DHCP, PPPoE,
 etc).
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Are some modems better than others? Short, easy answer: no. Modems are not
 much of a factor in speed in most cases. But some do have enhanced features,
 such as diagnostics or the combo modem/routers. Ethernet modems are
 generally considered the most reliable. Fewer IRQ hassles, no buggy drivers,
 etc. So the fact that Linux users are mostly relegated to ethernet modems is
 a blessing in disguise really. Are any of these better than others? Hard to
 say since most of this is so new there is not enough of a track record to
 compare brands and models with any degree of assurance. In other words, any
 old external, ethernet modem should do -- provided it matches your
 provider's DSL, and is configured for that service. Remember, there can be
 differences here.

</Para>

<Warning>
 <Para>
 Make sure any third party modem or router you may purchase is compatible with
 your DSL provider. There are two major line encodings for ADSL (CAP and DMT
 a.k.a. Alcatel compatible), and several options for IP encapsulation. And
 different DSLs (SDSL, IDSL, etc) will require their own modems too, as will
 ISDN lines. Your provider should have a list of compatible options. It may
 well have to be configured for your ISP's service too. Don't expect it to
 work right out of the box either (unless it does indeed come from your
 provider). Many are accessible via telnet, or a web browser, where the
 configuration options are available. See the owner's manual for this.

<Sect2 id="ispconn">
<Title>The ISP Connection</Title>

<Para>
 The modem connects to the DSLAM, and then the DSLAM is connected to the
 telco's ATM network (or frame relay), where it is picked up by the ISP. The
 ISP typically will take over at what we <Quote>see</Quote> as the first hop on a
 <Command>traceroute</Command>.  Everything up to that point is in the hands
 of the telco/DSL provider. The ISP will connect to the telco's ATM network 
 via a high-speed data connection, usually ATM over a DS3 (45 Mbps) or
 possibly an OC-3 (155 Mbps). The important thing here is that an ISP must
 <Quote>subscribe</Quote> with your telco to provide this connection. The ISP
 will provide traditional ISP type services: email, DNS, news, etc. It is
 really a two step connection -- DSL from one provider, Internet from a second
 -- even though these may be combined into one billing. 

</Para>

<Para>
 The Baby Bells (RBOCs) in the U.S. all own ISPs. These, of course, are
 connected to their DSLAMs, and are providing Internet services via the
 telco's ISP subsidiary.  Many independent ISPs are availing
 themselves of the ILEC's DSL services, and in essence
 <Quote>reselling</Quote> the DSL services of the ILEC. While the underlying
 infrastructure is the same in this case, having more than one ISP working out
 of a CO may mean a better selection of features and prices for the consumer. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 CLECs (independent telcos) are now installing their own DSLAMs in many U.S.
 markets. This makes them a direct competitor to the ILEC. In this scenario,
 there would be two (or more) DSL providers in the same CO, each with their
 own DSLAM(s), and each competing against each other. This complicates the ISP
 situation even further, as each DSL provider will be <Quote>partnered</Quote>
 with one or more ISPs. If you are lucky here, you will have many choices of
 plans and pricing structures. 
</Para>

<Para>
 At this time, there is a shake out going on in the U.S. market. The
 independents are all struggling to match the deep pockets of the regional
 phone companies. The independents that have survived are now focusing more 
 on small business and higher-end consumer customers. This means, it will 
 cost more, but you should also expect to get more. Especially, in the 
 quality department.
</Para>

<Para>
 Typically, your service agreement is with the ISP, and not the DSL
 provider.  This makes the actual DSL provider a <Quote>behind the
 scenes</Quote> player.  This may vary, and in some cases, you may wind up
 with a separate service agreement for both the DSL provider and the ISP.

<Sect2>
<Title>Availability</Title>

<Para>
 Who can get DSL? The first requirement is that a telco has installed the
 necessary hardware somewhere on their end. Typically this is in the CO. You
 have no choice on which CO is yours -- it is wherever your loop terminates.
 If your CO has a DSLAM, and the necessary other components, then DSL may be
 available to you. This is often known as <Quote>pre-qualifying</Quote>, and
 is Step One in getting service. 
</Para>

<Para>
 More and more <Quote>remote terminals (aka DSLAMs)</Quote> are being
 deployed. This is certainly good news for those that are a long way from 
 the CO. CO distance is not the limiting factor it once was.

<Sect3>
<Title>Ordering</Title>

<Para>
 Before ordering service, check to see what providers there are in your area.
 Look for options on both the telco/DSL side and the ISP side. You may have
 several options, including the large phone companies, as well as smaller,
 local ISPs. Once an order is placed, you must wait for the qualification
 process before a provider will agree to provide service. 

</Para>

</Sect3>

<!--  ~  End Section  ~  -->



<!--   ~~~~~       New Section      ~~~~~     -->

<Sect3 id="qualify">
<Title>Qualifying</Title>

<Para>
 Once local availability is established, the next step is
 <Quote>qualifying</Quote> your loop. The provider will run various tests to
 make sure that your loop can handle the DSL signal. This is to determine how
 suitable your line is for DSL, and maybe what level of service will be
 available to you. You probably will have to order service just to find out
 this much. It can be a fairly involved process, with a variety of different
 tests being run. There are a number of things that may
 <Quote>disqualify</Quote> a line. The most common limitation is distance. 

</Para>

<Para> 
 All DSLs have distance limitations. ADSL is limited
 to a loop length of roughly 18,000 ft (5.5 km), but the actual cut off point
 will vary from provider to provider. The further away you are, the weaker the
 signal, and the potential for poor connections is greater. With ADSL, if you
 are within approximately 12,000 ft (3.7 km), you should be able to get at
 least 1.5 Mbps -- all other things being equal. IDSL has even greater reach,
 mainly because the maximum speed for IDSL is considerably lower at 144
 Kbps/144 Kbps.

</Para>

<Para>
 Still even if you're close enough, there are a number of potential
 impediments that may disqualify a line. Two such common impediments
 are load coils and bridge taps. These are aspects of the old telco
 infrastructure that once were deemed beneficial, but now are getting
 in the way of the newer, digital technologies.  <comment>This next
 sentence could stand rephrasing. HB - ??? sounds good to me?</comment>
 Whether you hit a snag like this or not, is pretty much hit or miss.  Fiber
 anywhere in the loop is also a disqualifier. The provider may take steps to
 <Quote>clean</Quote> the line. Just how far they are willing to go will vary
 from provider to provider, and this will likely add additional time to the
 installation process.

</Para>

<Para>
 Once the line is <Quote>qualified</Quote>, the next step is deciding on which
 plan is suitable for your situation.  The provider may have differing plans
 available depending on how strong a signal they think your line can handle.
 If you are marginal, you will not be qualified for the higher speed plans.
 And if price is a factor, having a tiered pricing structure is good also
 since the lower end plans are obviously less expensive. How this is
 structured also varies wildly from provider to provider. Since, DSL is a new
 service, and providers are trying to find the right price/feature
 combinations that will attract the most users and thus gain a competitive
 edge.

 and a near infinite number of other possibilities. The cost of different
 plans generally goes up with their speed.
</Para>

<Para>
 Should you be disqualified, and have other options, get a second opinion.
 Calculating the effective loop length is by no means an exact science. There
 is plenty of room for errors. Also, some providers may go to greater lengths
 to <Quote>clean</Quote> the loop than others. And, if you have more than one
 phone line, and are disqualified, then try the other line. Just because they
 both terminate at your location, does not necessarily mean they are the same
 length! The telco network is full of surprises.

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. Does DSL work with Linux?
  </Para>

  <Para>
   DSL is a technology, or more correctly, a group of related technologies.
   This is akin to asking if Linux works with telephones. The technology
   itself does not care. So, the short answer is <Quote>Yes, of
   course!</Quote>. The long answer is that if there are any impediments, they
   are being imposed by the provider. There are things they may do, that can
   make getting Linux up and running, more of a challenge than it needs to be.
   Not having a compatible modem option available is one common gotcha. Also,
   if the telco or ISP is doing the installation, they may require a Windows
   or Mac system to be available. This saves them the costs of training their
   techs on various alternative OSes. Buyer beware!

  </Para>
   
  <Para>
   Basically all DSL does, is facilitate a high speed Internet connection. At
   some point, it is all TCP/IP, and Linux, of course, handles TCP/IP quite
   well.

  </Para>
   
 </ListItem> 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   Q. Where can I find drivers for my PCI (or USB) modem?
  </Para>

   <Para>
    With a few exceptions, you probably can't, because they are just not
    available. Your best bet is an external, ethernet interfaced modem for all
    intents and purposes. If your provider does not offer one, you will have
    to find another provider, or buy your own modem outright. Just make sure
    it is compatible with your provider's flavor of DSL.
   </Para>

   <Para>
    The are exceptions to every rule. See the <Link LinkEnd="modems">Modems
    Section</Link> for a list of compatible modems as of this writing.
 
   </Para>
   
   <Para>
    If an incompatible modem puts you in a bind, hopefully you will take the
    time to politely harass the manufacturer  ;-).
    
   </Para>

   <Para>
    This situation is changing for the better. <Ulink

     Q. How fast or good of a network card do I need?
   </Para>
  
    <Para>
     Any card that is compatible with Linux should work fine. Remember even
     low-end cards are 10 Mbps, and no consumer class DSL is near that at this
     time. I would suggest a reasonably good quality card, just to help
     eliminate the possibility of errors and premature failure.

    Q. How can I find out when DSL will be available in my area?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   Just where and when DSL gets deployed is totally in the hands of
   your friendly local telco. They obviously can't do everyone at
   once, so they probably are selecting areas based on competitive
   factors. Getting a straight answer from a telco on this question
   can also be a challenge.  Probably so as not to tip their hand to
   competitors. Unfortunately, it is a question only they can answer.

  <Para>
   Move? Seriously, there isn't much you can do. If there are other providers, 
   get another opinion. You never know. Determining the loop length is an
   inexact science, and there is room for errors. Many use databases for
   this, and these databases routinely have some inaccuracies. Some providers
   too, may be more aggressive in taking steps to help you out and clean up
   the line. Also, some providers offer low-end speed services that have
   greater reach. Maybe this will become available in your area. Or, the telco
   may install, at some point, remote devices for customers who are now too
   far away.

  <Para>
    Not necessarily. This distance limitation is not where the CO is, but 
    where the DSLAM is. These are often installed in CO's, but more and more 
    are being installed in remote locations in order to expand the reach 
    of DSL service.

    Q. What are the speed tweaks for Linux?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   This may not be necessary. Linux is pre-tweaked for the most part,
   unlike some versions of Windows that really need some registry hacks to get
   optimum performance. If you have a high latency connection, you may 
   benefit from increasing the TCP Receive Window. See the <Link
   LinkEnd="tuning">Tuning</Link> section.

   Now if you are convinced you are not getting the performance you should
   based on your distance and line conditions, then there might be a problem

    Q. My service is limited to 640K (for example). Can I get better speed by
    getting a faster modem? Any way around this?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   No, and no. The modem has little bearing on how fast your connection is for
   all intents and purposes. The provider has a mechanism in place for
   limiting your speed somewhere in the pipe before you hit the Internet.
   There is no way to defeat this.

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. Can I download and upload at the same time? Is one effected by the
    other?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
    The upstream and downstream channels use separate frequency ranges within 
    the DSL signal, so simultaneous upload/download is not a problem and 
    available bandwidth is not normally impacted.
  </Para>

  <Para>
    Where there may be somewhat of an adverse impact, is with asymmetric DSLs
    like ADSL, <Emphasis>and</Emphasis> both the upstream and downstream are
    simultaneously saturated. This is a TCP 'feature' and not DSL related
    though. This can adversely effect the faster stream (i.e. the downstream).
    How much of an impact depends on a slew of factors and is beyond the scope
    of this document, but is more pronounced with higher ratios of downstream
    to upstream (e.g. 640/90). See the <link linkend="bottlenecks">Tuning</link>

   Q. I am paying for 768 Kbps service, and the best I ever get is 640 Kbps or

  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   You will lose 10-20% of the rated capacity due to the overhead inherent 
   in the various protocols utilized. Most of us will probably fall closer to
   20%. This is just a fact of life for everybody. Just how much is lost here
   depends on various factors. You seem to be close to your maximum when this
   is taken into consideration. Also, if you read the fine print, many ISPs
   are advertising speeds <Quote>up to</Quote> such and such. Check your
   service agreement and see if there are any guarantees. If there are, they
   may be well below the advertised maximum speed, and may be based on sync
   rate instead of actual throughput. Though this may vary from provider to
   provider as well. 
   
  </Para>

  <Para>
   Also, be careful how you test this. Some of the so-called test sites can be
   pretty unreliable. There can be many factors between you and that site that
   can impact your throughput and skew results -- not the least of which is
   how many people might be trying that same test at the same time. The best 
   test is via FTP download from a known good, close, not too busy site.

   Q. Can DSL work with ISDN, and how is this different? 
  </para>
  <para>
   Yes, there have been DSL capable modems and service providers for some
   time. In fact, this is common in parts of Europe. So this is not an issue.
  </para>
  <para>
   What makes ISDN different is the underlying signal on the line is
   fundamentally different than a POTS line. This means that any physical
   layer hardware has to be compatible with ISDN (and conversely it is
   incompatible with POTS lines). So this means the NT (modem), filters, etc,
   all have to be designed for ISDN. Other than these low level issues, the
   other aspects of DSL implementation are the same (e.g. network protocols).

  <Para>
    Q. Why does PPPoX have such a bad rap?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
    The occasional disconnects is one of the biggest gripes. PPP seems to be 
    sensitive to any interruptions in the connection. Generally a disconnect
    means a new IP. And there are those that say PPP, by its very nature, was
    never meant to be an <Quote>always on</Quote> protocol. PPP is a session
    management protocol at heart, that requires a user to initiate a
    connection and authenticate him or herself. PPPoE/A are not yet
    particularly mature protocols either. They do not have much of a history
    or track record. Some would say the telcos and hardware manufacturers have
    rushed this out the door. PPPoE also requires an additional layer of
    software just to maintain the connection. This is one more layer of code
    and one more potential point of failure. Also, more system overhead is
    utilized to manage the connection.
    
   </Para>

   <para>
    The impact of the disconnect problem can potentially be eased by adjusting 
    the PPP LCP-echo settings to extend the period before the local end of 
    the connection decides to terminate the session. Each end of the
    connection uses LCP echoes to make sure the other end is still 
    <quote>there</quote>. Nothing much can be done if the remote end decides
    to tear down a session (other than to do what you can to make sure you are
    responding to it's LCP echoes).

   </para>

 </ListItem>

 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. Why PPPoX? This seems like a bad idea!
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   PPP gives several advantages to the provider: they can use their existing
   infrastructure and hardware that they now use for their (larger) dialup
   customer base. It is easier to control user authentication and potential
   abuse situations, and easier to manage their network and related issues. In
   fact, it most boils down to its just easier for them. Easier, means saves
   man hours, and therefore saves costs (at least from their perspective).
  
  </Para>

   It is not a conspiracy to conserve IP addresses, or thwart heavy users. IP
   address costs are insignificant in the overall scheme of things.

   support</Quote>. They are just saying that they will not give you tech
   support when and if you have problems. This does not mean you cannot use
   Linux on their network. Just that you may have to fend for yourself when
   and if a problem does arise. Anything that is forbidden will be in their
   Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), or Terms of Service (TOS) agreement.
   
  </Para>

  <Para>
   I have heard stories where a new tech or installer has misinterpreted their

    Q. My fax software does not work with my DSL modem. Why is that?
  
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
    Faxes are normally transmitted over typical analog phone lines by dialing 
    the fax machine on the other end. Analog modems can handle this, but

  <Para>
    Q. What does <Quote>FastPath</Quote> mean? Is it better? Faster? What is
    interleaving? How can I get better ping times?

  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   Interleaving is a feature of DMT line encoding. Essentially it is a form 
   of error correction that is configurable at the DSLAM. The side effects are
   a slower connection, especially higher latency. With FastPath (or sometimes 
   called non-interleaved) DMT, gateway pings can be in the 10-25 ms range. With 
   interleaving, this is more likely to be in the 40-75 ms range depending on 
   the degree of interleaving that has been enabled.
   
  </Para>

  <Para>
   On the positive side, a marginal line is more stable and less prone to
   errors with interleaving. Many telcos have interleaving on by default since
   increased stability would seem to be a good thing. But this is only
   beneficial for marginal lines, and everyone else is paying a latency tax
   for this. Some telcos may be amenable to turning this feature on/off. YMMV.

    Q. How fast and powerful of a computer do I need for DSL? My ISP says I
    need at least a Pentium 200. Why?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
    At the most basic level, a 386 will work fine. In most situations, you are
    connected to what is essentially an ethernet based network. So
    theoretically anything that can handle a very slow ethernet connection
    would work. No comment on how well Netscape will run on a 386 though ;-)
    But as far as just managing a raw connection, a 386 is indeed workable.
    What else you can do with it, is another matter.
    
  </Para>

  <Para>
    Where this gets a little more complicated is the modem, and the client
    that the ISP may require. Any PCI or USB modem is going to require
    drivers, which means more CPU and system resources. Also, PPPoE does even
    more processing, so again the potential CPU load is increased. Windows
    tends to be not so efficient with all this going on, hence the requirement
    for mid range Pentiums by some ISPs.
    
  </Para>

  <Para>
   With Linux it will depend on what you are going to do. A low end Pentium
   should be fine for most uses. A 386/486 should do nicely for just a
   firewall/gateway box in most situations. Just remember if you are running
   PPPoE, you may take a performance hit on low end hardware.

    Q. I just got my DSL installed, and my speed sucks, and/or my connection

  </Para>

    Not enough information to say, really. There are many, many things that
    can cause a poor connection. The list is too long to mention them all.
    
  </Para>
   
  <Para>
    One of DSL's weaknesses is that the signal can be fairly fragile. Many
    things can degrade the signal, making for poor connections, and thus
    speed. This can be caused by poor or substandard inside wiring, a wiring
    problem outside (like bad splice), RFI from any number of sources, AM
    radio signal interference from a nearby station, bridge taps on your
    line, excessive distance from the DSLAM and so on. Not to mention possible
    hardware problems with your modem, NIC, or the telco's DSLAM, etc. Not
    always easy to sort out.
 
  </Para>

  <Para>
   Your provider should be able to assist you. First, make sure the problem
   isn't with your setup as they likely won't help solve a Linux problem. Then
   be persistent, and don't hesitate to go over someone's head if the help is
   not forthcoming. Most problems are solvable. The trick is isolating it. A
   good telco tech, trained for DSL, can find all kinds of obscure wiring
   problems.

    Q. Now that I have a dedicated line, do I really need an ISP?

  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   Yes, and no. Linux has everything needed to run a small ISP. But even
   though the <quote>line</quote> is a dedicated connection, it is only
   dedicated to the telco end-point equipment. You still need someone to sell
   you bandwidth, and gateway access to the Internet. So, traditional ISPs
   still have their role. You might see if there is a local provider of some
   kind that will just sell you the bandwidth without all the frills (e.g.
   email and news). But this probably will not save any costs.
  </Para>
  
  <para>
   It is also technically possible to connect two DSL modems via 
   a <quote>dry</quote> copper line. In some areas, a dry line (with 
   no dial tone), is fairly inexpensive (but in others areas it's not).
   And then you need someone on the other end who is willing to provide 
   the bandwidth and whatever services may be needed. Not all DSL modems
   support this (some common SDSL modems apparently do). This is also going to
   require dealing with the local phone company for something that is not a
   consumer type service (read: might be a real PITA). There is also a 
   significant start up investment, that may not come with any telco 
   guarantees for the intended use.

   Technically speaking, you can. Some DSL modems (at least the Alcatel

   Q: Why does DSL have all these bit rates (384/1.5/7.1M/20M/etc) options?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   The basic problem is the 100 year old design of the copper loop. It works
   great for analog phone, but it presents a real challenge for higher 
   performance signals like DSL. Remember that the distance of a loop is
   inversely proportional to the data rate that it can carry. Rate adaptive
   technologies are great for making a digital signal work in many situations,
   but it can't provide a consistent bandwidth for all applications,
   especially for very long (over ~15,000 ft) loops. The different bandwidths
   that you see advertised reflect various marketing battles of vendors
   equipment, and the telco struggle to finalize on a standard set of data
   rates. The bottom line is for the telco to be able to reach as broad a
   customer base as possible.

  <Para>
   Q: What are all these loop impairments (bridge taps, load coils, DLCs) that
   could disqualify my line from DSL? (thanks to Bruce Ediger) 
  </Para>

  <Para>
   Load coils: in-line inductances that improve voice-frequency transmission
   characteristics of a telephone circuit.  Essentially, a "load" steals energy
   from high frequencies and gives it to lower frequencies.  Typically only used
   in very long (&gt; 9,000 ft) phone lines.
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   By "bridges" I assume you mean "bridged taps".  In older neighborhoods, the
   phone wiring will have been used by more than one customer.  Perhaps these
   customers lived at different (though near-by) addresses.  The unconnected
   "spur" of wiring is a "bridged tab" on the currently connected circuit.
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   DLCs, Digital Loop Carriers: there's a bunch of systems for carrying more
   than one voice transmission on a single pair of wires.  You can shift the
   frequencies up or down, or you can digitize the voice transmissions and
   divide the telephone circuit by time or code or something.  The more
   general term is "pair gain".
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   These things cause different problems for high-frequency communications.
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   Load coils will completely mess up things by filtering high frequencies and
   passing low frequencies.  They probably also change the "delay envelope",
   allowing some frequencies to arrive before others.  One byte's tones will
   interfere with the next byte's.
  </Para>

  <Para>
   Bridged taps act as shunt capacitances if they're long in relation to the
   signals wavelength, and they'll actually act as band pass filters if they're
   about 1/4 wavelength of the signal.  That is, they'll pass particular
   frequencies freely.  Particular tones of a DMT modem might get shunted back,
   rather than passed along to the receiving modem, reducing bandwidth for that
   telephone line.
  </Para>
 
  <Para>
   Pair gain, digital or analog, limit the bandwidth available to one
   transmission in order to multiplex several on one wire.  High and low tones
   of a DMT transmission get filtered out by the apparatus.

    Q. Can I run a web server with my DSL connection?
  
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   Sure. You are connected to a TCP/IP network, so theoretically you can run 
   any service that the protocols allow -- mail, ftp, ssh, irc, etc. Where
   there may be problems, is with the ISP's TOS (Terms of Service). Some ISPs
   are pretty open on this, while others forbid any type of server, and may
   even block certain ports. You should research this, or ask the ISP before
   making any plans. ISPs that are selling a consumer service are not
   going to allow any high volume servers -- just personal, or low traffic
   services at best. If this does not fit the bill, then you can check with 
   any local Business class DSL providers. This will cost more, but the 
   Terms of Service, and guarantees, are generally much more suited to 
   higher bandwidth usages.

    Interleaving is a tunable aspect of DMT/ADSL line encoding. It essential 
    controls the 'interleaving' of bits in the transmission, and is used

<Sect3 id="cable">
<Title>Cable Modem vs DSL</Title>

<Para>
 The Telcos see DSL as a competitor to the Cable Company's Cable
 Modem, and as such, are providing competitive pricing and configuration
 offerings. Although Cable Modems are advertised as having 10-30Mbps potential 
 bandwidth, they use a shared transmission medium with many other users on the
 same line, and therefore performance may vary, sometimes greatly, with the amount
 of traffic, time of day, and number of other users on the same node. But YMMV.

</Para>

<Para>
 It is often heard that DSL has an advantage in that it is a private pipe to
 the Internet, with dedicated bandwidth. This is mostly a myth. You do have a
 private pipe to the DSLAM, but at that point, you enter the telco's ATM (or
 frame relay) network, and start sharing bandwidth. You are at the mercy of
 how well your DSL provider and ISP manage their networks. The consensus seems
 to be that DSL providers and ISPs are mostly doing a better job of managing
 bandwidth than the Cable companies. It is easier for them to add and adjust
 bandwidth as needed to meet demand. You are less likely to have speed
 fluctuations due to other users being on line at the same time. But, again,
 this gets down to how well the specific network and bandwidth are managed.

</Para>


<Para>
 DSL probably has a small security advantage too. With most Cable modem
 networks, it is like being on a big LAN. You are sharing your connection (and
 bandwidth) right at the point of connection. But if you are not doing
 something to filter incoming connections already, you are asking for trouble
 either way. And, the cable companies are addressing this now, with more 
 secure approaches. This should not now be a major deciding factor.
</Para>

<Para>
 There also seems to be a better chance of having ISP alternatives with DSL
 than Cable. At least, in the U.S. this is true. Choice is a good thing, and
 so is competition. It seems most Cable outfits give you just one choice for
 an ISP. If you don't like it, you are out of luck. The number of options with
 DSL probably varies greatly by geographic areas. Populous areas, like
 Northeast U.S., seem to have many options. 
</Para>

<Para>
 So which is better? The differences aren't as much with the technology, as they
 are with the implementations. If you look around, you can find plenty of
 horror stories on either. And plenty of happy customers too. The way
 to know what may be the best for you, is to do comparative shopping based on
 experiences of other users in your area. Don't base your choice on one
 person's opinion. This is statistically invalid. Likewise, don't base your
 choice on someone's opinion who has had a particular service for only a short
 time. Again, statistically not worth much. Get as many opinions from those
 that are using the <Emphasis>exact same services</Emphasis> that you are
 looking at.

<Title>Fiber in the Loop (IFITL or FTTC, and FTTH)</Title>

<Para>
 In some areas, newer neighborhoods are being built with fiber optic cable
 instead of the traditional telco copper lines. While the fiber is a definite
 problem for DSL services, it has it's own potential advantages. Existing
 fiber is potentially capable of 100 Mbps, and it looks like this could easily
 go up soon. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 So while telco fiber customers are being shut out of the DSL market 
 (since DSL is a copper only technology), they may have much to look forward
 to. Technologies are under development, and in some cases just now being
 deployed, to take advantage of fiber telco phone loops. Known as
 <Quote>FTTC</Quote> (Fiber To The Curb), or <Quote>IFITL</Quote> (Integrated
 Fiber In The Loop), this technology is another high speed service that telcos
 can offer. The speeds are sufficient for VoD (Video on Demand) and VoDSL
 (Voice over DSL), and other high bandwidth services. One nice advantage here
 is, that since there is no DSL signal on the wire, the only required CPE is a
 network card. In other words, no modem -- just connect a NIC to the wall jack
 and off you go! This will also allow the telco to provide other digital
 services such digital TV. 

</Para>

<Para>
 FTTC is Fiber To The Curb. The last leg into the house is still copper. FTTH 
 (Fiber To The Home), on the other hand, is an all fiber loop with even higher
 potential.

<Title>Wireless</Title>

<Para>
 There is a lot of buzz about wireless technologies these days. Wireless would
 certainly seem to have a place in the broadband market, especially for areas
 that don't have ready access to cable or telco networks. There are still
 some inherent problems with the current state of this technology that may prevent
 it from becoming a major player in the near term however. Weather can still
 impact the wireless signal -- heavy cloud cover or rain for instance. Also,
 there is some pretty hefty latency if the uplink is via satellite. Surely
 these drawbacks will improve over time. But how soon?

<Title id="linrouter">Setting up Linux as a Router</Title>


<Para>
 Depending on your local setup, you should consider some other issues.  These
 include a firewall setup, and any associated configurations.  For my setup,
 shown in Figure 5 below, I use an old i486 machine configured as a
 firewall/router between the DSL connection and the rest of my home network.
 I use private IP addresses on my private LAN subnet, and have configured my
 router to provide IP Masquerading and Firewalling between the LAN and
 WAN connections.

 HOWTO</Ulink> for more information.  For 2.4 kernels see the <Ulink
 URL="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO.html"
>Linux 2.4 Advanced Routing HOWTO</Ulink>. My experience is that Linux is more
 flexible and provides superior routing/firewalling performance. It is
 much less expensive than a commercial router -- if you find an old 486 machine
 that you may be using as a doorstop somewhere. There any number of 
 brands of <quote>DSL/Cable</quote> routers on the market as well. These 
 might be the way to go for pure ease of use, but lack the sophistication 
 of what Linux can do.

<Para>
 What I did is setup a Linux router (Redhat Linux 5.0  on a i486) with two
 ethernet interfaces. One interface routes to the ISP subnet/gateway (eth0 in
 above example), and the other interface (eth1 above) goes to a hub (or switch)
 and then connects the LAN with private network addresses (e.g. 192.168.1.x).
 Using the private network addresses behind your router/firewall allows some
 additional security because it is not directly addressable from outside. You
 have to explicitly masquerade your private addresses in order to connect to
 the Internet from the LAN. The LAN hosts will access the Internet via the
 second NIC (eth1) in the Linux router. Just set their gateway to the IP
 address of the second NIC, and assign them addresses on the same network.

Chris's SGML: <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

<para>
 The Alcatel SpeedTouch USB modem is one of a very few non-ethernet modems with 
 Linux drivers. This modem is quite popular in Europe (Alcatel's home turf),
 and is widely used elsewhere as well. Hats off to Alcatel!

</para>

<para>
 For this to work, you will essentially need three things: the Alcatel modem 
 firmware and management utility (supplied directly by Alcatel in 
 closed source, binary form), a properly configured kernel and PPP daemon,
 and the Linux modem driver and related configuration. The modem driver itself
 is open source. There are currently two distinct, unrelated drivers available.

</para>

<para>
 When drivers were first released, the installation process required a fair
 amount of patching and rebuilding to make things work. Since then, things
 have progressed, and it can now be done without any patching (see below). 
 How well all the pieces go together may depend on how old your Linux
 installation is, the kernel and PPP versions, and possibly what patches your
 vendor may have applied to their own packages. Recent Linux releases
 <emphasis>probably</emphasis> have most, if not all, of this already done,
 and hence you may not need to do any patching. I believe this is true of
 recent SuSE, Mandrake, and Debian (and probably others as well). You still
 need the Alcatel binary firmware, and a driver for the modem (if
 your distro does not include this). I would suggest checking your distro's
 web site, and search their archives for documents relating to this modem, and
 go from there as a first step. YMMV.

</para>

<para>
 One obvious requirement is a kernel with USB support. USB and ATM support are
 better in recent kernels, and I would suggest if not using a very current
 Linux distribution, then at least get a recent kernel. And a quick note 
 on kernels and patching: if using the kernel source supplied with a Linux 
 distribution, it is most likely very heavily patched already. Applying
 patches to these can be hit or miss. 
</para>

<para>
 As always with Linux, there is more than one way to skin a cat. This is 
 true of this modem and is resulting in some confusion since there
 are various documents circulating on this modem with various approaches
 taken. Some are more current than others too. Keep this in mind if you run
 into conflicting recommendations. Again, your distribution is probably the
 best source of documents.
</para>

<para>
 There are two separate driver projects for this modem. The installation 
 and configuration are completely different, as is the code base. Both are
 open source and GPL. One is a kernel module solution, originally developed by
 Alcatel, and now maintained by Johan Verrept. His HOWTO is located at <ulink
 url="http://linux-usb.sourceforge.net/SpeedTouch/howto.html">http://linux-usb.sourceforge.net/SpeedTouch/howto.html</ulink>.
 I think most would agree that the installation of this driver is the more
 complex of the two, and more than likely will require some patching (unless
 your distro has already done this). But, it may have some slight performance
 benefits since it runs mostly in kernel space.

 There is also the
 Alcatel-Speedtouch-USB-mini-HOWTO from Chris Jones, <Ulink
 URL="http://www.linuxdude.co.uk/docs/Alcatel-Speedtouch-USB-mini-HOWTO/">http://www.linuxdude.co.uk/docs/Alcatel-Speedtouch-USB-mini-HOWTO/</Ulink>.

 This driver can potentially support both PPPoE and PPPoA connections. 

</para>

<para>
 The other driver is by Benoit Papillault and friends. This one has a less
 complicated installation, and can be done with <emphasis>no
 patching</emphasis>. All the important parts here are done in user space. For
 inexperienced users, or just plain ease of use, this may well be the most painless
 way to go. The home page is <ulink
 url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/speedtouch">http://sourceforge.net/projects/speedtouch</ulink>
 and related docs are <ulink
 url="http://speedtouch.sourceforge.net/docs.php">http://speedtouch.sourceforge.net/docs.php</ulink>.
 This driver can also work with 2.2 kernels (2.2.17 or later). PPPoE is not
 an option with this driver at this time. This driver also does not use 
 the management utility that is part of the Alcatel supplied binary package. 
 It extracts the modem firmware, and then does its own
 <quote>management</quote>, so less dependent on proprietary code. Mandrake is
 reportedly including an RPM of this driver now.

</para>

<para>
 Since this modem potentially supports both PPPoE and PPPoATM connections,
 which one is better? Which ever is supported by your ISP, and then 
 which ever works best for you! If your ISP supports both (some do and 
 some don't), you might try each approach and make your own decision. 
 There is no absolute right or wrong on such things. There are just too 
 many variables. Theoretically at least, PPPoA should utilize a little 
 less overhead and system resources.

</para>

<para>
 There are other USB modems on the market that use an Alcatel chipset, 
 such as the Efficient Networks 4060. Do not expect either of these drivers to
 work with other modems. They won't. You should get a compatible ethernet 
 modem in such situations. There are other USB modems with Linux drivers also.
