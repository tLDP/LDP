     Some of us running Linux (like me) are looking for the
     best parts of Linux.  Among them is the ability to re-use old
     systems (like 486 CPUs) as a client (with the Win32 client; like
     Hummingbird's Exceed) to run Linux from any PC.  It is somehow
     very surprising that there aren't many documents on the internet
     which guide you step by step on how to set this up.  Essentially, by
     using XDMCP, you can create a cheap solution of a client and
     server environment.

     I have tested the setup running an X Server that listens to an
     XDMCP session on Red Hat 6.0, 6.2 and Red Hat 7.0.  I have not
     had a chance to test it on any other Linux flavors.  If you have
     successfully setup one other than Red Hat platform, please share
     it with us.  My server hardware is an IBM PC clone running an
     Intel Pentium II 400 Mhz with 128 MB memory and 30 MB ATA-66
     Hard Drive.  I use a 3COM 10/100 Fast Ethernet (3C509B) NIC.
     I setup the X Server to accept 6 session clients.

   <title>Steps to Complete the Procedure</title>

     <para>
     These are steps I used to setup the Server for accepting XDMCP requests: 

     <orderedlist>

      <listitem>
       <para>
         Modify <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d/xfs</filename> and make the 
         following changes. Change all (this is where the Font Server port):
       </para>
         <screen>daemon xfs -droppriv -daemon -port -1</screen>
       <para>
         to:
       </para>
         <screen>daemon xfs -droppriv -daemon -port 7100</screen>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
         In <filename>/etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess</filename>, change
         (this allow all hosts to connect):
       </para>
         <screen>#*    # any host can get a login window</screen>
       <para>
         to:
       </para>
         <screen>*     # any host can get a login window</screen>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
       Edit <filename>/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf</filename>.
       This activates XDMCP, causing it to listen to the request.
       Change this:
       </para>
         <screen>
         [xdmcp]
         Enable=0</screen>

	 Before changing this line, you can use the
	 <command>telinit</command> command to test prior to
	 modifying the line.  Use either <command>telinit 3</command>
	 to set to level 3, or <command>telinit 5</command> to set to

   <title>Testing</title>

     <para>
     To test if your XDMCP X Server is now ready to accept
     connections, do these steps.  I find it easier using the X
     Server and another machine to test:

     <orderedlist>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        (Though you don't need to; it doesn't hurt...)  Reboot the machine (I am
         assuming you are running level 5).
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
	Make sure the Graphical login page comes up.  Make sure the
	display resolution and mouse work. Log in from the console to
	see if the local access is OK.  If OK, do not log off.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
	Setup Hummingbird Exceed to either query this machine (using
	the IP address or fully qualified DNS name) and try to
	connect to the X server.  You should see the X Session come
	up and the login screen appear.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        If possible, test the maximum number of allowed login sessions.
        This will ensure access is open to only this number.
       </para>
      </listitem>

     </orderedlist>

     </para>
   </sect2>

 <sect1 id="ts">
  <title>Troubleshooting</title>

  <para>
  <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
       If X cannot come up and is broken:
       </para>
       <para>
       If X is broken and the connection fails, 
       most of the time it has this error messages:
       </para>
       <screen>
       _ FontTransSocketUNIXConnect: Can't connect: errno = 111
       failed to set dafault font path 'unix:-1'
       Fatal server error:
       could not open default font 'fixed'</screen>
       <para>
       This is likely due to xfs not finding the correct port for
       the Font Server.  To resolve this, check steps 1 and
       7 above.  Make sure all the ports are pointing to (port)
       7100 and make sure you have the following fonts installed (if
       not re-install the XFree86 font packages):
       </para>
       <screen>
         FontPath  "/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/"
         FontPath  "/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"
         FontPath  "/usr/lib/X11/fonts/CID"
         FontPath  "/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo"
         FontPath  "/usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi"</screen>
       <para>
       Use the command <command>startx</command> (on local) to restart 
       the X server (or use <command>telinit 5</command>).
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
       If Exceed has no respond: 
       </para>
       <para>
       In this case, most likely your xdm (or gdm, depending upon which
       is used in <filename>/etc/inittab</filename>) is not starting
       correctly.  Issue the command: 
       <command>ps -ef | grep gdm</command> (or
       <command>ps -ef | grep xdm</command> if xdm is used).
       </para>
       <para>
       If the process is not running, check step 8 on the setup above (make sure 
       there are no typo's and that the correct path is given). Restart 
       X using the command <command>telinit 5</command>.

 <sect1 id="gdm">
  <title>XDMCP and GDM (Gnome Display Manager)</title>

  <para>
     The following is taken from the
     <ulink url="http://www.oswg.org/oswg-nightly/oswg/en_US.ISO_8859-1/articles/gdm-reference/gdm-reference/index.html">
     Gnome Display Manager Reference Manual</ulink>:
  </para>

      <para>
        GDM also supports the X Display Manager Protocol (XDMCP) for
        managing remote displays.
      </para>

      <para>
        GDM listens to UDP port 177 and will repond to QUERY and
        BROADCAST_QUERY requests by sending a WILLING packet to the
        originator.
      </para>

      <para>
        GDM can also be configured to honor INDIRECT queries and
        present a host chooser to the remote display. GDM will
        remember the user's choice and forward subsequent requests to
        the chosen manager.
      </para>

      <para>
        GDM only supports the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 authentication
        system.  Little is gained from the other schemes, and no
        effort has been made to implement them so far.
      </para>
      <para>
        Since it is fairly easy to do denial of service attacks on the
        XDMCP service, GDM incorporates a few features to guard
        against attacks. Please read the XDMCP reference section below
        for more information.
      </para>

      <para>
        Even though GDM tries to outsmart potential attackers, it is
        still adviced that you block UDP port 177 on your firewall
        unless you really need it. GDM guards against DoS attacks, but
        the X protocol is still inherently insecure and should only be
        used in controlled environments.
      </para>

      <para>
        Even though your display is protected by cookies the XEvents
        and thus the keystrokes typed when entering passwords will
        still go over the wire in clear text. It is trivial to capture
        these. You should also be aware that cookies, if placed on an
        NFS mounted directory, are prone to eavesdropping too.
