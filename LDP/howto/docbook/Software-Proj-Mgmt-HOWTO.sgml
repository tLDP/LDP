   <para>
    This HOWTO is designed for people with experience in programming
    and some skills in managing a software project but who are new to
    the world of free software. This document is meant to act as a
    guide to the non-technical aspects of free software project
    management and was written to be a crash course in the people
    skills that aren't taught to commercial coders but that can make
    or break a free software project.

 <sect1 id="intro">
  <title>Introduction</title>
  
  <indexterm>
   <primary>fswd!introduction</primary>
  </indexterm>
  
  <para>
   Skimming through freshmeat.net provides mountains of reasons for this
   HOWTO's existence--the Internet is littered with excellently
   written and useful programs that have faded away into the universe
   of free software forgottenness. This dismal scene made me ask
   myself, "Why?"
  </para>

  <para>
   This HOWTO tries to do a lot of things (probably too many), but it
   can't answer that question and won't attempt it. What this HOWTO
   will attempt to do is give your Free Software project a fighting
   chance--an edge. If you write a piece of crap that no one is
   interested in, you can read this HOWTO until you can recite it in
   your sleep and your project will probably fail. Then again, you can
   write a beautiful, relevant piece of software and follow every
   instruction in this HOWTO and your software may still not make
   it. Sometimes life is like that. However, I'll go out a limb and
   say that if you write a great, relevant pieces of software and
   ignore the advise in this HOWTO, you'll probably fail <emphasis>
   more often</emphasis>.
  </para>

  <para>
   A lot of the information in this HOWTO is best called common
   sense. Of course, as any debate on interfaces will prove, what is
   common sense to some programmers proves totally unintuitive to
   others. After explaining bits and pieces of this HOWTO to Free
   Software developers on several occasions, I realized that writing
   this HOWTO might provide a useful resource and a forum for
   programmers to share ideas about what has and has not worked for
   them.
  </para>

  <para>
   As anyone involved in any of what seems like an unending parade of
   ridiculous intellectual property clashes will attest to, a little
   bit of legalese proves important.

   <para>
    In this version I have the pleasure of acknowledging:
   </para>

   <para>Fellow Debian developer Martin Michlmayr and Vivek
   Venugopalan who sent me information and links to extremely
   interesting articles. I've added both to the bibliography and I've
   added information from each into the HOWTO. Thanks to Andrew Shugg
   who pointed out several errors in the document. Also, a big thanks
   to Sung Wook Her (AKA RedBaron) who is doing the first translation
   of the HOWTO into Korean. I've been happy to see that people have
   enjoyed and benefited from the HOWTO so far.</para>

   <para>
    Older thanks that I don't want to take out yet include: Josh
    Crawford, Andy King, and Jaime Davila who all read through this in
    entirety and gave me feedback that has helped me make changes and
    improvements to this document. I can't thank you guys enough for
    your help. An extra <quote>Thank You</quote> goes to Andy King who
    who read through this several times and submitted patches to make
    life easier for me.
   </para>

   <para>
    Karl Fogel, the author of <citetitle>Open Source Development with
    CVS</citetitle> published by the Coriolis Open Press. Large parts
    of his book are available <ulink
    url="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com">on the web</ulink>. 225 pages of
    the book are available under the GPL and constitute the best
    tutorial on CVS I've ever seen. The rest of the book covers,
    <quote>the challenges and philosophical issues inherent in running
    an Open Source project using CVS.</quote> The book does a good job
    of covering some of the subjects brought up in this HOWTO and much
    more. <ulink url="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com">The book's
    website</ulink> has information on ordering the book and provides
    several translations of the chapters on CVS. If you are seriously
    interested in running a Free Software project, you want this
    book. I tried to mention Fogel in sections of this HOWTO where I
    knew I was borrowing directly from his ideas. If I missed any, I'm
    sorry. I'll try and have those fixed in future versions.
   </para>

   </para>

   <para>
    Also providing support material, and inspiration for this HOWTO is
    Eric S. Raymond for his prolific, consistent, and carefully
    crafted arguments and Lawrence Lessig for reminding me of the
    importance of Free Software. Additionally, I want to thank every
    user and developer involved with the <ulink
    url="http://www.debian.org">Debian Project</ulink>. The project
    has provided me with a home, a place to practice free software
    advocacy, a place to make a difference, a place to learn from
    those who have been involved with the movement much longer than I,
    and proof of a free software project that definitely, definitely
    works.
   </para>

   <para>
    Above all, I want to thank <emphasis>Richard Stallman</emphasis>
    for his work at the Free Software Foundation and for never giving
    up. Stallman provides and articulates the philosophical basis that
    attracts me to free software and that drives me toward writing a
    document to make sure it succeeds. RMS can always be emailed at

    Feedback is always and most certainly welcome for this
    document. Without your submissions and input, this document
    wouldn't exist. Do you feel that something is missing? Don't
    hesitate to contact me to have me write a chapter, section, or
    subsection or to write one yourself. I want this document to be a
    product of the Free Software development process that it heralds
    and I believe that its ultimate success will be rooted in its
    ability to do this. Please send your additions, comments, and

   <title>Translations</title>

   <para>
    I know that not everyone speaks English. Translations are nice and
    I'd love for this HOWTO to gain the kind of international reach
    afforded by translated versions.
   </para>

   <para>
    I've been contacted by a reader who promises a translation into
    Korean. However, this HOWTO is still young and other than the
    promise of Korean, English is all that is currently available. If
    you would like to help with or do a translation, you will gain my
    utmost respect and admiration and you'll get to be part of a cool
    process. If you are at all interested, please don't hesitate to

 <sect1 id="starting">
  <title>Starting a Project</title>

   <indexterm>
    <primary>fswd!starting</primary>
   </indexterm>
  <para>
   With very little argument, the beginning is the most difficult
   period in a project's life to do successful free software project
   management. Laying a firm foundation will determine whether your
   project flourishes or withers away and dies. It is also the subject
   that is of most immediate interest to anyone reading this document
   as a tutorial.
  </para>

  <para>
   Starting a project involves a dilemma that you as a developer must
   try and deal with: no potential user for your program is interested
   in a program that doesn't work, while the development process that
   you want to employ holds involvement of users as imperative.
  </para>

  <para>
   It is in these dangerous initial moments that anyone working to
   start a free software project must try and strike a balance along
   these lines. One of the most important ways that someone trying to
   start a project can work toward this balance is by establishing a
   solid framework for the development process through some of the
   suggestions mentioned in this section.
  </para>


<!-- Section2: chooseproject-->

  <sect2 id="chooseproject">
   <title>Choosing a Project</title>

   <para>
    If you are reading this document, there's a good chance you
    already have an idea for a project in mind. Chances are also
    pretty good that it fills a perceived gap by doing something that
    no other free software project does or by doing something in a way
    that is unique enough to necessitate a brand new piece of
    software.
   </para>

   <sect3 id=identifyidea>
    <title>Identify and articulate your idea</title>
    <para>
     Eric S. Raymond writes about how free software projects start in
     his essay, <ulink
     url="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/"><quote>The
     Cathedral and the Bazaar,</quote></ulink> which comes as required
     reading for any free software developer. It is available online .
    </para>

    <para>
     In <quote>The Cathedral and the Bazaar,</quote> Raymond tells us
     that: <quote>every good work of software starts by scratching
     a developers itch.</quote> Raymond's now widely accepted
     hypothesis is that new free software programs are written, first
     and foremost, to solve a specific problem facing the developer.
    </para>

    <para>
     If you have an idea for a program in mind, chances are good that
     it targets a specific problem or <quote>itch</quote> you want to
     see scratched. <emphasis>This idea is the project.</emphasis>
     Articulate it clearly. Write it out. Describe the problem you
     will attack in detail. The success of your project in tackling a
     particular problem will be tied to your ability to identify that
     problem clearly early on. Find out exactly what it is that you
     want your project to do.
    </para>

    <para>
     Monty Manley articulates the importance of this initial step in
     an essay, <quote><ulink
     url="http://news.linuxprogramming.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2000-10-31-001-05-CD">Managing
     Projects the Open Source Way.</ulink></quote> As the next section
     will show, there is <emphasis>a lot</emphasis> of work that needs
     to be done before software is even ready to be coded. Manley
     says, <quote>Beginning an OSS project properly means that a
     developer must, first and foremost, avoid writing code too
     soon!</quote>
    </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3 id=evalulateidea>
    <title>Evaluate your idea</title>

    <para>
     In evaluating your idea, you need to first ask yourself a few
     questions.  This should happen before you move any further
     through this HOWTO. Ask yourself: <emphasis>Is the free software
     development model really the right one for your
     project?</emphasis>
    </para>

    <para>
     Obviously, since the program scratches your itch, you are
     definitely interested in seeing it implemented in code. But,
     because one hacker coding in solitude fails to qualify as a free
     software development effort, you need to ask yourself a second
     question: <emphasis>Is anybody else interested?</emphasis>
    </para>

    <para>
     Sometimes the answer is a simple <quote>no.</quote> If you want
     to write a set of scripts to sort <emphasis>your</emphasis>
     <acronym>MP3</acronym> collection on <emphasis>your</emphasis>
     machine, <emphasis>maybe</emphasis> the free software development
     model is not the best one to choose. However, if you want to
     write a set of scripts to sort <emphasis>anyone's</emphasis>
     <acronym>MP3</acronym>s, a free software project might fill a
     useful gap.
    </para>

    <para>
     Luckily, the Internet is a place so big and so diverse that,
     chances are, there is someone, somewhere, who shares your
     interests and who feels the same <quote>itch.</quote> It is the
     fact that there are so many people with so many similar needs and
     desires that introduces the third major question: <emphasis>Has
     somebody already had your idea or a reasonably similar
     one?</emphasis>
    </para>

     <sect4 id=evalwhere>
      <title>Finding Similar Projects</title>

     <para>
      There are places you can go on the web to try and answer the
      question above. If you have experience with the free software
      community, you are probably already familiar with many of these
      sites. All of the resources listed below offer searching of
      their databases:

    </sect4>

    <sect4 id=evalhow>
     <title>Deciding to Proceed</title>
     <para>
      Once you have successfully charted the terrain and have an idea
      about what kinds of similar free software projects exist, every
      developer needs to decide whether to proceed with their own
      project. It is rare that a new project seeks to accomplish a
      goal that is not at all similar or related to the goal of
      another project. Anyone starting a new project needs to ask
      themselves: <quote>Will the new project be duplicating work done
      by another project? Will the new project be competing for
      developers with an existing project? Can the goals of the new
      project be accomplished by adding functionality to an existing
      project?</quote>
     </para>

     <para>
      If the answer to any of these questions is <quote>yes,</quote>
      try to contact the developer of the existing project(s) in
      question and see if he or she might be willing to collaborate
      with you.
     </para>

     <para>
      For many developers this may be the single most difficult aspect
      of free software project management, but it is an essential one. It is
      easy to become fired up by an idea and get caught up in the
      momentum and excitement of a new project. It is often extremely
      difficult to do, but it is important that any free software
      developer remembers that the best interests of the free software
      community and the quickest way to accomplish your own project's
      goals and the goals of similar projects can often be
      accomplished by <emphasis>not</emphasis> starting a new
      development effort.
     </para>

    </sect4>

<!-- Section2: naming-->

  <sect2 id="naming">
   <title>Naming your project</title>

   <para>
    While there are plenty of projects that fail with descriptive
    names and plenty that succeed without them, I think naming your
    project is worth giving a bit of thought. Leslie Orchard tackles
    this issue in an <ulink
    url="http://www.advogato.org/article/67.html">Advogato
    article</ulink>. His article is short and definitely worth looking
    over quickly.
   </para>

   <para>
    The synopsis is that Orchard recommends you pick a name where,
    after hearing the name, many users or developers will both:
   </para>

   <para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>Know what the project does.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>Remember it tomorrow.</para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </para>

   <para>
    Humorously, Orchard's project, <quote>Iajitsu,</quote> does
    neither. It is probably unrelated that development has effectively
    frozen since the article was written.
   </para>

   <para>
    He makes a good point though. There are companies whose only job
    is to make names for pieces of software. They make
    <emphasis>ridiculous</emphasis> amount of money doing it and are
    supposedly worth it. While you probably can't afford a company like
    this, you can afford to learn from their existence and think a
    little bit about the name you are giving your project because it
    <emphasis>does</emphasis> matter.
   </para>

   <para>
    If there is a name you really want but it doesn't fit Orchard's
    criteria, you can still go ahead. I thought <quote>gnubile</quote>
    was one of the best I'd heard for a free software project ever and
    I still talk about it long after I've stopped using the
    program. However, if you can be flexible on the subject, listen to
    Orchard's advice. It might help you.
   </para>
  </sect2>

<!-- Section2: licensing-->

  <sect2 id="licensing">
   <title>Licensing your Software</title>
   
   <para>
    On one (somewhat simplistic) level, the difference between a piece
    of free software and a piece of propriety software is the
    license. A license helps you as the developer by protecting your
    legal rights to have your software distributed under your terms
    and helps demonstrate to those who wish to help you or your
    project that they are encouraged to join.
   </para>
   
   <sect3 id="chooselicense">
    <title>Choosing a license</title>

    <para>
     Any discussion of licenses is also sure to generate at least a
     small flame war as there are strong feelings that some free
     software licenses are better than others. This discussion also
     brings up the question of <quote>Open Source Software</quote> and
     the debate over the terms <quote>Open Source Software</quote> and
     <quote>Free Software</quote>. However, because I've written the
     Free Software Project Management HOWTO and not the Open Source
     Software Project Management HOWTO, my own allegiances in this
     argument are in the open.

    <para>
     In attempting to reach a middle ground through diplomacy without
     sacrificing my own philosophy, I will recommend picking any
     license that conforms to the <ulink
     url="http://www.debian.org/social_contract">Debian Free Software
     Guidelines</ulink>. Originally compiled by the Debian project
     under Bruce Perens, the <acronym>DFSG</acronym> forms the first
     version of the <ulink
     url="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition_plain.html">Open
     Source Definition.</ulink> Examples of free licenses given by the
     <acronym>DFSG</acronym> are the <acronym>GPL</acronym>, the
     <acronym>BSD</acronym>, and the Artistic License. As ESR mentions
     in his HOWTO<xref linkend="esrhowto">, don't write your own
     license if at all possible. The three licenses I mention all have
     long interpretive traditions. They are also definitely free
     software (and can therefore be distributed as part of Debian and
     in other places that permit the transfer of free software).
    </para>

    <para>
     Conforming to the definition of free software offered by Richard
     Stallman in <ulink
     url="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"><quote>The Free
     Software Definition</quote></ulink>, any of these licenses will
     uphold, <quote>users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study,
     change and improve the software.</quote> There are plenty of
     other licenses that also conform to the <acronym>DFSG</acronym>
     but sticking with a more well-known license will offer the
     advantage of immediate recognition and understanding.  Many
     people write three or four sentences in a COPYING file and assume
     that they have written a free software license--as my long
     experience with the debian-legal mailing professes, this is very
     often not the case.
    </para>

    <para>
     In attempting a more in-depth analysis, I agree with Karl Fogel's
     description of licenses as falling into two groups: those that
     are the <acronym>GPL</acronym> and those that are not the
     <acronym>GPL</acronym>.
    </para>

    <para>
     Personally, I license all my software under the
     <acronym>GPL</acronym>. Created and protected by the Free
     Software Foundation and the GNU Project, the
     <acronym>GPL</acronym> is the license for the Linux kernel,
     GNOME, Emacs, and the vast majority of GNU/Linux software. It's
     the obvious choice but I also believe it is a good one. Any BSD
     fanatic will urge you to remember that there is a viral aspect to
     the <acronym>GPL</acronym> that prevents the mixture of
     <acronym>GPL</acronym>'ed code with non-<acronym>GPL</acronym>'ed
     code. To many people (myself included), this is a benefit, but to
     some, it is a major drawback.
    </para>

    <para>
     Many people write three or four sentences in a COPYING file and
     assume that they have written a free software license--as my long
     experience with the debian-legal mailing professes, this is very

     your software, and it may make things very difficult for people
     that want to use your software but who pay a lot of attention to
     the subtle legal points of licenses. If you are passionate about

   <title>Choosing a Method of Version Numbering</title>

   <para>
    <emphasis>The most important thing about a system of version
    numbering is that there is one.</emphasis> It may seem pedantic to
    emphasize this point but you'd be surprised at the number of
    scripts and small programs that pop up without any version number
    at all.
   </para>

   <para>
    <emphasis>The second most important thing about a system of
    numbering is that the numbers always go up.</emphasis> Automatic
    version tracking systems and people's sense of order in the
    universe will fall apart if version numbers don't rise. It doesn't
    <emphasis>really</emphasis> matter if 2.1 is a big jump and
    2.0.005 is a small jump but it does matter that 2.1 is more recent
    than 2.0.005.
   </para>

   <para>
    Follow these two simple rules and you will not go (too)
    wrong. Beyond this, the most common technique seems to be the
    <quote>major level,</quote> <quote>minor level,</quote>
    <quote>patch level</quote> version numbering scheme. Whether you
    are familiar with the name or not, you interact with it all the
    time. The first number is the major number and it signifies major
    changes or rewrites. The second number is the minor number and it
    represents added or tweaked functionality on top of a largely
    coherent structure. The third number is the patch number and it
    usually will only refer to releases fixing bugs.
   </para>

   <para>
    The widespread use of this scheme is why I know the nature and
    relative degree in the differences between a 2.4.12 release of the
    Linux kernel and a 2.4.11, 2.2.12, and 1.2.12 without knowing
    anything about any of the releases.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can bend or break these rules, and people do. But beware, if
    you choose to, someone will get annoyed, assume you don't know,
    and try and educate you, probably not nicely. I always follow this
    method and I implore you to do so as well.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    There are several version numbering systems that are well known,
    useful, and that might be worth looking into before you release
    your first version.
   </para>

   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>Linux kernel version numbering:</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>The Linux kernel uses a versioning system where any odd
      minor version number refers to an development or testing release
      and any even minor version number refers to a stable
      version. Think about it for a second. Under this system, 2.1 and
      2.3 kernels were and always will be development or testing
      kernels and 2.0, 2.2. and 2.4 kernels are all production code
      with a higher degree of stability and more testing.
     </para>

      <para>
       Whether you plan on having a split development model (as
       described in <xref linkend="branches">) or only one version
       released at a time, my experience with several free software
       projects and with the Debian project has taught me that use of
       Linux's version numbering system is worth taking into
       consideration. In Debian, <emphasis>all</emphasis> minor
       versions are stable distributions (2.0, 2.1, etc). However,
       many people assume that 2.1 is an unstable or development
       version and continue to use an older version until they get so
       frustrated with the lack of development progress that they
       complain and figure the system out. If you never release an odd
       minor version but only release even ones, nobody is hurt, and
       less people are confused. It's an idea worth taking into
       consideration.

      complex free software models available. The project's version
      numbering has reflected the unique situation in which it is
      developed.
      </para>

      <para>
       Mozilla's version numbering structure has historically been
       made up of milestones. From the beginning of the mozilla
       project, the goals of the project in the order and degree to
       which they were to be achieved were charted out on a series of
       <ulink url="http://www.mozilla.org/roadmap.html">road
       maps</ulink>. Major points and achievements along these
       road-maps were marked as milestones. Therefore, although
       Mozilla was built and distributed nightly as <quote>nightly
       builds,</quote> on a day when the goals of a milestone on the
       road-map had been reached, that particular build was marked as
       a <quote>milestone release.</quote>
      </para>

      <para>
       While I haven't seen this method employed in any other projects

       heavy development.

  <sect2 id="documentation">
   <title>Documentation</title>

   <para>
    A huge number of otherwise fantastic free software applications
    have withered and died because their author was the only person
    who knew how to use them fully. Even if your program is written
    primarily for a techno-savvy group of users, documentation is
    helpful and even necessary for the survival of your project. You
    will learn later in <xref linkend="releasing"> that you should
    always release something that is usable. <emphasis>A piece of
    software without documentation is not usable.</emphasis>
   </para>

   <para>
    There are lots of different people you should document for and
    there are lots of ways to document your project. <emphasis>The
    importance of documentation in source code to help facilitate
    development by a large community is vital</emphasis> but it falls
    outside the scope of this HOWTO. This being the case, this section
    deals with useful tactics for user-directed documentation.
   </para>

   <para>
    A combination of tradition and necessity has resulted in a
    semi-regular system of documentation in most free software
    projects that is worth following. Both users and developers expect
    to be able to get documentation in several ways and it's essential
    that you provide the information they are seeking in a form they
    can read if your project is ever going to get off the
    ground. People have come to expect:
   </para>

   <sect3>
    <title>Man pages</title> 

    <para>Your users will want to be able to type <quote>man
    yourprojectname</quote> end up with a nicely formatted man page
    highlighting the basic use of your application. Make sure that
    before you release your program, you've planned for this.
    </para>

    <para>
     Man pages are not difficult to write. There is excellent
     documentation on the man page writing process available through
     the <quote>The Linux Man-Page-HOWTO</quote> which is available
     through the Linux Documentation project <acronym>(LDP)</acronym>
     and is written by Jens Schweikhardt. It is available <ulink

     Schweikhardt's site</ulink> or <ulink

     <acronym>LDP</acronym></ulink>.
    </para>

    <para>
     It is also possible to write man pages using DocBook
     SGML. Because man pages are so simple and the DocBook method
     relatively new, I have not been able to follow this up but would
     love help from anyone who can give me more information on how
     exactly how this is done.

   <sect3>
    <title>Command line accessible documentation</title>

    <para>
     Most users will expect some basic amount of documentation to be
     easily available from the command line. For few programs should
     this type of documentation extend for more than one screen (24 or
     25 lines) but it should cover the basic usage, a brief (one or
     two sentence) description of the program, a list of the commands
     with explanations, as well as all the major options (also with
     explanations), plus a pointer to more in-depth documentation for
     those who need it. The command line documentation for Debian's
     apt-get serves as an excellent example and a useful model:
    </para>

    <screen>
apt 0.3.19 for i386 compiled on May 12 2000  21:17:27
Usage: apt-get [options] command
       apt-get [options] install pkg1 [pkg2 ...]

apt-get is a simple command line interface for downloading and
installing packages. The most frequently used commands are update
and install.

Commands:
   update - Retrieve new lists of packages
   upgrade - Perform an upgrade
   install - Install new packages (pkg is libc6 not libc6.deb)
   remove - Remove packages
   source - Download source archives
   dist-upgrade - Distribution upgrade, see apt-get(8)
   dselect-upgrade - Follow dselect selections
   clean - Erase downloaded archive files
   autoclean - Erase old downloaded archive files
   check - Verify that there are no broken dependencies

Options:
  -h  This help text.
  -q  Loggable output - no progress indicator
  -qq No output except for errors
  -d  Download only - do NOT install or unpack archives
  -s  No-act. Perform ordering simulation
  -y  Assume Yes to all queries and do not prompt
  -f  Attempt to continue if the integrity check fails
  -m  Attempt to continue if archives are unlocatable
  -u  Show a list of upgraded packages as well
  -b  Build the source package after fetching it
  -c=? Read this configuration file
  -o=? Set an arbitary configuration option, eg -o dir::cache=/tmp
See the apt-get(8), sources.list(5) and apt.conf(5) manual
pages for more information and options.
    </screen>

    <para>
     It has become a GNU convention to make this type of information
     accessible with the <quote>-h</quote> and the
     <quote>--help</quote> options. Most GNU/Linux users will expect
     to be able to retrieve basic documentation these ways so if you
     choose to use different methods, be prepared for the flames and
     fallout that may result.

    <title>Files users will expect</title>

     In addition to man pages and command-line help, there are certain
     files where people will look for documentation, especially in any
     package containing source code. In a source distribution, most of
     these files can be stored in the root directory of the source
     distribution or in a subdirectory of the root called
     <quote>doc</quote> or <quote>Documentation.</quote> Common files
     in these places include:

	maintain a CHANGELOG is to simply keep a file with the source

	CHANGELOG with each release describing what has been changed,
	fixed, or added to the program. It's a good idea to post the

     It's only indirectly an issue of documentation but a good website

     that details the process of getting involved with development or
     testing and make an open invitation. It should also supply links

     to all the available ways of downloading your software.

        All your documentation should be in plaintext, or, in cases
        where it is on your website primarily, in HTML. Everyone can
        cat a file, everyone has a pager, (almost) everyone can render
        HTML. <emphasis>You are welcome to distribute information in
        PDF, PostScript, RTF, or any number of other widely used
        formats but this information must also be available in
        plaintext or HTML or people will be very angry at
        you.</emphasis> In my opinion, info falls into this category
        as well. There is plenty of great GNU documentation that
        people simply don't read because it only in info. And this
        <emphasis>does</emphasis> make people angry. It's not a
        question of superior formats; it is a question of
        accessability and the status quo plays a huge role in this
        determination.

     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       It doesn't hurt to distribute any documentation for your
       program from your website (FAQs etc) with your program. Don't
       hesitate to throw any of this in the program's tarball. If
       people don't need it, they will delete it. I can repeat it over
       and over: <emphasis>Too much documentation is not a
       sin.</emphasis>
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>Unless your software is particular to a non-English
      language (a Japanese language editor for example), please
      distribute it with English language documentation. If you don't
      speak English or not confident in your skills, ask a friend
      for help. Like it or not, fair or unfair, <emphasis>English is
      the language of free software</emphasis>. However, this does not
      mean you should limit your documentation to only English. If you
      speak another language, distribute translations of documentation
      with your software if you have the time and energy to do
      so. They will invariably be useful to someone.</para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Finally, <emphasis>please spell-check your
       documentation.</emphasis> Misspellings in documentation are
       bugs. I'm very guilty of committing this error and it's
       extremely easy to do. If English is not your first language,
       have a native speaker look over or edit your documentation or
       web pages. Poor spelling or grammar goes a long way to making
       your code look unprofessional. In code comments, this type of
       thing is less important but in man pages and web pages these
       mistakes are not acceptable.

    Many of the remaining issues surrounding the creation of a new
    free software program fall under what most people describe as
    common sense issues. Its often said that software engineering is
    90 percent common sense combined with 10 percent specialized
    knowledge. Still, they are worth noting briefly in hopes that they
    may remind a developer of something they may have forgotten.

    <title>Package File Names</title> 
    <para>
     I agree with ESR when he says that: <quote> It's helpful to
     everybody if your archive files all have GNU-like names --
     all-lower-case alphanumeric stem prefix, followed by a dash,
     followed by a version number, extension, and other
     suffixes.</quote> There is more info (including lots of examples
     of what <emphasis>not</emphasis> to do in his <citetitle>Software

   <sect3>
    <title>Package formats</title>
    <para>
     Package formats may differ depending on the system you are
     developing for. For windows based software, Zip archives (.zip)
     usually serve as the package format of choice. If you are
     developing for GNU/Linux, *BSD, or any UN*X, make sure that your
     source code is always available in tar'ed and gzip'ed format
     (.tar.gz). UNIX compress (.Z) has gone out of style and
     usefulness and faster computers have brought bzip2 (.bz2) into
     the spot-light as a more effective compression medium. I now make
     all my releases available in both gzip'ed and bzip2'ed tarballs.
    </para>

    <para>
     Binary packages should always be distribution specific. If you
     can build binary packages against a current version of a major
     distribution, you will only make your users happy. Try to foster
     relationships with users or developers of large distributions to
     develop a system for the consistent creation of binary
     packages. It's often a good idea to provide RedHat
     <acronym>RPM</acronym>'s (.rpm), Debian deb's (.deb) and source
     <acronym>RPM</acronym>'s <acronym>SRPM</acronym>'s if
     possible. Remember: <emphasis>While these binaries packages are
     nice, getting the source packaged and released should always be
     your priority. Your users or fellow developers can and will do
     the binary packages for you.</emphasis>

    <title>Version control systems</title>

    <para>
     A version control system can make a lot of these problems of
     packaging (and a lot of other problems mentioned in this HOWTO)
     less problematic. If you are using *NIX, CVS is your best bet. I
     recommend Karl Fogel's book on the subject (and the <ulink
     url="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/">posted HTML version</ulink>)
     wholeheartedly.
    </para>

    <para>
     CVS or not, you should probably invest some time into learning
     about a version control system because it provides an automated
     way of solving many of the problems described by this HOWTO.  I
     am not aware of any free version control systems for Windows or
     Mac OS but I know that CVS clients exist for both
     platforms. Websites like <ulink
     url="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</ulink> do a great job
     as well with a nice, easy-to-use web interface to CVS.
    </para>

    <para>
     I'd love to devote more space in this HOWTO to CVS because I love
     it (I even use CVS to keep versions straight on this HOWTO!) but
     I think it falls outside the scope of this document and already
     has its own HOWTOs. Most notably is the <citetitle>CVS Best

        effective technique is a provide a symlink called

        to the most recent released or development version of your

        if you ever decide to hand over maintainership or if your
        email address changes, you simply need to change where this
        email address forwards. It also will allow for more than one

  <para>
   Once you have gotten your project started, you have overcome the
   most difficult hurdles in the development process of your
   program. Laying a firm foundation is essential, but the development
   process itself is equally important and provides just as many
   opportunities for failure. In the next two sections, I will
   describe running a project by discussing how to maintain a
   development effort through interactions with developers and with
   users.
  </para>

  <para>
   In releasing your program, your program becomes free software. This
   transition is more than just a larger user base. By releasing your
   program as free software, <emphasis>your</emphasis> software
   becomes the <emphasis>free software community's</emphasis>
   software. The direction of your software's development will be
   reshaped, redirected, and fully determined by your users and, to a
   larger extent, by other developers in the community.
  </para>

  <para>
   The major difference between free software development and
   propriety software development is the developer base. As the leader
   of a free software project, you need to attract and keep developers
   in a way that leaders of proprietary software projects simply don't
   have to worry about. <emphasis>As the person leading development of
   a free software project, you must harness the work of fellow
   developers by making responsible decisions and by responsibly
   choosing not to make decisions. You have to direct developers
   without being overbearing or bossy. You need to strive to earn
   respect and never forget to give it out.</emphasis>

   <title>Delegating Work</title>

   <para>
    By now, you've hypothetically followed me through the early
    programming of a piece of software, the creation of a website and
    system of documentation, and we've gone ahead and (as will be
    discussed in <xref linkend="releasing">) released it to the rest
    of the world. Times passes, and if things go well, people become
    interested and want to help. The patches begin flowing in.

    <emphasis>Like the parent of any child who grows up, it's now time
    to wince, smile and do most difficult thing in any parents
    life: It's time to let go.</emphasis>
   </para>

   <para>
    Delegation is the political way of describing this process of
    <quote>letting go.</quote> It is the process of handing some of
    the responsibility and power over your project to other
    responsible and involved developers. It is difficult for anyone
    who has invested a large deal of time and energy into a project
    but it essential for the growth of any free software project. One
    person can only do so much. A free software project is nothing
    without the involvement of <emphasis>a group</emphasis> of
    developers. A group of developers can only be maintained through
    respectful and responsible leadership and delegation.
   </para>

   <para>
    As your project progresses, you will notice people who are putting
    significant amounts of time and effort into your project. These
    will be the people submitting the most patches, posting most on
    the mailing lists, and engaging in long email discussions. It is
    your responsibility to contact these people and to try and shift
    some of the power and responsibility of your position as the
    project's maintainer onto them (if they want it). There are
    several easy ways you can do this:
   </para>

   <para>
    In a bit of a disclaimer, delegation need not mean rule by
    committee. In many cases it does and this has been proven to
    work. In other cases this has created problems. <ulink
    url="http://news.linuxprogramming.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2000-10-31-001-05-CD">Managing
    Projects the Open Source Way</ulink> argues that <quote>OSS
    projects do best when one person is the clear leader of a team and
    makes the big decisions (design changes, release dates, and so
    on).</quote> I think this often true but would urge developers to
    consider the ideas that the project leader need not be the
    project's founder and that these important powers need not all rest
    with one person but that a release manager may be different than a
    lead developer. These situations are tricky politically so
    be careful and make sure it's necessary before you go around
    empowering people.
   </para>

   <sect3>
    <title>How to delegate</title>
 
    <para>
     You may find that other developers seem even more experienced or
     knowledgeable than you. Your job as a maintainer does not mean
     you have to be the best or the brightest. It means you
     are responsible for showing good judgment and for
     recognizing which solutions are maintainable and which are not. 
    </para>
    <para>
     Like anything, its easier to watch others delegate than to do it
     yourself. In a sentence: <emphasis>Keep an eye out for other
     qualified developers who show an interest and sustained
     involvement with your project and try and shift responsibility
     toward them.</emphasis> The following ideas might be good places
     to start or good sources of inspiration:

    <sect4>
     <title>Allow a larger group of people to have write access to your CVS
     repository and make real efforts toward rule by a
     committee</title>

     <para>
      <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</ulink> is an
      example of a project that is run by small group of developers
      who vote on major technical issues and the admission of new
      members and all have write access to the main source
      repository. Their process is detailed <ulink
      url="http://httpd.apache.org/ABOUT_APACHE.html">online.</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      The <ulink url="http://www.debian.org/"> Debian Project</ulink>
      is an extreme example of rule by committee. At current count,
      more than 700 developers have full responsibility for
      aspects of the project. All these developers can upload into
      the main FTP server, and vote on major issues. Direction for
      the project is determined by the project's <ulink
      url="http://www.debian.org/social_contract">social
      contract</ulink> and a <ulink
      url="http://www.debian.org/devel/constitution">constitution</ulink>. To
      facilitate this system, there are special teams (i.e. the
      install team, the Japanese language team) as well as a technical
      committee and a project leader. The leader's main responsibility
      is to, <quote>appoint delegates or delegate decisions to the
      Technical Committee.</quote>
     </para>

     <para>
      While both of these projects operate on a scale that your
      project will not (at least initially), their example is
      helpful. Debian's idea of a project leader who can do
      <emphasis>nothing</emphasis> but delegate serves as a
      caricature of how a project can involve and empower a huge
      number of developers and grow to a huge size.

      stability and quality control, packaging up the software, and
      placing it in the appropriate places to be downloaded.
     </para>

     <para>
      This use of the release manager is a good way to give yourself a
      break and to shift the responsibility for accepting and
      rejecting patches onto someone else. It is a good way of very
      clearly defining a chunk of work on the project as belonging to

    <para>As the person managing or maintaining the project, you

    dealing with bug fixes that often don't come in the form of
    patches at all. Of course, this doesn't mean that I
    <emphasis>like</emphasis> getting poorly done patches. If you get

     </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
     These are the criteria that you as a project maintainer should
     take into account each time you receive a patch.
    </para>

    <para>
     Fogel elaborates on this and states the <quote>the
     questions to ask yourself when considering whether to implement
     (or approve) a change are:</quote>
    </para>

    <para>
     <itemizedlist>

      <listitem>
       <para>Will it benefit a significant percentage of the program's

    </para>

    <para>
     The answers to these questions are never straightforward and its
     very possible (and even likely) that the person who submitted the
     patch may feel differently about the answer to these questions
     than you do. However, if you feel that the answer to either
     of those questions is <quote>no,</quote> it is your responsibility
     to reject the change. If you fail to do this, the project will
     become unwieldy and unmaintainable and many ultimately fail.
    </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3>
    <title>Rejecting patches</title>

    <para>
     Rejecting patches is probably the most difficult and sensitive
     job that the maintainer of any free software project has to
     face. But sometimes it has to be done. I mentioned earlier (in
     <xref linkend="developers"> and in <xref linkend="delegation">)
     that you need to try and balance your responsibility and power to
     make what you think are the best technical decisions with the
     fact that you will lose support from other developers if you seem
     like you are on a power trip or being overly bossy or possessive
     of the community's project. I recommend that you keep these three
     major concepts in mind when rejecting patches (or other changes):
    </para>

    <sect4>
     <title>Bring it to the community</title>
     <para>
      One of the best ways of justifying a decision to reject a patch
      and working to not seem like you keep an iron grip on your
      project is by not making the decision alone at all. It might
      make sense to turn over larger proposed changes or more
      difficult decisions to a development mailing list where they can
      be discussed and debated. There will be some patches (bug fixes,
      etc.) which will definitely be accepted and some that you feel
      are so off base that they do not even merit further
      discussion. It is those that fall into the gray area between
      these two groups that might merit a quick forward to a mailing
      list.
     </para>

     <para>
      I recommend this process wholeheartedly. As the project
      maintainer you are worried about making the best decision for
      the project, for the project's users and developers, and for
      yourself as a responsible project leader. Turning things over to
      an email list will demonstrate your own responsibility and
      responsive leadership as it tests and serves the interests of
      your software's community.
     </para>
    </sect4>

    <sect4>
     <title>Technical issues are not always good justification</title>
     <para>
      Especially toward the beginning of your project's life, you
      will find that many changes are difficult to implement,
      introduce new bugs, or have other technical problems. Try to see
      past these. Especially with added functionality, good ideas do
      not always come from good programmers. Technical merit is a
      valid reason to postpone an application of a patch but it is not
      always a good reason to reject a change outright. Even small
      changes are worth the effort of working with the developer
      submitting the patch to iron out bugs and incorporate the change
      if you think it seems like a good addition to your project. The
      effort on your part will work to make your project a community
      project and it will pull a new or less experienced developer
      into your project and even teach them something that might help
      them in making their next patch.
     </para>
    </sect4>

    <sect4>
     <title>Common courtesy</title>
     <para>
      It should go without saying but, <emphasis>above all and in all
      cases, just be nice.</emphasis> If someone has an idea and cares
      about it enough to write some code and submit a patch, they
      care, they are motivated, and they are already involved. Your
      goal as the maintainer is make sure they submit again. They may
      have thrown you a dud this time but next time may be the idea or
      feature that revolutionizes your project. 
     </para>

  <sect2 id="branches">
   <title>Stable and Development Branches</title>

   <para>
    The idea of stable and development branches has already been
    described briefly in <xref linkend="chooseversioning"> and in
    <xref linkend="delegatebranch">. These allusions attest to some of
    the ways that multiple branches can affect your software. Branches
    can let you avoid (to some extent) some of the problems around
    rejecting patches (as described in <xref linkend="patching">) by
    allowing you to temporarily compromise the stability of your
    project without affecting those users who need that stability.
   </para>

   <para>
    The most common way of branching your project is to have one
    branch that is stable and one that is for development. This is the
    model followed by the Linux kernel that is described in <xref
    linkend="chooseversioning">. In this model, there is
    <emphasis>always</emphasis> one branch that is stable and always
    one that is in development. Before any new release, the
    development branch goes into a <quote>feature freeze</quote> as
    described in <xref linkend="freezing"> where major changes and
    added features are rejected or put on hold under the development
    kernel is released as the new stable branch and major development
    resumes on the development branch. Bug fixes and small changes
    that are unlikely to have any large negative repercussions are
    incorporated into the stable branch as well as the development
    branch.
   </para>

   <para>
    Linux's model provides an extreme example. On many projects, there is no
    need to have two versions constantly available. It may make sense to
    have two versions only near a release. The Debian project has
    historically made both a stable and an unstable distribution
    available but has expanded to this to include: stable, unstable,
    testing, experimental, and (around release time) a frozen
    distribution that only incorporates bug fixes during the
    transition from unstable to stable. There are few projects whose
    size would necessitate a system like Debian's but this use of
    branches helps demonstrate how they can be used to balance
    consistent and effective development with the need to make regular
    and usable releases.
   </para>

   <para>
    In trying to set up a development tree for yourself, there are
    several things that might be useful to keep in mind:
   </para>

   <para>
    <variablelist>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>Minimize the number of branches</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>Debian may be able to make good use of four or five
       branches but it contains gigabytes of software in over 5000
       packages compiled for 5-6 different architectures. For you,
       two is probably a good ceiling. Too many branches will confuse
       your users (I can't count how many times I had to describe
       Debian's system when it only had 2 and sometimes 3 branches!),
       potential developers and even yourself. Branches can help but
       they come at a cost so use them very sparingly.</para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>Make sure that all your different branches are explained</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>As I mentioned in the preceding paragraph, different
       branches <emphasis>will</emphasis> confuse your users. Do
       everything you can to avoid this by clearly explaining the
       different branches in a prominent page on your website and in a
       README file in the <acronym>FTP</acronym> or
       web directory.</para>

       <para>
        I might also recommend against a mistake that I think Debian
        has made. The terms <quote>unstable,</quote>
        <quote>testing,</quote> and <quote>experimental</quote> are
        vague and difficult to rank in order of stability (or
        instability as the case may be). Try explaining to someone
        that <quote>stable</quote> actually means <quote>ultra
        stable</quote> and that <quote>unstable</quote> doesn't
        actually include any unstable software but is really stable
        software that is untested as a distribution.
       </para>

       <para>
        If you are going to use branches, especially early on, keep in
        mind that people are conditioned to understand the terms
        <quote>stable</quote> and <quote>development</quote> and you
        probably can't go wrong with this simple and common division of
        branches.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>Make sure all your branches are always available</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>Like a lot of this document, this should probably should
       go without saying but experience has taught me that it's not
       always obvious to people. It's a good idea to physically split
       up different branches into different directories or directory
       trees on your <acronym>FTP</acronym> or web site. Linux
       accomplishes this by having kernels in a v2.2 and a v2.3
       subdirectory where it is immediately obvious (after you know
       their version numbering scheme) which directory is for the most
       recent stable and the current development releases. Debian
       accomplishes this by naming all their distribution with names
       (i.e. woody, potato, etc.) and then changing symlinks named
       <quote>stable,</quote> <quote>unstable</quote> and
       <quote>frozen</quote> to point to which ever distribution (by
       name) is in whatever stage. Both methods work and there are
       others. In any case, it is important that different branches
       are always available, are accessible from consistent locations,
       and that different branches are clearly distinguished from each
       other so your users know exactly what they want and where to
       get it.</para>

   <title>Other Project Management issues</title>
   <para>
    There are more issues surrounding interaction with developers in a
    free software project that I can not touch on in great detail in a
    HOWTO of this size and scope. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you see
    any major omissions.
   </para>

   <para>
     Other smaller issues that are worth mentioning are:
   </para>

   <sect3 id="freezing">
    <title>Freezing</title>
    <para>
     For those projects that choose to adopt a split development model
     (<xref linkend="branches">), freezing is a concept that is worth
     becoming familiar with. 
    </para>

    <para>
     Freezes come in two major forms. A <quote>feature freeze</quote>
     is a period when no significant functionality is added to a
     program. It is a period where established functionality (even
     skeletons of barely working functionality) can be improved and
     perfected. It is a period where bugs are fixed. This type of
     freeze is usually applied some period (a month or two) before a
     release. It is easy to push a release back as you wait for
     <quote>one more feature</quote> and a freeze helps to avoid this
     situation by drawing the much needed line in the sand. It gives
     developers room they need to get a program ready for release.
    </para>

    <para>
     The second type of freeze is a <quote>code freeze</quote> which
     is much more like a released piece of software. Once a piece of
     software has entered a <quote>code freeze,</quote> all changes to
     the code are discouraged and only changes that fix known bugs
     are permitted. This type of freeze usually follows a
     <quote>feature freeze</quote> and directly precedes a
     release. Most released software is in what could be interpreted
     as a sort of high level <quote>code freeze.</quote>
    </para>

    <para>
     Even if you never choose to appoint a release manager (<xref
     linkend="releasemanager">), you will have an easier time
     justifying the rejection or postponement of patches (<xref
     linkend="patching">) before a release with a publicly stated
     freeze in effect.

    <title>Forks</title>
    <para>
     I wasn't sure about how I would deal with forking in this
     document (or if I would deal with forking at all). A fork is when
     a group of developers takes code from a free software project and
     actually starts a brand new free software project with it. The
     most famous example of a fork was between Emacs and XEmacs. Both
     emacsen are based on an identical code-base but for technical,
     political, and philosophical reasons, development was split into
     two projects which now compete with each other.
    </para>

    <para>
     The short version of the fork section is, <emphasis>don't do
     them.</emphasis> Forks force developers to choose one project to
     work with, cause nasty political divisions, and redundancy of
     work.  Luckily, usually the threat of the fork is enough to scare
     the maintainer or maintainers of a project into changing the way
     they run their project.
    </para>

    <para>
     In his chapter on <quote>The Open Source Process,</quote> Karl
     Fogel describes how to do a fork if you absolutely must. If you
     have determined that is absolutely necessary and that the
     differences between you and the people threatening to fork are
     absolutely unresolvable, I recommend Fogel's book as a good place
     to start.

  <title>Maintaining a Project: Interacting with Users</title>

  </indexterm>

  <para>
   If you've worked your way up to here, congratulations, you are
   nearing the end of this document. This final section describes some
   of the situations in which you, in your capacity as project
   maintainer, will be interacting with users. It gives some
   suggestions on how these situations might be handled effectively.
  </para>

  <para>
   Interacting with users is difficult. In our discussion of
   interaction with developers, the underlying assumption is that in a
   free software project, a project maintainer must constantly strive to
   attract and keep developers who can easily leave at any time.
  </para>

  <para>
   Users in the free software community are different than developers
   and are also different than users in the world of proprietary
   software and they should be treated differently than either
   group. Some ways in which the groups differ significantly follow:
  </para>

  <para>
   <itemizedlist>

    <listitem>
     <para>The lines between users and developers are blurred in ways
     that is totally foreign to any proprietary development
     model. Your users are often your developers and vice
     versa.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>In the free software world, you are often your users' only
     choice. Because there is such an emphasis on not replicating the
     work of others in the free software community and because the
     element of competition present in the propriety software model is
     absent (or at least in an extremely different form) in the free
     software development model, you will probably be the only project
     that does what you do (or at least the only one that does what
     you do in the way that you do it). This means your responsiveness
     to your users is even more important than in the proprietary
     software world.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>In an almost paradoxical situation, free software projects
     have less immediate or dire consequences for ignoring their users
     altogether. It is also often easier to do. Because you don't
     usually need to compete with another product, chances are good
     that you will not be scrambling to gain the features of your
     competitor's newest program. This means that your development
     process will have to be directed either internally, by a
     commitment to your users, or through both.</para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
   Trying to tackle this unique situation can only be done
   indirectly. Developers and maintainers need to listen to users and
   to try and be as responsive as possible. A solid knowledge of the
   situation recounted above is any free software developer's best tool
   for shifting his development or leadership style to fit the unique
   process of free software project management. This chapters will try and
   introduce some of the more difficult or important points in any
   projects interactions with users and give some hints on how to
   tackle these.

   <title>Testing and Testers</title>

   <para>
    In addition to your users being your developers, they are also
    (and perhaps more commonly) your testers. Before I get flamed, I
    should rephrase my sentence: <emphasis>some of your
    users</emphasis> (those who explicitly volunteer) are your
    testers.
   </para>

   <para>
    It is important that this distinction be made early on because not
    all of your users want to be testers. Many users want to use
    stable software and don't care if they don't have the newest,
    greatest software with the latest, greatest features. These users
    except a stable, tested piece of software without major or obvious
    bugs and will be angry if they find themselves testing. This is
    yet another way in which a split development model (as mentioned

    <title>Automated testing</title>
    <para>
     For many programs, many common mistakes can be caught by
     automated means. Automated tests tend to be pretty good at
     catching errors that you've run into several times before or
     the things you just forget. They are not very good at finding
     errors, even major ones, that are totally unforeseen.
    </para>

    <para>
     CVS comes with a Bourne shell script called sanity.sh that is
     worth looking at. Debian uses a program called lintian that
     checks Debian packages for all of the most common errors. While
     use of these scripts may not be helpful, there is a host of other
     sanity checking software on the net that may be applicable (feel
     free to email me any recommendations). None of these will create
     a bug-free release but they will avoid at least some major
     oversights. Finally, if your programs become a long term
     endeavor, you will find that there are certain errors that you
     tend to make over and over. Start a collection of scripts that
     check for these errors to help keep them out of future releases.

   <sect3>
    <title>Testing by testers</title>
    <para>
     For any program that depends on user interactivity, many bugs
     will only be uncovered through testing by users actually clicking
     the keys and pressing the mouse buttons. For this you need
     testers and as many as possible.
    </para>

    <para>
     The most difficult part of testing is finding testers. It's
     usually a good tactic to post a message to a relevant mailing
     list or news group announcing a specific proposed release date
     and outlining the functionality of your program. If you put some
     time into the announcement, you are sure to get a few responses.

   <title>Setting up Support Infrastructure</title>

   <para>
    While testing is important, the large part of your interactions
    and responsibility to your users falls under the category of
    support. The best way to make sure your users are adequately
    supported in using your program is to set up a good infrastructure
    for this purpose so that your developers and users help each other
    and less of the burden falls on you. This way, people will also
    get quicker and better responses to their questions. This
    infrastructure comes in several major forms:
   </para>

   <sect3>
    <title>Documentation</title>
    <para>
     It should not come as any surprise that the key element to any
     support infrastructure is good documentation. This topic was
     largely covered in <xref linkend="documentation"> and will not be
     repeated here.
    </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3 id="mailinglists">
    <title>Mailing lists</title>
    <para>
     Aside from documentation, effective mailing lists will be your
     greatest tool in providing user support. Running a mailing list
     well is more complicated than installing mailing list software
     onto a machine.
    </para>

    <sect4>
     <title>Separate lists</title>
     
     <para>
      A good idea is too separate your user and development mailing
      lists (perhaps into project-user@host and project-devel@host)
      and enforce the division. If people post a development question
      onto -user, politely ask them to repost it onto -devel and vise
      versa. Subscribe yourself to both groups and encourage all
      primarily developers to do the same.
     </para>

     <para>
      This system provides so that no one person is stuck doing all of

    <sect4>
     <title>Choose mailing list software well</title>
     <para>
      Please don't make the selection of mailing list software
      impulsively. Please consider easy accessibility by users without
      a lot of technical experience so you want to be as easy as
      possible. Web accessibility to an archive of the list is also
      important.
     </para>

     <para>
      The two biggest free software mailing list programs are <ulink
      url="http://www.greatcircle.com/majordomo/">majordomo</ulink>
      and <ulink url="http://www.list.org/">GNU Mailman</ulink>. A
      long time advocate of majordomo, I would now recommend any
      project choose GNU Mailman. It fulfills the criteria listed
      above and makes it easier. It provides a good mailing
      list program for a free software project maintainer as opposed
      to a good mailing list application for a mailing list
      administrator.
     </para>

     <para>
      There are other things you want to take into consideration in
      setting up your list. If it is possible to gate your mailing
      lists to Usenet and provide it in digest form as well as

      and work to make the support infrastructure slightly more
      accessible.

      addresses, and ways to reach you via <acronym>ICQ</acronym>,

    <sect4>
     <title>Bug management software</title>
     <para>
      For many large software projects, use of bug management software
      is essential to keep track of which bugs have been fixed, which
      bugs have not been fixed, and which bugs are being fixed by
      which people. Debian uses the <ulink
      url="http://bugs.debian.org">Debian Bug Tracking System</ulink>
      (<acronym>BTS</acronym>) although it may not be best choice for
      every project (it seems to currently be buckling under its own
      weight) As well as a damn good web browser, the Mozilla project
      has spawned a sub-project resulting in a bug tracking system
      called <ulink
      url="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/bugzilla/">bugzilla</ulink>
      which has become extremely possible and which I like a lot.
     </para>

     <para>
      These systems (and others like them) can be unwieldy so
      developers should be careful to not spend more time on the bug
      tracking system than on the bugs or the projects themselves. If
      a project continues to grow, use of a bug tracking system can
      provide an easy standard avenue for users and testers to report
      bugs and for developers and maintainers to fix them and track
      them in an orderly fashion.

<!-- Section2: releasing -->

  <sect2 id="releasing">
   <title>Releasing Your Program</title>

   <para>
    As mentioned earlier in the HOWTO, the first rule of releasing is,
    <emphasis>release something useful.</emphasis> Non-working or
    not-useful software will not attract anyone to your
    project. People will be turned off of your project and will be likely
    to simply gloss over it next time they see a new version
    announced. Half-working software, if useful, will intrigue people,
    whet their appetites for versions to come, and encourage them to
    join the development process.
   </para>

   <sect3>
    <title>When to release</title>

    <para>
     Making the decision to release your software for the first time
     is an incredibly important and incredibly stressful decision. But
     it needs to  done. My advice is to try and make something that
     is complete enough to be usable and incomplete enough to allow
     for flexibility and room for imagination by your future
     developers. It's not an easy decision. Ask for help on a local
     Linux User Group mailing list or from a group of developer
     friends.
    </para>

    <para>
     One tactic is to first do an <quote>alpha</quote> or
     <quote>beta</quote> release as described below in <xref
     linkend="alphabeta">. However, most of the guidelines described
     above still apply.
    </para>

    <para>
     <emphasis>When you feel in your gut that it is time and you feel
     you've weighed the situation well several times, cross your
     fingers and take the plunge.</emphasis>
   </para>

    <para>
     After you've released for the first time, knowing when to release
     becomes less stressful, but just as difficult to gauge. I like
     the criteria offered by Robert Krawitz in his article, <ulink
     url="http://www.advogato.org/article/196.html"><quote>Free
     Software Project Management</quote></ulink> for maintaining a
     good release cycle. He recommends that you ask yourself,
     <quote>does this release...</quote>
    </para>

    <para>
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>Contain sufficient new functionality or bug fixes to be
       worth the effort.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>Be spaced sufficiently far apart to allow the user time
       to work with the latest release.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>Be sufficiently functional so that the user can get work
       done (quality).</para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
     If the answer is yes to all of these questions, its probably time
     for a release. If in doubt, remember that asking for advice can't
     hurt.

   <sect3>
    <title>How to release</title>

    <para>
     If you've followed the guidelines described in this HOWTO up
     until this point, the mechanics of doing a release are going to
     be the easy part of releasing. If you have set up consistent
     distribution locations and the other infrastructure described in
     the preceding sections, releasing should be as simple as building
     the package, checking it once over, and uploading it into the
     appropriate place and then making your website reflect the
     change.
    </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3 id="alphabeta">
    <title>Alpha, beta, and development releases</title>

    <para>
     When contemplating releases, it worth considering the fact that
     not every release needs to be a full numbered release. Software
     users are accustomed to pre-releases but you must be careful to
     label these releases accurately or they will cause more problems then
     they are worth.
    </para>

    <para>
     The observation is often made that many free software developers

     the phrase, <quote>Alpha is not Beta. Beta is not Release</quote>
     and I'd agree that tis is a probably a good idea.

<!-- Section2: announcing  -->

  <sect2 id="announcing">
   <title>Announcing Your Project</title>

   <para>
    Well, you've done it. You've (at least for the purposes of this
    HOWTO) designed, built, and released your free software
    project. All that is left is for you to tell the world so they
    know to come and try it out and hopefully jump on board with
    development. If everything is in order as described above, this
    will be a quick and painless process. A quick announcement is all
    that it takes to put yourself on the free software community's
    radar screen.
   </para>

   <sect3>
    <title>Mailing lists and Usenet</title>

    <para>Announce your software on Usenet's <ulink
    url="news:comp.os.linux.announce">comp.os.linux.announce</ulink>. If
    you only announce your software in two places, have it be c.o.l.a
    and freshmeat.</para>

    <para>
     However, email is still the way that most people on the Internet
     get their information. Its a good idea to send a message
     announcing your program to any relevant mailing list you know of
     and any other relevant Usenet discussion groups.</para>

    <para>Karl Fogel recommends that use you simple subject
     describing the fact that the message is an announcement, the name
     of the program, the version, and a half-line long description of
     its functionality. This way, any interested user or developer
     will be immediately attracted to your announcement. Fogel's
     example looks like:
    </para>

    <screen>Subject: ANN: aub 1.0, a program to assemble Usenet binaries</screen>

    <para>
     The rest of the email should describe the programs functionality
     quickly and concisely in no more than two paragraphs and should
     provide links to the projects webpage and direct links to
     downloads for those that want to try it right away. This form
     will work for both Usenet and mailing list posts.
    </para>

    <para>
     You should repeat this announcement process consistently in the
     same locations for each subsequent release.
    </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3>
    <title>freshmeat.net</title>
    <para>
     Mentioned earlier in <xref linkend="evalwhere">, in today's free
     software community, announcements of your project on freshmeat
     are almost more important than announcements on mailing lists.
    </para>

    <para>
     Visit the <ulink url="http://freshmeat.net">freshmeat.net
     website</ulink> or their <ulink
     url="http://freshmeat.net/add-project/">submit project
     page</ulink> to post your project onto their site and into their
     database. In addition to a large website, freshmeat provides a
     daily newsletter that highlights all the days releases and
     reaches a huge audience (I personally skim it every night for any
     interesting new releases).
    </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3>
    <title>Project Mailing List</title>

    <para>If you've gone ahead and created mailing lists for your
    project, you should always announce new versions on these
    lists. I've found that for many projects, users request a very
    low-volume announce only mailing list to be notified when new
    versions are released. freshmeat.net now allows users to subscribe
    to a particular project so they receive emails every time a new
    version is announced through their system. It's free and it can
    stand in for an announce-only mailing list. In my opinion, it
    can't hurt.</para>

       While it only briefly talks about free software (and does it by

       done with law, but with the code itself and how the nature of
       the code will determine the nature of future freedoms. In
       addition to being a quick and enjoyable read, it gives some
       cool history and describes how we <emphasis>need</emphasis>

       job of sketching the free software process and does an
       amazing job of making an argument for free software/open source
       development as a road to better software. The rest of the book
       has other of ESR's articles, which for the most part are posted
       on his website. Still, it's nice thing to own in hard copy and
       something that every free software/open source hacker should
       read.

     <abstract>
      <para>Since the paper includes its own abstract, I thought I
      would include it here verbatim:</para>

      <para><blockquote><para>This paper examines the latest of
	paradigms - the Virtual Network(ed) Organisation - and whether
	geographically dispersed knowledge workers can virtually
	collaborate for a project under no central
	planning. Co-ordination, management and the role of knowledge
	arise as the central areas of focus. The Linux Project and its
	development model are selected as a case of analysis and the
	critical success factors of this organisational design are
	identified. The study proceeds to the formulation of a
	framework that can be applied to all kinds of virtual
	decentralised work and concludes that value creation is
	maximized when there is intense interaction and uninhibited
	sharing of information between the organisation and the
	surrounding community. Therefore, the potential success or
	failure of this organisational paradigm depends on the degree
	of dedication and involvement by the surrounding
	community.</para></blockquote></para>

      <para>This paper was referred to me in my capacity as author of
      this HOWTO and I was very impressed. It's written by a graduate
      student in management and I think it succeeds at evaluating the
      Linux project as an example of a new paradigm in management--one
      that <emphasis>you</emphasis> will be placing yourself at the
      center of in your capacity as maintainer of a free software
      project.</para>

      <para>As a developer trying to control an application and guide
      it to success in the free software world, I'm not sure how
      useful Dafermos's argument is. It does however, provide a
      theoretical justification for my HOWTO--free software project
      management <emphasis>is</emphasis> a different creature than
      proprietary software project management. If you are interested
      in the conceptual and theoretical ways that free software
      project management differs from other types of management, this
      is a great paper to read. If this paper answers questions of
      <quote>how?</quote>, Dafermos answers the (more difficult to
      defend) questions of <quote>why?</quote> and does a very good
      job.</para>

      will give a reader a good picture of how to go about managing a

      and what languages to write in. He tends to give more specific
      instructions and checklists (<quote>name this file this, not
      this</quote>) while this HOWTO speaks more conceptually. There
      are several sections that are extremely similar. It's also
      <emphasis>much</emphasis> shorter.</para>

      is fine (technical CVS HOWTO have been written) but CVS newbies
      will want to spend some time with Fogel's reference before they

      <para>Venugopalan creates checklists of things to do before,

       the subject usually do), the article talks a little about
       project management (<quote>Use it!</quote>) and a bit about
       communication within a free software project.

       This article touches upon the "writing maintainable code"
       discussion that I try hard to avoid in my HOWTO. It's one of
       the better (and most diplomatic) articles on the subject that
       I've found.

      <para>
       This article made me happy because it challenged many of the
       problems that I had with Monty's article on <ulink
       url="http://www.linuxprogramming.com">LinuxProgramming</ulink>. The
       author argues that Monty calls simply for the application of
       old (proprietary software) project management techniques in
       free software projects instead of working to come up with
       something new. I found his article to be extremely well thought
       out and I think it's an essential read for any free software
       project manager.

       While the article is little more than a question, reading the
       answers to this question offered by Advogato's readers can
       help. In a lot of ways, this HOWTO acts as my answer to the
       questions posed in this article but there are others, many of
       which might take issue with whats is in this HOWTO. It's worth

       describes some of the ways that you can get started with free
       software development without starting a project. I think this
       is an important article. If you are interested in becoming
       involved with free software, this article showcases some of the
       ways that you can do this without actually starting a project
       (something that I hope this HOWTO has demonstrated is not to be

    <para>
      The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
      other written document <quote>free</quote> in the sense of
      freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
      redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
      commercially or non-commercially. Secondarily, this License
      preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for
      their work, while not being considered responsible for
      modifications made by others.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      This License is a kind of <quote>copyleft</quote>, which means
      that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in
      the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License,
      which is a copyleft license designed for free software.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
      free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
      free program should come with manuals providing the same
      freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited
      to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
      regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
      printed book. We recommend this License principally for works
      whose purpose is instruction or reference.

      A <quote>Secondary Section</quote> is a named appendix or a

      Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
      matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within
      that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a
      textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
      mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
      connection with the subject or with related matters, or of

      A <quote>Transparent</quote> copy of the <link

      directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for
      images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for
      drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is
      suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
      translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
      formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format

      <quote>Opaque</quote>.

      Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
      plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input

      standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human

      proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD

    <para>
      If you publish printed copies of the <link

      and the Document's license notice requires <link
      linkend="fdl-cover-texts">Cover Texts</link>, you must enclose
      the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these
      Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
      Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also
      clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
      copies. The front cover must present the full title with all
      words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
      other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes
      limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the

      If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit

      each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
      publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a
      complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added
      material, which the general network-using public has access to
      download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network
      protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take
      reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
      copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
      remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
      year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly
      or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
      public.
