This document describes how to enable the Linux IP Masquerade feature on a 
given Linux host.  IP Masquerade is a form of Network Address Translation or 
NAT which NAT allows internally connected computers that do not have one or more 
registered Internet IP addresses to communicate to the Internet via the Linux 
server's Internet IP address.

<Title>Introduction to IP Masquerading or IP MASQ</Title>

<para>
This document describes how to enable the Linux IP Masquerade feature on a 
given Linux host.  IP Masquerade, called "IPMASQ" or "MASQ" for short, is a form 
of Network Address Translation (NAT) which allows internally connected computers 
that do not have one or more registered Internet IP addresses to communicate to 
the Internet via the Linux server's Internet IP address.  Since IPMASQ is a 
generic technology, you can connect the Linux server's internal and external 
to other computers through LAN technologies like Ethernet, TokenRing, and FDDI, 
as well as dialup connections line PPP or SLIP links. This document primarily 
uses Ethernet and PPP connections in examples because it is most commonly used with 
DSL /  Cablemodems and dialup connections.

This document is intended for systems running stable Linux kernels like 2.4.x,
2.2.x, and 2.0.x preferably on an IBM-compatible PC. IP Masquerade
does work on other Linux-supported platforms like Sparc, Alpha, PowerPC, etc. 
but this HOWTO doesn't cover them in as much detail.  Beta kernels 
such as 2.5.x, 2.3.x, 2.1.x, and ANY kernels less than 2.0.x are NOT covered 
in this document.  The primary reason for this is because many of the older
kernels are considered broken.  If you are using an older kernel version, it 
is highly advisable to upgrade to one of the stable Linux kernels before using 
IP Masquerading.

As a new user, I found it very confusing to setup IP masquerade on the Linux 
kernel, (back then, its was a 1.2.x kernel).  Although there was a FAQ and a 
mailing list, there was no documentation dedicated to this.  There was also 
some requests on the mailing list for a HOWTO manual.  So, I decided to write 
this HOWTO as a starting point for new users and possibly create a building 
block for other knowledgeable users.  If you, the reader, have any additional 
ideas, corrections, or questions about this document, please feel free to

This document was originally written by <ULink
URL="mailto:ambrose@writeme.com">Ambrose Au</Ulink> back in August, 1996, 
based on the 1.x kernel IPMASQ FAQ written by Ken Eves and numerous helpful     
messages from the original IP Masquerade mailing list.  In particular, a 
mailing list message from Matthew Driver inspired Ambrose to set up IP 
Masquerade and eventually write version 0.80 of this HOWTO.  In April 1997, 
Ambrose created the Linux IP Masquerade Resource Web site at 
<Ulink URL="http://ipmasq.webhop.net">http://ipmasq.webhop.net</Ulink> which has 
provided up-to-date information on Linux IP Masquerading ever since.  In 
February 1999, <ULink URL="dranch@trinnet.net">David Ranch</ULink> took over 
maintenance of the HOWTO.  David then re-wrote the HOWTO and added a 
substantial number of sections to the document.  Today, the HOWTO is still
maintained by David where he constantly updates it and fixes any reported bugs,
etc.

This HOWTO is meant to be a fairly comprehensive guide to getting your Linux

<Title>What is IP Masquerade?</Title>

<para>
IP Masquerade is a networking function in Linux similar to the one-to-many 
(1:Many) NAT (Network Address Translation) servers found in many commercial 
firewalls and network routers.  For example, if a Linux host is connected to 
the Internet via PPP, Ethernet, etc., the IP Masquerade feature allows other 
"internal" computers connected to this Linux box (via PPP, Ethernet, etc.) to 
also reach the Internet as well.  Linux IP Masquerading allows for this 
functionality even though these internal machines don't have 
<Emphasis role="strong">an officially assigned IP address</Emphasis>. 
</para>

<para>
MASQ allows a set of machines to <Emphasis role="strong">invisibly</Emphasis> 
access the Internet via the MASQ gateway.  To other machines on the Internet, 
the outgoing traffic will appear to be from the IP MASQ Linux server itself.  
In addition to the added functionality, IP Masquerade provides the foundation 
to create a HEAVILY secured networking environment.  With a well built firewall, 
breaking the security of a well configured masquerading system and internal 
LAN should be considerably difficult to accomplish. 
</para>

<para>
If you would like to know more on how MASQ (1:Many) differs from 1:1 (true) NAT 
and Proxy solutions, please see the <XRef LinkEnd="what-is-masq"> FAQ entry.
</para>

</Sect1>

<Sect1 id="ipmasq-background2.2">
<Title>Current Status</Title>

<para>
IP Masquerade has been in the Linux kernels for several years now and is quite 
mature as the kernel enters the 2.4.x stage.  Kernels since Linux 1.3.x have 
had MASQ support built-in.  Today, many individuals and commercial businesses 
are using it with excellent results.  
</para>

<para>
2.4.x kernel users:
<ItemizedList>
  <listitem>
  <para>
  The 2.4.x kernel hosts an entirely re-written set of NAT code which is 
  both far superior, faster, and more secure than any previous versions
  written for Linux.  Unfortunately, several kernel modules that were
  written for the 2.2.x kernel to support things like UDP-based RealAudio,
  etc. have not been ported to 2.4.x yet.  Because of this, some people 
  should consider NOT upgrading if these network applications are critical 
  to them.  But, at the same time, some of these programs have been updated
  and now use different, NAT-friendly protocols.  Thus special NAT treatment 
  is no longer required.  As always, please see the 
  <ULink URL="http://ipmasq.webhop.net/">http://ipmasq.webhop.net/: The IP 
  Masquerade Resources</ULink> site for updated news, etc.
  </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>


<para>
Common network functionalities like Web browsing, telnet, ssh, ping, 
traceroute, etc. work well over stock IP Masquerade setups.  Other network 
applications such as ftp, irc, and Real Audio work well with the appropriate 
additional IP MASQ modules loaded into the kernel as modules.  Other 
network-specific programs like streaming audio (MP3s, True Speech, etc) should
work too without any special module.  Some users on the mailing list also had 
good results with video conferencing software.   
</para>

<para>
It should be noted that running IP Masquerade with only ONE network card (NIC) 
to MASQ between internal and external Ethernet networks is NOT recommended.

<Title>How does IP Masquerade Work?</Title>


<para>
Based from the original IP Masquerade FAQ by Ken Eves:
  Here is a drawing of the most simplistic setup:
</para>

<screen>
PPP/ETH/etc.        +------------+                         +-------------+
to ISP provider     |  Linux #1  |       PPP/ETH/etc.      | Anybox      |
                    |            |                         |             |
  <---------- modem1|            |modem2 ----------- modem3|             |
                    |            |                         |             |
    111.222.121.212 |            |           192.168.0.100 |             |
                    +------------+                         +-------------+
</screen>

<para>   
In the above drawing, a Linux box with IP_MASQUERADING is installed as Linux 
#1 and is connected to the Internet via PPP, Ethernet, etc.  It has an 
assigned public IP address of 111.222.121.212.  It also has another network
interface (e.g. modem2) connected to allow incoming network traffic be it
from a PPP connection, Ethernet connection, etc.
</para>

<para>
The second system (which does not need to be Linux) connects into the 
Linux #1 box and starts its network traffic to the Internet.  This second 
machine does NOT have a publicly assigned IP address from the Internet, so it 
uses an 
<ULink URL="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt?number=1918">
RFC1918 private address</ULink>, say 192.168.0.100. (see below for more info)
</para>

<para>
 With IP Masquerade and the routing configured properly, this second machine 
"Anybox" can interact with the Internet as if it was directly connected to 
the Internet with a few small exceptions [noted later].
</para>

<para>
Quoting Pauline Middelink (the founder of Linux's IPMASQ):
</para>

<para>
"Do not forget to mention that the "ANYBOX" machine should have the Linux #1 
box configured as its default gateway (whether it be the default route or 
just a subnet is no matter). If the "ANYBOX" machine is connected via a PPP
or SLIP connection, the Linux #1 machine should be configured to support 
proxy arp for all routed addresses. But, the setup and configuration of 
proxy arp is beyond the scope of this document.  Please see the <ULink
URL="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/PPP-HOWTO/index.html">PPP-HOWTO</ULink> 
for more details."
</para>

<para>
The following is an excerpt on how IPMASQ briefly works though this will be
explained in more detail later.  This short text is based from a previous post 
on comp.os.linux.networking which has been edited to match the names used in 
the above example:
</para>

<screen>
   o I tell machine ANYBOX that my PPP or Ethernet connected Linux box is its 
     gateway.

   o When a packet comes into the Linux box from ANYBOX, it will assign the 
     packet to a new TCP/IP source port number and insert its own IP address 
     inside the packet header, saving the originals.  The MASQ server will 
     then send the modified packet over the PPP/ETH interface onto the 
     Internet.

   o When a packet returns from the Internet into the Linux box, Linux 
     examines if the port number is one of those ports that was assigned 
     above.  If so, the MASQ server will then take the original port and 
     IP address, put them back in the returned packet header, and send 
     the packet to ANYBOX.

   o The host that sent the packet will never know the difference. 
</screen>

<Emphasis >Another IP Masquerading Example:</Emphasis>
</para>

<para>
A typical example is given in the diagram below:

<para>
In this example, there are (4) computer systems that we are concerned about.   
There is also presumably something on the far right that your PPP/ETH 
connection to the Internet comes through (modem server, DSL DSLAM, Cablemodem
router, etc.).   Out on the Internet, there exists some remote host (very far 
off to the right of the page) that you are interested in communicating with).  
The Linux system named <Emphasis><Literal>Masq-Gate</Literal></Emphasis> is 
the IP Masquerading gateway for ALL internal networked machines.  In this 
example, the machines <Emphasis><Literal>A-box</Literal></Emphasis>, <Emphasis>
<Literal>B-box</Literal></Emphasis>, and <Emphasis><Literal>C-box</Literal>
</Emphasis> would have to go through the Masq-Gate to reach the Internet.  The 
internal network uses one of several 
<ULink URL="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/rfc1918.html">
RFC-1918 assigned private network addresses</ULink>, where in this case, would 
be the Class-C network 192.168.0.0.  If you aren't familiar with RFC1918, it
is encouraged to read the first few chapters of the RFC but the jist of it is
that the TCP/IP addresses 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16-31.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16 
are reserved.  When we say "reserved", we mean that anyone can use these
addresses as long as they aren't routed over the Internet.  ISPs are even
allowed to use this private addressing space as long as they keep these
addresses within their own networks and NOT advertise them to other ISPs.
Unfortunately, this isn't always the case but thats beyond the scope of
this HOWTO.
</para>

<para>
Anyway, the Linux box in the diagram above has the TCP/IP address 192.168.0.1 
while the other systems has the addresses:

The three machines, <Literal>A-box</Literal>, <Literal>B-box</Literal> and

95</Emphasis>, <Emphasis >Macintosh MacTCP or OpenTransport </Emphasis>, or 
even another <Emphasis >Linux box</Emphasis> have the ability to connect to 
other machines on the Internet.  When running the IP Masquerade, the 
masquerading system or <Literal>MASQ-gate</Literal> converts all of these 
internal connections so that they appear to originate from the 
<Literal>masq-gate</Literal> itself.  MASQ then arranges so that the data 
coming back to a masqueraded connection is relayed to the proper originating 
system.   Therefore, the systems on the internal network are only able to see 
a direct route to the internet and are unaware that their data is being 
masqueraded.  This is called a "Transparent" connection.

<Title>Requirements for IP Masquerade on Linux 2.4.x</Title>

<listitem>
<para>
The newest 2.4.x kernels are now using both a completely new TCP/IP network
stack as well as a new NAT sub-system called NetFilter.  Within this NetFilter
suite of tools, we now have a tool called IPTABLES for the 2.4.x kernels much 
like there was IPCHAINS for the 2.2.x kernels and IPFWADM for the 2.0.x kernels.
The new IPTABLES system is far more powerful (combines several functions into 
one place like true NAT functionality), offers better security (stateful 
inspection), and better performance with the new 2.4.x TCP/IP stack.  But this 
new suite of tools can be a bit complicated in comparison to older generation 
kernels.  Hopefully, if you follow along with this HOWTO carefully, setting up
IPMASQ won't be too bad.  If you find anything unclear, downright wrong, etc. 
please email David about it.
</para>

<para>
<Emphasis role="strong">Unlike</Emphasis> the migration to IPCHAINS from 
IPFWADM, the new NetFilter tool has kernel modules that can actually 
support older IPCHAINS and IPFWADM rulesets with minimal changes.  So 
re-writing your old MASQ or firewall ruleset scripts is not longer required.  
<Emphasis role="strong">BUT..</Emphasis> with the 2.4.x kernels, you cannot
use the old 2.2.x MASQ modules like ip_masq_ftp, ip_masq_irc, etc. 
<Emphasis role="strong">AND</Emphasis> IPCHAINS is incompatible with the 
new IPTABLES modules like ip_conntrack_ftp, etc.  So, what does this mean?
It basically means that if you want to use IPMASQ or PORTFW functionality under 
a 2.4.x kernel, you shouldn't use IPCHAINS rules but IPTABLES ones instead.  
Please also keep in mind that there might be several benefits in performing a 
full ruleset re-write to take advantage of the newer IPTABLES features like 
stateful tracking, etc. but that is dependant upon how much time you have to 
migrate your old rulesets.  Please see <XRef LinkEnd="ipchains-on-2.4.x"> for
additional details.

Netfilter is an entirely new architechure thus most of the older 2.2.x 
MASQ kernel modules written to make non-NAT friendly network applications
work through IPMASQ need to be re-written for the 2.4.x kernels.  Because of 
this, if you specifically need functionality from some of these modules
(see below), you should stay with a 2.2.x kernel until these modules have 
been either ported or the application has been updated to use NAT-friendly
protocols.  If you are curious on the porting status of a given module, 
please email the author of the module and NOT David or Ambrose.  We don't 
code.. we just document.  :-)

If your private network contains any vital information, think carefully in

   <listitem>
    <para>
     NOTE #1: As both the 2.4.x kernel train and the iptables program 
development progresses, the compile configurion options will change over time.  
As of this version of the IPMASQ howto, this section reflects the settings for 
IPTABLES 1.2.7a and the 2.4.20 kernel.  If you are compiling against a newer 
or previous kernel or IPTABLES version, the dialogs and even commands might 
look different.  It is recommended that you update to the newest versions of 
both the kernel and IPTABLES for added capability, performance, and stability 
of the kernel.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </Itemizedlist>
 </listitem>

 <listitem>
  <para>
   Next, depending on the version of the Linux kernel and IPTABLES archive you 
   downloaded, you <Emphasis role="strong">might </Emphasis>want to apply some 
   IPTABLES "patch-o-matic" patches against the kernel.  These OPTIONAL patches 
   might fix some known problems, add additional functionality you might need 
   (H.323 protocol, specific issues with network games), etc.  It should be 
   noted that the Patch-O-Matic patches used to come with the IPTABLES archive.
   This is no longer the case and you have to download them (if any) seperately. 
   You can find the the various URLs for downloading IPTABLES, the 
   Patch-o-matic system, etc.  <XRef LinkEnd="kernel-2.4.x-Requirements">.
  </para>
 </listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
If this is your first time compiling the kernel, don't be scared. In fact, 
it's rather easy and it's covered in several URLs found in 
<XRef LinkEnd="kernel-2.4.x-Requirements">.  Please note that the instructions
included here is just one way to do build a kernel.  Please see the Kernel
HOWTO for full details.
</para>

<para>
<Emphasis role="strong">NOTE: </Emphasis>Please notice that it <Emphasis
role="strong">IS NOT </Emphasis> recommended to put the new kernel sources 
into the /usr/src/linux directory.  You should leave the original kernel 
sources that came with your Linux distribution in /usr/src/linux.  For more 
details on this topic, please read the "README" file in the top level 
directory of the kernel sources.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>For this HOWTO example, create a directory called <Literal>/usr/src/kernel</Literal>.  
Next, "cd" into this directory and download the newest 2.4.x kernel sources
into it.  Once downloaded, issue the following command (if the file ends in a .tar.gz): 
<Literal>tar xvzf linux-2.4.x.tar.gz</Literal> or (if the file ends in a 
.tar.bzip2): <Literal>tar xyvf linux-2.4.x.tar.bz2</Literal>.  Please 
substitute the "x" in the 2.4.x filename with the Linux 2.4 kernel version you 
downloaded.  
</para>

<para>
BZ2 Note:  Some Linux distributions use the "I" option instead of the "y" 
option to decompress bzip2 archives.
</para>

  <para>
   Once uncompressed, I recommend that you rename the directory from the stock
   "linux" name to "linux-2.4.x" (replace the "x" with the specific version of
   your newly installed kernel) for clarity.  To do this, run the command 
   "<Literal>mv linux linux-2.4.x</Literal>".  Next, make sure there is a 
   directory or symbolic link pointing to 
   "<Literal>/usr/src/kernel/linux</Literal>" ie.  run the command: 
   <screen>ln -s /usr/src/kernel/linux-2.4.x /usr/src/kernel/linux</screen> 
   again subsituting the "x" for your proper kernel version.
  </para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
As mentioned above, you might consider applying any appropriate or optional 
patches to the kernel's MASQ code BEFORE you compile the final kernel.  
The IP MASQ code found in the stock kernels is already very useful and does 
not require any specific patching in order for the system to work for 
NAT-friendly network applications.  Many of these patches are only to fix 
possible known bugs, add new features (some are /very/ cool), etc.  Please 
refer to <XRef LinkEnd="kernel-2.4.x-Requirements"> for URLs and the

The pending/05_ECN-tcpchecksum-littleendian-fix patch:
   Author: Patrick McHardy 
   Status: Pending for kernel inclusion
   
   The 2.4.20 kernel included the new iptables 'ECN' target, enabling a
selective
   ECN disable mechanism.   Unfortunately there was a bug in the incremental
TCP
   checksum update, resulting in broken TCP checksums on little endian
machines.
   
   This patch fixes the Bug.

   towards the bottom of the screen.  Beyond that, you don't have to
   install anything at this point.  The next step is to compile the new 
   PATCHED kernel.
  </para>
 </listitem>


 <listitem>
  <para>
   Ok, now the new kernel is ready to be compiled but you should make sure 
   that you also have the proper matching <literal>iptables</literal> program 
   on your machine too (just to make sure).  Run the command:
   <Itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      <screen>whereis iptables</screen>
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </Itemizedlist>
   and make sure its installed on the machine (the default place is in
   <literal>/usr/local/sbin/iptables</literal>.  If you cannot find it
   or patched up your kernel sources as shown above, I recommend you just 
   re-compile it up as shown above.  
  </para>
 </listitem>
</ItemizedList>

<para>
 Now that the kernel sources are patched up, you need to configure it to
 know what kinds of features you need (HD support, Networking support, MASQ 
 support, etc.).  Here are the MINIMUM kernel configuration options required 
 to enable IP Masquerade functionality.  Please understand that this HOWTO 
 illustrates just ONE way to configure and compile a kernel (modules vs static).  
 The main difference from this example vs. an example given by a different
 MASQ guide is that some people might wish to compile kernel components either 
 as <Emphasis role="strong">modules OR monolithically</Emphasis> into the 
 kernel.  Basically, compiling things as modules gives you added flexibility 
 to what is or isn't installed into the kernel (reduces unneeded memory use 
 for things you aren't / won't use and modules also allow for drop-in software
 upgrades [usually no need to reboot the machine]).  On the flip side, kernel 
 modules add more complexity to your configuration and sometimes the kernel 
 auto-loader might make mistakes (not that I've ever seen this happen).  
 Compiling things directly into the kernel makes things simpler BUT you loose 
 a huge level of flexibility.  The following kernel configuration example is a 
 mixture of both a selection of kernel modules and building them in 
 monolithically (you probably will ALWAYS need MASQ functionality ready to go).
</para>

<ItemizedList>
 <listitem>
  <para>
   Side Note:  It is assumed that you will also configure the kernel to use your 
   other installed hardware such as USB printers, Ethernet network interfaces, 
   SCSI and IDE HD controllers, etc. as well.  Please refer to the 
   <ULink URL="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO/index.html">
   Linux Kernel HOWTO</ULink> and the kernel source's "<Literal>README</Literal>" 
   file and "<Literal>Documentation/</Literal>" directory for detailed help on 
   compiling a kernel.
  </para>
 </listitem>
</ItemizedList>

<para>
You will need to answer either <Emphasis role="strong">YES, NO, or MODULE
</Emphasis> to the following program.  Not all options will be available 
without the proper kernel patches described later in this HOWTO.  This
shouldn't be an issue as most 3rd party patches are only needed for a very 
select group of users.

    - OPTIONAL: Allows for support of advanced kernel routing messages
                if you enabled the CONFIG_NETLINK option

  * Netlink device emulation (CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV) [N/y/m/?] (NEW)  
    - NO:  This option does not have anything to do with packet firewall 
           logging

  * Network packet filtering (replaces ipchains) (CONFIG_NETFILTER) [N/y/?] y
    - YES: Enable this option to let IPTABLES configure the TCP/IP subsection

           routing mechanisms like IP Masq, packet filtering, etc.

  * Network packet filtering debugging (CONFIG_NETFILTER_DEBUG) [N/y/?] (NEW) n
    - NO: Not required for Masquerading functionality though it may help 
          for troubleshooting.  There might be a performance penalty when
          enabling this.

  * Socket Filtering (CONFIG_FILTER) [Y/n/?]
    - OPTIONAL:  Recommended : Though this doesn't have anything do with IPMASQ, 
      if you plan on implimenting a DHCP server on the internal network, you WILL 
      need to enable this option.

  * Unix domain sockets (CONFIG_UNIX) [Y/m/n/?]
    - YES:  This enables the UNIX TCP/IP sockets mechanisms

  * TCP/IP networking (CONFIG_INET) [Y/n/?]
    - YES: Enables the TCP/IP protocol

                 support Multicast as well for this all to work at all
                 
  * IP: advanced router (CONFIG_IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER) [Y/n/?]
    - OPTIONAL:  Though there is nothing in this section mandatory for 
                 Masquerade, some specific options might be useful

    == Non-MASQ options skipped 
    ==   ( autoconf, tunneling )

  * IP: multicast routing (CONFIG_IP_MROUTE) [N/y/?] n
    - OPTIONAL:  Though not needed for IPMASQ, enabling this feature will
                 let you route multicast traffic through your Linux box.
                 Please note that this requires that your ISP be multicast
                 enabled as well.

    == Non-MASQ options skipped 
    ==   (ARPd) 

  * IP: TCP Explicit Congestion Notification support (CONFIG_INET_ECN) [N/y/?] n
    - NO: Though enabling this option would be great, there are many Internet
          sites out there that will block this.  Hit the "?" when configuring
          the kernel to learn more about it but it is recommended to say NO for 
          now.

  * IP: TCP syncookie support (disabled per default) (CONFIG_SYN_COOKIES) [Y/n/?]
    - YES: Recommended : for basic TCP/IP network security

    - YES: (Module) This enables the kernel to track various network connections.
           This option is required for Masquerading support as well as to enable 
           Stateful tracking for various filewall mechanisms.  Please note that
           if you compile this directly into the kernel, you cannot enable
           the legacy IPCHAINS or IPFWADM compatibility modules.

  * FTP protocol support (CONFIG_IP_NF_FTP) [M/n/?] (NEW) m
    - YES: (Module) This enables the proper Masquerading of FTP connections if 
           CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK was enabled above

  * IRC protocol support (CONFIG_IP_NF_IRC) [M/n/?] (NEW) m
    - YES: (Module) This enables the proper Masquerading of IRC connections if 
           CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK was enabled above

  * Userspace queueing via NETLINK (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_IP_NF_QUEUE) [N/y/m/?] (NEW) m
    - OPTIONAL: Though this is OPTIONAL, this feature will allow IPTABLES to 
                copy specific packets to UserSpace tools for additional checks

  * IP tables support (required for filtering/masq/NAT) (CONFIG_IP_NF_IPTABLES) [N/y/m/?] (NEW) m
    - YES: (Module) Enables IPTABLES support

  * limit match support (CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_LIMIT) [N/y/m/?] (NEW) y
    - OPTIONAL:  (Module) Recommended : Though not required, this option can used to 
                 enable rate limiting of both traffic and loggin messages help slow down denial

  * MAC address match support (CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_MAC) [N/y/m/?] (NEW) m
    - OPTIONAL:  Though not required, the option can allow you to 
                 filter traffic based upon the SOURCE Ethernet MAC address.

  * netfilter MARK match support (CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_MARK) [N/y/m/?] (NEW) y
    - YES: (Module) Recommended : This enables IPTABLES to take action upon marked packets.  
           This mechanism can allow for PORTFW functionality, TOS marking, etc.

  * Multiple port match support (CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_MULTIPORT) [N/y/m/?] (NEW) y
    - YES: (Module) Recommended : This enables IPTABLES to accept mutliple SRC/DST port
           ranges (non-contiguous) instead of one port range per IPTABLES 
           statement.

  * TOS match support (CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TOS) [Y/m/n/?] n
    - OPTIONAL:  This allows IPTABLES to match packets based upon their
                 DIFFSERV settings.

  * LENGTH match support (CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_LENGTH) [N/m/?] (NEW) n
    - OPTIONAL:  This allows IPTABLES to match packets based upon their
                 packet length.

  * TTL match support (CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TTL) [N/m/?] (NEW) ? n
    - OPTIONAL:  This allows IPTABLES to match packets based upon their
                 TTL settings.

  * tcpmss match support (CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TCPMSS) [N/y/m/?] m
    - OPTIONAL: (Module) Recommended :  This option allows users to examine the MSS value in
                 TCP SYN packets.  This is an advanced knob but can be very valuable in 
                 troubleshooting MTU problems.

  * Connection state match support (CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_STATE) [M/n/?]  m
    - YES: (Module) Recommended : This option allows for Stateful tracking of network
            connections.

  * Unclean match support (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_UNCLEAN) [N/y/m/?] y
    - YES: (Module) Recommended :  This option allows for connection tracking on odd packets.
           It cal also help in the detection of possibly malicious packets.
            This can be a valuable tool in tracking hostile people on the network.

  * Owner match support (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_OWNER) [N/y/m/?] n
    - OPTIONAL:  This option allows IPTABLES to match traffic based upon the 
                 user login, group, etc. who created the traffic.

  * Packet filtering (CONFIG_IP_NF_FILTER) [N/y/m/?] ? y
    - YES: (Module) This option allows for the kernel to be able filter traffic at
            the INPUT, FORWARDING, and OUTPUT traffic points.

    * REJECT target support (CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_REJECT) [N/y/m/?] (NEW) y
      - YES: (Module) With this option, a packet firewall can send an ICMP Reject packet
            back to the originator when a packet is blocked.

  * MIRROR target support (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_MIRROR) [N/y/m/?] (NEW) n
    - OPTIONAL: This option allows the packet firewall to mirror the exact same 
                network packet back to the originator when it is supposed to be 
                blocked.  This is similar to the REJECT option above but it actually 
                sends the original packet back to the originator.  i.e. a
                hostile user could actually portscan themselves.


  * Full NAT (CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT) [M/n/?] m
    - YES: (Module) This option enables the future menus to enable Masquerading, 
           PORTFWing, Full (1:1) NAT, etc.


  * MASQUERADE target support (CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_MASQUERADE) [M/n/?] (NEW) m
    - YES: (Module) This option specifically enables Masquerade into the 
           kernel

  * REDIRECT target support (CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_REDIRECT) [N/y/m/?] n
    - OPTIONAL: Not needed for normal MASQ functionality though people who 
                want to do transparent proxy via Squid will want this.  

  * Basic SNMP-ALG support (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT_SNMP_BASIC) [N/m/?] n
    - OPTIONAL: This enables IPTABLES to properly NAT internal SNMP packets so 
                that machines with duplicate addressing ranges can be properly
                managed.

                
  * Packet mangling (CONFIG_IP_NF_MANGLE) [N/y/m/?] y
    - YES: (Module) This option allows for advanced IPTABLES packet manipulation 
           options.


  * TOS target support (CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_TOS) [N/y/m/?] (NEW) n
    - OPTIONAL: Enables the kernel to modify the TOS field in a packet 
           before routing it on

  * MARK target support (CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_MARK) [N/y/m/?] (NEW) m
    - OPTIONAL: (Module) Recommended : This enables the kernel to manipulate 
                packets based upon the MARK field.  This can be used for PORTFW 
                as well as many other things.

  * LOG target support (CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_LOG) [N/y/m/?]  m
    - YES: (Module)  This allows for the logging of packets before they are accepted,
           denied, rejected, etc.

  * TCPMSS target support (CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_TCPMSS) [N/y/m/?] ? m
    - YES: (Module) This option help some people with MTU problems.  Typically,
           most users have to set their Internet connection's MTU to 
           1500 as well as ALL internal machines to 1500.  With this
           option, this whole MTU issue might be finally solved.

  * ipchains (2.2-style) support (CONFIG_IP_NF_COMPAT_IPCHAINS) [N/y/m/?] m
    - OPTIONAL: (Module) Recommended : If you have an existing IPCHAINS ruleset 
           (2.2.x kernels) and enable this option, you can continue to use the 
           IPCHAINS program and the majority of your old ruleset except for the 
           use of any 2.2.x kernel-specific modules.  Please note that if this
           IPCHAINS module is loaded, ALL IPTABLES modules will be non-
           operational.  This is an either/or deal only intended for legacy
           rulesets.

  * ipfwadm (2.0-style) support (CONFIG_IP_NF_COMPAT_IPFWADM) [N/y/m/?] n
    - OPTIONAL: If you have an existing IPFWADM ruleset (2.0.x kernels) and 
           enable this option, you can continue to use the IPFWADM program and 
           the majority of your old ruleset except for the use of any 2.0.x 
           kernel-specific modules.   Please note that if this IPFWADM module 
           is loaded, ALL IPTABLES modules will be non operational.  This is 
           an either/or deal only intended to support legacy rulesets.                 


    == Non-MASQ options skipped
    ==   (IPv6, khttpd, ATM, IPX, AppleTalk, etc.) --

  * Fast switching (read help!) (CONFIG_NET_FASTROUTE) [N/y/?] n
    - NO: This performance optimization is NOT compatible with IP MASQ and/or
          packet filtering


    == Non-MASQ options skipped
    == (QoS, Telephony, IDE, SCSI, 1394FW, I2O, etc)

      == Don't forget to compile in support for hardware that you might need:
      ==   IDE:    HDs, CDROMs, etc.
      ==   SCSI:   HDs, CDROMs, etc.


[ Network device support ]

  * Network device support (CONFIG_NETDEVICES) [Y/n/?]
    - YES: Enables the Linux Network device sublayer 

    == Non-MASQ options skipped
    ==   (Arcnet) 


  * Dummy net driver support (CONFIG_DUMMY) [M/n/y/?]

   Now that the kernel is patched up (if required), here are the MINIMUM kernel

   understand that this HOWTO illustrates just ONE way to compile a kernel. The
   main difference from this method vs. a different one is some people wish to
   compile things either as modules OR monolithically right into the kernel.
   Basically, compiling things as modules gives you added flexibility to what is
   or isn't installed into the kernel (reduces unneeded memory use and allow for
   drop-in upgrades [no need to reboot]) BUT they add more complexity to your
   configuration. On the flip side, compiling things directly into the kernel
   makes things simpler BUT you loose a level of flexibility. The following
   example is a mixture of both built-in AND modules.

</para>

<para>
<Screen>
[ Code maturity level options ]

  * Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers (CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL) [Y/n/?]
    - YES: though not entirely required for IP MASQ, this option allows the kernel 
           to create possible additional MASQ modules such as PORTFW, etc.

  == Non-MASQ options skipped
  ==   (CPU, memory, MTRR, SMP, etc.)


[ Loadable module support ]

  * Enable loadable module support (CONFIG_MODULES) [Y/n/?] y
    - YES: allows you to load kernel IP MASQ modules

  * Set version information on all symbols for modules (CONFIG_MODVERSIONS) [N/y/?] y
    - YES: allows newer kernels to load older modules if possible

  * Kernel module loader (CONFIG_KMOD) [Y/n/?] y
    - OPTIONAL: Recommended : allows the kernel to load various kernel modules as 
         it needs them


[ General setup ]

  * Networking support (CONFIG_NET) [Y/n/?]
    - YES: This enables the network subsystem

  == Non-MASQ options skipped
  ==   (PCI, kernel binaries, specific hardware options, etc.)


  * Sysctl support (CONFIG_SYSCTL) [Y/n/?] 
    - YES:  Enables the ability to enable disable options such as forwarding,
      dynamic IPs, etc. via the /proc interface


[ Block devices ]

  == Non-MASQ options skipped
  ==   (kernel binaries, power management, PnP, IDE, SCSI, etc.)

    == Don't forget to compile in support for hardware that you might need:
    ==   IDE controllers, HDs, CDROMs, etc.


[ Networking options ]


  * Packet socket (CONFIG_PACKET) [Y/m/n/?] y
    - YES: Though this is OPTIONAL, this recommended feature will allow you 
           to use TCPDUMP to debug any problems with IP MASQ

  * Kernel/User netlink socket (CONFIG_NETLINK) [Y/n/?] y
    - OPTIONAL: Recommended :  This feature will allow the logging of 
           advanced firewall issues such as routing messages, etc

  * Routing messages (CONFIG_RTNETLINK) [Y/n/?] y
    - OPTIONAL: If you enabled the CONFIG_NETLINK option above, this option 
           will send routing messages and other information to SYSLOG.

  * Netlink device emulation (CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV) [N/y/m/?] (NEW) n
    - NO:  This option does not have anything to do with packet firewall 
           logging

  * Network firewalls (CONFIG_FIREWALL) [Y/n/?] y
    - YES: Enables the kernel to be comfigured by the IPCHAINS firewall tool

  * Socket Filtering (CONFIG_FILTER) [Y/n/?] y
    - OPTIONAL:  Though this doesn't have anything do with IPMASQ, if you 
         plan on implimenting a DHCP server on the internal network, you 
         WILL need this option.

  * Unix domain sockets (CONFIG_UNIX) [Y/m/n/?] y
    - YES:  This enables the UNIX TCP/IP sockets mechanisms

  * TCP/IP networking (CONFIG_INET) [Y/n/?] y
    - YES: Enables the TCP/IP protocol

  * IP: multicasting (CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST) [N/y/?] y
    - OPTIONAL:  You can enable this if you want to be able to receive
                 Multicast traffic.  Please note that your ISP must 
                 support Multicast as well for this all to work
                 
  * IP: advanced router (CONFIG_IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER) [Y/n/?] n
    - OPTIONAL:  Though there is nothing in this section mandatory for 
                 Masquerade, some specific options might be useful

  * IP: kernel level autoconfiguration (CONFIG_IP_PNP) [N/y/?] ?
    - NO:  Not needed for normal MASQ functionality

  * IP: firewalling (CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL) [Y/n/?] y
    - YES: This enables the kernel to support packet filtering, NAT, etc.

  * IP: firewall packet netlink device (CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL_NETLINK) [Y/n/?] n
    - OPTIONAL: Though this is OPTIONAL, this feature will allow IPCHAINS to 
                copy some packets to UserSpace tools for additional checks

  * IP: transparent proxy support (CONFIG_IP_TRANSPARENT_PROXY) [N/y/?] n
    - OPTIONAL:  Not needed for normal MASQ functionality though people who 
           want to do transparent proxy via Squid will want this.  Please note
           that there is a PERFORMANCE PENALTY enabling this feature.

  * IP: masquerading (CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE) [Y/n/?] y
    - YES: Enable IP Masquerade to re-address specific internal to external 
           TCP/IP packets

  * IP: ICMP masquerading (CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_ICMP) [Y/n/?] y
    - YES: Enable support for masquerading ICMP ping packets (ICMP error 
           codes will be MASQed regardless).  This is an important feature 
           for troubleshooting connections.

  * IP: masquerading special modules support (CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_MOD) [Y/n/?] y
    - YES: Though OPTIONAL, this enables the option to later enable other
           modules like the PORTFW to give external computers a directly 
           connection to specified internal MASQed machines.

  * IP: ipautofw masq support (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_IPAUTOFW) [N/y/m/?] n
    - NO:  NOT recommended : IPautofw is a legacy method of port forwarding.  It 
           is mainly old code and has been found to have some issues.  

  * IP: ipportfw masq support (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_IPPORTFW) [Y/m/n/?] y
    - OPTIONAL: Recommended : This enables PORTFW which allows external computers 
           on the Internet to directly communicate to specified internal MASQed 
           machines.  This feature is typically used to allow access to internal 
           SMTP, TELNET, and WWW servers.  Please note that FTP port forwarding 
           needs an additional patch, as described in the FAQ section of the MASQ 
           HOWTO.  Please see the this FAQ section in the HOWTO for additional 
           information.

  * IP: ip fwmark masq-forwarding support (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_MFW) [Y/m/n/?] y
    - OPTIONAL:  This is a NEW method of performing PORTFW-like functionality which is
           similar to how the new 2.4.x kernels do things.  With this option, IPCHAINS 
           can mark packets that should have additional work done upon it.  Using a 
           UserSpace tool, much like IPMASQADM or IPPORFW, IPCHAINS would then 
           do things like re-address the packets, change their TOS value, etc. 
           Currently, this code is less tested than PORTFW but it looks promising.  
           For now, this HOWTO recommends to use IPMASQADM and IPPORTFW.  If you 
           have specific thoughts or comments on MFW, please email dranch.

  * IP: optimize as a router not host (CONFIG_IP_ROUTER) [Y/n/?] y
    - YES:  This optimizes the kernel for the network subsystem, though it 
            isn't well known if this makes a siginificant performance difference 
            or not.

  == Non-MASQ options skipped 
  ==   ( autoconf, tunneling, GRE )


  * IP: multicast routing (CONFIG_IP_MROUTE) [N/y/?] n
    - OPTIONAL:  Though not needed for IPMASQ, enabling this feature will
                 let you route multicast traffic through your Linux box.
                 Please note that this requires that your ISP be multicast
                 enabled as well.


    == Non-MASQ options skipped 
    ==  (Aliasing, ARPd) 

  * IP: TCP syncookie support (disabled per default) (CONFIG_SYN_COOKIES) [Y/n/?]
    - YES: Recommended : for basic TCP/IP network security

  * IP: GRE tunnels over IP (CONFIG_NET_IPGRE) [N/y/m/?]
    - NO:   This OPTIONAL selection is to enable PPTP and GRE tunnels through 
            the IP MASQ box

    == Non-MASQ options skipped
    ==   (aliasing, ARPd) 


  * IP: TCP syncookie support (not enabled per default) (CONFIG_SYN_COOKIES) [Y/n/?]
    - YES: HIGHLY recommended for basic TCP/IP network security

    == Non-MASQ options skipped
    ==  (RARP)


  * IP: Allow large windows (not recommended if <16Mb of memory) * (CONFIG_SKB_LARGE) [Y/n/?]
    - YES:  This is recommended to optimize Linux's TCP window 

    == Non-MASQ options skipped
    ==   (IPv6, IPX, WAN router, etc.)

  * Fast switching (read help!) (CONFIG_NET_FASTROUTE) [N/y/?] n
    - NO: This performance optimization is NOT compatible with IP MASQ and/or
          packet filtering


  == Non-MASQ options skipped
  == (Slow CPU, Telephony, SCSI, I2O, etc. )

    == Don't forget to compile in support for hardware that you might need:
    ==   SCSI:   HDs, CDROMs, etc.


[ Network device support ]

  * Network device support (CONFIG_NETDEVICES) [Y/n/?]
    - YES: Enables the Linux Network device sublayer 


  == Non-MASQ options skipped
  ==   (Arcnet) 


  * Dummy net driver support (CONFIG_DUMMY) [M/n/y/?] 
    - YES:  Though OPTIONAL, this option can help when debugging problems


  == Non-MASQ options skipped
  == (EQL, NICs, Wireless, IrDA, ISDN, etc..)

    == Don't forget to compile in support for hardware that you might need:
    ==   NICs:   eth, tr, etc.
    ==   MODEMs: ppp and/or slip
    ==   WANs:   T1, T3, ISDN, etc.
    ==   ISDN:   for internal ISDN modems


 [ Character devices ]

  == Don't forget to compile in serial port support for modem users
  == Don't forget to compile in mouse support


  == Non-MASQ options skipped
  ==   (I2C, Watchdog cards, Ftape, Video for Linux, USB, etc. )


[ File systems ]

  == Non-MASQ options skipped
  ==   (Quota, ISO9660, NTFS, etc )


  * /proc filesystem support (CONFIG_PROC_FS) [Y/n/?]
    - YES:  Required to dynamically configure the Linux forwarding 
            and NATing systems


  == Non-MASQ options skipped
  ==   (network fs, NLS, video section, sound, kernel hacking)

           Though IPautofw works, IPPORTFW is a better choice.


  * IP: ipportfw masq support (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_IPPORTFW) [Y/n/?] y
    - YES: This option is ONLY AVAILABLE VIA A PATCH for the 2.0.x kernels.  
           With this option, external computers on the Internet can directly 
           communicate to specified internal MASQed machines.  This feature is 
           typically used to access internal SMTP, TELNET, and WWW servers.  
           FTP port forwarding sometimes might require an additional patch as 
           described in the FAQ section.  Additional information on port 
           forwarding is available in the Forwards section of this HOWTO.


  * IP: MS PPTP masq support (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_PPTP) [N/y/?] (NEW) n
    - OPTIONAL: Enabling this feature will allow internal MASQ clients to
          properly connect to PPTP servers on the Internet.

  * IP: MS PPTP Call ID masq support (CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_PPTP_MULTICLIENT) [N/y/?] (NEW) n

    - OPTIONAL:  NOT recommended : This is not required for IP MASQ or MASQing PPTP 
           connections unless you need additional troubleshooting help.  If enabled, 
           this can fill up your logs quickly.

  * IP: MS PPTP masq verbose debugging (DEBUG_IP_MASQUERADE_PPTP_VERBOSE) [N/y/?] (NEW) n
    - OPTIONAL: NOT Recommended : If you enabled the DEBUG_IP_MASQUERADE_PPTP
           option above, this will make the logging even more verbose.

  * IP: IPSEC ESP & ISAKMP masq support (EXPERIMENTAL) * (CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_IPSEC) [N/y/?] m
    - OPTIONAL: This option allows for some forms of IPSEC tunnels to be
           masquraded

  * IP: IPSEC masq table lifetime (minutes) (CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_IPSEC_EXPIRE) * [30] (NEW) 
    - OPTIONAL: This feature allows to change the MASQ table timeouts so that
      idle IPSEC tunnels won't be prematurely disconnected.

  * IP: Disable inbound ESP destination guessing * (CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_IPSEC_NOGUESS) [N/y/?] n
    - OPTIONAL: This feature allows the kernel to guess where the fully encrypted IPSEC VPN 
           might be going and add it to the MASQ table.

  * IP: IPSEC masq debugging (DEBUG_IP_MASQUERADE_IPSEC) [N/y/?] ? n
    - OPTIONAL:  NOT recommended : This is not required for IP MASQ or MASQing IPSEC 
           connections unless you need additional troubleshooting help.  If enabled, 
           this can fill up your logs quickly.

    - OPTIONAL: NOT Recommended : If you enabled the DEBUG_IP_MASQUERADE_IPSEC
           option above, this will make the logging even more verbose.


  * IP: ICMP masquerading (CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_ICMP) [Y/n/?]
    - YES: Enable support for masquerading ICMP packets. Though thought of as 
           optional, many programs will NOT function properly with out ICMP 
           support.

  * IP: transparent proxy support (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_IP_TRANSPARENT_PROXY) [N/y/?] n
    - OPTIONAL:  Not needed for normal MASQ functionality though people who 
           want to do transparent proxy via Squid will want this.  Please note
           that there is a PERFORMANCE PENALTY enabling this feature.

  * IP: loose UDP port managing (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_IP_MASQ_LOOSE_UDP) [Y/n/?] 
    - YES: This option is ONLY AVAILABLE VIA A PATCH for the 2.0.x kernels.
           With this option, internally masqueraded computers can play

<Title>Assigning Private Network IP Addresses to the Internal LAN</Title>

<para>
Since all <Emphasis role="strong">INTERNAL MASQed</Emphasis> machines should 
NOT have official Internet assigned addressees, there must be a specific and 
accepted way to allocate addresses to those machines without conflicting with 
anyone else's Internet address. 
</para>

<para>
From the original IP Masquerade FAQ:
</para>

<para>
<ULink URL="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/INDEX.rfc.html">RFC 
1918</ULink> is the official document on which IP addresses are to be used in 
a non-connected or "private" network.  There are 3 blocks of numbers set aside 
specifically for this purpose.
</para>

<para>
<Screen>
Section 3: Private Address Space

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved the
following three blocks of the IP address space for private networks:

              10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255
              172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255
              192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255

We will refer to the first block as "24-bit block", the second as "20-bit 
block", and the third as "16-bit" block".  Note that the first block is 
nothing but a single class A network number, while the second block is a set 
of 16 continuous class B network numbers, and the third block is a set of 255 
continuous class C network numbers.
</Screen>
</para>

<para>
For the record, my preference is to use the 192.168.0.0 network with a 
255.255.255.0 Class-C subnet mask and thus this HOWTO reflects this.  Any of 
the above private networks are valid, but just be SURE to use the correct 
subnet-mask.
</para>

<para>
So, if you're using a Class-C network, you should number your TCP/IP enabled 
machines as 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.2, 192.168.0.3, .., 192.168.0.x 
</para>

<para>
192.168.0.1 is usually set as the internal gateway or Linux MASQ machine which 
reaches the external network.  Please note that 192.168.0.0 and 192.168.0.255 
are the Network and Broadcast address respectively (these addresses are 
RESERVED). Avoid using these addresses on your machines or your network will 
not function properly.

<para>
Please note that IPCHAINS is <Emphasis role="strong">no longer the primary

#Setting the EXTERNAL and INTERNAL interfaces for the network
#
#  Each IP Masquerade network needs to have at least one
#  external and one internal network.  The external network
#  is where the natting will occur and the internal network
#  should preferably be addressed with a RFC1918 private address
#  scheme.
#
#  For this example, "eth0" is external and "eth1" is internal"

#            connecting to the Internet on external interface "eth0".  This
#            example will MASQ internal traffic out to the Internet but not
#            allow non-initiated traffic into your internal network.

# The location of the ipchains and kernel module programs
#
#   If your Linux distribution came with a copy of ipchains,

#Setting the EXTERNAL and INTERNAL interfaces for the network
#
#  Each IP Masquerade network needs to have at least one
#  external and one internal network.  The external network
#  is where the NATing will occur and the internal network
#  should preferably be addressed with a RFC1918 private addressing
#  scheme.
#
#  For this example, "eth0" is external and "eth1" is internal"
#
#  NOTE:  If this doesnt EXACTLY fit your configuration, you must
#         change the EXTIF or INTIF variables above. For example:
#
#            If you are a PPPoE or analog modem user:
#
#               EXTIF="ppp0" 
#
#  ** Please change this to reflect your specific configuration **

INTIF="eth1"

# Network Address of the Internal Network
#
#   This example rc.firewall file uses the 192.168.0.0 network
#   with a /24 or 255.255.255.0 netmask.

<Title>Configuring IP Masquerade on Linux 2.0.x Kernels</Title>

<para>
Create the file /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall with the following initial SIMPLE 
ruleset:

&lt;rc.firewall-ipfwadm START&gt;
<Screen>
#!/bin/sh
#
# rc.firewall-ipfwadm
#
#  A Initial SIMPLE IP Masquerade setup for 2.0.x kernels using IPFWADM
#
FWVER="2.03"
# 
# 2.03 - Added comments on why the default policy is ACCEPT
# 2.02 - Added clarification that PPPoE users need to use
#        "ppp0" instead of "eth0" for their external interface
#
#
#        Once IP Masquerading has been tested, with this simple 
#        ruleset, it is highly recommended to use a stronger 
#        IPTABLES ruleset either given later in this HOWTO or 
#        from another reputable resource.
#
echo -e "\n\nLoading simple rc.firewall version $FWVER..\n"


#Setting the EXTERNAL and INTERNAL interfaces for the network
#
#  Each IP Masquerade network needs to have at least one
#  external and one internal network.  The external network
#  is where the NATing will occur and the internal network
#  should preferably be addressed with a RFC1918 private addressing
#  scheme.
#
#  For this example, "eth0" is external and "eth1" is internal"
#
#  NOTE:  If this doesnt EXACTLY fit your configuration, you must
#         change the EXTIF or INTIF variables above. For example:
#
#            If you are a PPPoE or analog modem user:
#
#               EXTIF="ppp0" 
#
#  ** Please change this to reflect your specific configuration **
#
EXTIF="eth0"
INTIF="eth1"
echo "   External Interface:  $EXTIF"
echo "   Internal Interface:  $INTIF"


# Network Address of the Internal Network
#
#   This example rc.firewall file uses the 192.168.0.0 network
#   with a /24 or 255.255.255.0 netmask.
#
#    ** Change this variable to reflect your specific setup **
#
INTLAN="192.168.0.0/24"
echo -e "   Internal Interface:  $INTLAN\n"

<para>
Now that the firewall ruleset is ready to go, you need to let it run after 
every reboot.  You could either do this by running it by hand everytime (such 
a pain) or add it to the boot scripts.  We have covered two methods below:

<para>
There are two ways to automatically load things in Redhat:  /etc/rc.d/rc.local 
or a init script in /etc/rc.d/init.d/.  The first method is the easiest.  All 
you have to do is add the line:
</para>

<para>

echo "Loading the rc.firewall ruleset.." 

/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall
</screen>
</para>

<para>
The problem with this approach is that the firewall isn't executed until 
the last stages of booting.  The preferred approach is to have the firewall 
loaded just after the networking subsystem is loaded.  To do this, 
copy the following file into the /etc/rc.d/init.d directory:

With this script in place, all you need to do now is make it executable and
then make it load upon reboot.  First, make it executable by running:
<screen>
#Redhat-style
#
chmod 700 /etc/rc.d/init.d/firewall-ipfwadm
</screen>
Now, make the ruleset load upon reboot:
<screen>
#Redhat style
#
chkconfig --level=345 firewall-ipfwadm on
</screen>
That's it!  Now upon boot, the firewall will be loaded automatically.  Just 
to make sure, run the command to see that the firewall should start upon
reboot by running the command:
<screen>
#Redhat style
#
chkconfig --list firewall-ipfwadm

#The output should look like:

to the end of the /etc/rc.d/rc.local file and thats it. The problem with this 
approach is that if you are running a STRONG firewall ruleset, the firewall 
isn' t executed until the last stages of booting.  The preferred approach is 
to have the firewall loaded just after the networking subsystem is loaded.  
For now, the HOWTO only covers how to do so using  /etc/rc.d/rc.local.  If you

<Title>Configuring the other internal to-be MASQed machines </Title>

<para>
Besides setting the appropriate IP address for each internal MASQed machine
(either statically or though DHCP), you should also set each internal machine 
with the appropriate gateway IP address of the Linux MASQ server and required 
DNS servers. In general, this is rather straight forward. You simply enter the 
address of your Linux host (192.168.0.1 is used throughout this HOWTO) as the 
machine's gateway address. 
</para>

<para>
For the Domain Name Service (DNS), you add in any DNS servers that are 
available to you to use. The most apparent one(s) should be the DNS servers 
that your Linux server uses. You can optionally add any "domain search" suffix 
as well for quicker connections, etc. 
</para>

<para>
After you have properly reconfigured the internal MASQed machines, remember to 
restart their appropriate network services or reboot them if need be. 
</para>

<para>
The following configuration instructions assume that you are using a Class C 
network with 192.168.0.1 as your Linux MASQ server's address. Please note that 
192.168.0.0 and 192.168.0.255 are reserved TCP/IP address per RFC1918 for uses
just like enabling IP Masquerade services.

Finally, it's time to give IP Masquerading an official try after all this hard 
work.  If you haven't already rebooted your Linux box, do so to make sure the 
machines boots ok, executes the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset, etc. Next, make 
sure that both the internal LAN connection and connection of your Linux hosts 
to the Internet is okay.

If the ping failed, check the network connection between the MASQ server and 
the PC.  If it's a DIRECT Ethernet connection (no hub or switch), you MUST 
have a "Ethernet cross-over cable".  These cables are common and can be
found at any computer store.  Without this cable, the NICs (network cards) 
will not give you a "LINK" light.  If you are using a hub or switch, make 
sure the ports connected to the MASQ server and MASQed client machine have a 
LINK light.  If they do and the pings STILL don't work or there is a lot of
packet loss, try different ports on the hub/switch (it not all that uncommon 
to have hub/switch ports die).  Finally, if things still don't work perfectly, 
try replacing each of the NICs in the machines.  You would be surprised how
many people I've helped have found that their NIC cards were going bad and
caused them all kinds of grief.

From the MASQ server, ping the external IP address of the MASQ server's 
EXTERNAL network interface that is connected to the Internet.  This address 
might be a Ethernet interface, a PPP interface, etc. connection to your ISP.  
If you don't know what this external IP address is, run the Linux command 
<Emphasis role="strong">"/sbin/ifconfig"</Emphasis> on the MASQ server itself 
to get the Internet address.  The output should look something like the 
following (we are looking for the IP address of eth0):

this example.  So, now that you have your IP address after running the

If this didn't work, again check your Internet connection.  Make sure that
the MASQ server itself can ping this address.  If this works from the MASQ 
server, make sure you are using the simple rc.firewall ruleset and that 
you have ICMP Masqurading compiled into the Linux kernel.

It might take a few seconds to get a login prompt since this is a VERY busy

Some TCP/IP application protocols will not currently work with Linux IP 
Masquerading because they either assume things about port numbers or encode 
TCP/IP addresses and/or port numbers in their data stream. These latter 
protocols need specific proxies or IP MASQ modules built into the 
masquerading code to make them work.

<Title>Incoming services </Title>

<para>
By default, Linux IP Masquerading cannot handle incoming services at all but 
there are a few ways that would allow this.
</para>

<para>
If you do not require high levels of security, then you can simply forward or 
redirect IP ports.  There are various ways to perform this, though the most 
stable method is to use IPPORTFW.  For more information, please see 
<XRef LinkEnd="Forwarders">. 
</para>

<para>
If you wish to have some level of authorization on incoming connections, then 
you will need to either configure TCP-wrappers or Xinetd to allow only 
specific IP addresses to pass.  The TIS Firewall Toolkit is a good place to 
look for tools and information.

#           with the rest of the IPMASQ howto
#   0.83s - Added additional comments to make PORTFW configs more obvious
#   0.82s - Added a special ICMP filter to work around a Netfilter security
#           issue
#         - renamed the drop-and-log-it rule to reject-and-log-it
#   0.81s - Added an additional comment in the INPUT section for NOT

# The location of various iptables and other shell programs
#
#   If your Linux distribution came with a copy of iptables, most
#   likely it is located in /sbin.  If you manually compiled 
#   iptables, the default location is in /usr/local/sbin
#
# ** Please use the "whereis iptables" command to figure out 
# ** where your copy is and change the path below to reflect 
# ** your setup
#
#IPTABLES=/sbin/iptables
IPTABLES=/usr/local/sbin/iptables

DEPMOD=/sbin/depmod
MODPROBE=/sbin/modprobe
GREP=/bin/grep
AWK=/bin/awk

#Setting the EXTERNAL and INTERNAL interfaces for the network
#
#  Each IP Masquerade network needs to have at least one
#  external and one internal network.  The external network
#  is where the natting will occur and the internal network
#  should preferably be addressed with a RFC1918 private address
#  scheme.
#
#  For this example, "eth0" is external and "eth1" is internal"
#
#  NOTE:  If this doesnt EXACTLY fit your configuration, you must 
#         change the EXTIF or INTIF variables above. For example: 
#
#            If you are a PPPoE or analog modem user:
#
#               EXTIF="ppp0" 
#
EXTIF="eth0"
INTIF="eth1"
echo "  External Interface:  $EXTIF"
echo "  Internal Interface:  $INTIF"
echo "  ---"

# Specify your Static IP address here or let the script take care of it 
# for you.
#
#   If you prefer to use STATIC addresses in your firewalls, un-# out the
#   static example below and # out the dynamic line.  If you don't care,
#   just leave this section alone.
#
#   If you have a DYNAMIC IP address, the ruleset already takes care of
#   this for you.  Please note that the different single and double quote 
#   characters and the script MATTER.
#
#
#   DHCP users:
#   -----------
#   If you get your TCP/IP address via DHCP, **you will need ** to enable the 
#   #ed out command below underneath the PPP section AND replace the word 
#   "eth0" with the name of your EXTERNAL Internet connection (ppp0, ippp0, 
#   etc) on the lines for "ppp-ip" and "extip".  You should also note that the 
#   DHCP server can and will change IP addresses on you.  To deal with this, 
#   users should configure their DHCP client to re-run the rc.firewall ruleset 
#   everytime the DHCP lease is renewed.
#
#     NOTE #1:  Some DHCP clients like the original "pump" (the newer
#               versions have been fixed) did NOT have the ability to run 
#               scripts after a lease-renew.  Because of this, you need to 
#               replace it with something like "dhcpcd" or "dhclient".
#
#     NOTE #2:  The syntax for "dhcpcd" has changed in recent versions.
#
#               Older versions used syntax like:
#                         dhcpcd -c /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall eth0
#
#               Newer versions execute a file called /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd-eth0.exe
#
#     NOTE #3:  For Pump users, put the following line in /etc/pump.conf:
#
#                   script /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall
#
#   PPP users:
#   ----------
#   If you aren't already aware, the /etc/ppp/ip-up script is always run when 
#   a PPP connection comes up.  Because of this, we can make the ruleset go and 
#   get the new PPP IP address and update the strong firewall ruleset.
#
#   If the /etc/ppp/ip-up file already exists, you should edit it and add a line
#   containing "/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall" near the end of the file.
#
#   If you don't already have a /etc/ppp/ip-up sccript, you need to create the 
#   following link to run the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall script.
#
#       ln -s /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall /etc/ppp/ip-up
#
#   * You then want to enable the #ed out shell command below *
#
#
# Determine the external IP automatically:
# ----------------------------------------
#
#  The following line will determine your external IP address.  This
#  line is somewhat complex and confusing but it will also work for
#  all NON-English Linux distributions:
#
EXTIP="`$IFCONFIG $EXTIF | $AWK \
 /$EXTIF/'{next}//{split($0,a,":");split(a[2],a," ");print a[1];exit}'`"


# For users who wish to use STATIC IP addresses:
#
#  # out the EXTIP line above and un-# out the EXTIP line below
#
#EXTIP="your.static.PPP.address"
echo "  External IP: $EXTIP"
echo "  ---"


# Assign the internal TCP/IP network and IP address

#
#    ipt_mark       - this target marks a given packet for future action.
#                     This automatically loads the ipt_MARK module
#
#    ipt_tcpmss     - this target allows to manipulate the TCP MSS
#                     option for braindead remote firewalls.
#                     This automatically loads the ipt_TCPMSS module
#

#                     to many hits per sec/min/hr
#
#    ipt_multiport  - this match allows for targets within a range
#                     of port numbers vs. listing each port individually
#
#    ipt_state      - this match allows to catch packets with various

#
#   DHCP users:

#   DHCP server can change IP addresses on you.  To fix this, users should 
#   configure their DHCP client to re-run the firewall ruleset everytime the 
#   DHCP lease is renewed.
#
#     NOTE #1:  Some DHCP clients like the original "pump" (the newer
#               versions have been fixed) did NOT have the ability to run 
#               scripts after a lease-renew.  Because of this, you need to 
#               replace it with something like "dhcpcd" or "dhclient".
#
#     NOTE #2:  The syntax for "dhcpcd" has changed in recent versions.
#
#               Older versions used syntax like:
#                         dhcpcd -c /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall eth0
#
#               Newer versions use syntax like:
#                         dhcpcd eth0 /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall
#
#     NOTE #3:  For Pump users, put the following line in /etc/pump.conf:
#
#                   script /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall
#
#   PPP users:
#   ----------
#   If you aren't already aware, the /etc/ppp/ip-up script is always run when 
#   a PPP connection comes up.  Because of this, we can make the ruleset go and 
#   get the new PPP IP address and update the strong firewall ruleset.
#
#   If the /etc/ppp/ip-up file already exists, you should edit it and add a line
#   containing "/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall" near the end of the file.
#
#   If you don't already have a /etc/ppp/ip-up sccript, you need to create the 
#   following link to run the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall script.
#
#       ln -s /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall /etc/ppp/ip-up

</para>


<para>
With IPCHAINS, you can block traffic to a particular site using the "input", 
"output", and/or "forward" rules.  Remember that the set of rules are scanned 
from top to bottom and "-A" tells IPCHIANS to "append" this new rule to the 
existing set of rules.  So with this in mind, any specific restrictions need 
to come before any global rules. For example:
</para>

<para>
Using "input" rules:  
</para>

<para>
Probably the fastest and most efficient method to block traffic, but this 
method only stops the MASQed machines and NOT the firewall machine itself. 
Of course, you might want to allow that combination.
</para>

<para>
Anyway, to block 204.50.10.13:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
In the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset:
... start of "input" rules ...

# reject and log local interface, local machines going to 204.50.10.13
#
ipchains -A input -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d 204.50.10.13/32 -l -j REJECT


# local interface, local machines, going anywhere is valid
#
ipchains -A input -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d 0.0.0.0/0 -l -j ACCEPT


... end of "input" rules ...
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Using "output" rules:  
</para>

<para>
This is the slower method to block traffic because the packets must go through 
masquerading before they are dropped.  Yet, this rule even stops the firewall 
machine from accessing the forbidden site.
</para>

<para>
... start of "output" rules ...

# reject and log outgoing to 204.50.10.13
#
ipchains -A output -s $ppp_ip/32 -d 204.50.10.13/32 -l -j REJECT


# anything else outgoing on remote interface is valid
#
ipchains -A output -s $ppp_ip/32 -d 0.0.0.0/0 -l -j ACCEPT


... end of "output" rules ...
</para>

<para>
Using "forward" rules:  
</para>

<para>
Probably slower than "input" rules for blocking traffic, this only stops 
masqueraded machines (e.g. internal machines).  The firewall machine can still 
reach forbidden site(s).
</para>

<para>
... start of "forward" rules ...

# Reject and log from local net on PPP interface to 204.50.10.13.
#
ipchains -A forward -i ppp0 -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d 204.50.10.13/32 -l -j REJECT


# Masquerade from local net on local interface to anywhere.
#
ipchains -A forward -i ppp0 -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d 0.0.0.0/0 -j MASQ

... end of "forward" rules ...
</para>

<para>
No need for a special rule to allow machines on the 192.168.0.0/24 network to 
go to 204.50.11.0. Why?  It is already covered by the global MASQ rule.
</para>

<para>
NOTE: Unlike IPFWADM, IPCHIANS has only one way of coding the interfaces name.  
IPCHAINS uses the "-i eth0" option where as IPFWADM had both "-W" for the 
interface name and "-V" for the interface's IP address.
</para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2 id="rc.firewall-ipfwadm-stronger">
<Title>Stronger IP Firewall (IPFWADM) Rulesets</Title>

<para>
This section provides a more in-depth guide on using the 2.0.x firewall tool, 
IPFWADM.  See below for IPCHAINS rulesets
</para>

<para>
This example is for a firewall/masquerade system behind a PPP link with a 
static PPP address (dynamic PPP instructions are included but disabled).  
The trusted interface is 192.168.0.1 and the PPP interface IP address has 
been changed to protect the guilty :).  I have listed each incoming and 
outgoing interface individually to catch IP spoofing as well as stuffed 
routing and/or masquerading. Anything not explicitly allowed is 
<Emphasis role="strong">FORBIDDEN</Emphasis> (well.. rejected, actually).  
If your IP MASQ box breaks after implementing this rc.firewall script, be sure 
that you edit it for your configuration and check your /var/log/messages or 
/var/adm/messages SYSLOG file for any firewall errors.

<para>
With IPFWADM, you can block traffic to a particular site using the -I, -O or -F 
rules.  Remember that the set of rules are scanned top to bottom and "-a" tells 
IPFWADM to "append" this new rule to the existing set of rules.  So with this in 
mind, any specific restrictions need to come before global rules. For example:
</para>

<para>
Using -I (input ) rules:
</para>

<para>
Probably the fastest and most efficient method to block traffic but it only 
stops the MASQed machines, and NOT the the firewall machine itself. Of course, 
you might want to allow that combination.
</para>

Anyway, to block 204.50.10.13:
</para>

<para>
In the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset:
... start of -I rules ...

# reject and log local interface, local machines going to 204.50.10.13
#
/sbin/ipfwadm -I -a reject -V 192.168.0.1 -S 192.168.0.0/24 -D 204.50.10.13/32 -o

# local interface, local machines, going anywhere is valid

/sbin/ipfwadm -I -a accept -V 192.168.0.1 -S 192.168.0.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0/0

... end of -I rules ...
</para>

<para>
Using -O (output) rules: 
</para>

<para>
This is the slower method to block traffic because the packets go through 
masquerading first before they are dropped.  Yet, this rule even stops the 
firewall machine from accessing the forbidden site.
</para>

<para>
... start of -O rules ...

# reject and log outgoing to 204.50.10.13

... end of -O rules ...
</para>

<para>
Using -F (forward) rules: 
</para>

<para>
Probably slower than -I (input) rules for blocking traffic, this still only 
stops masqueraded machines (e.g. internal machines).   The firewall machine 
can still reach forbidden site(s).
</para>

<para>
... start of -F rules ...

# Reject and log from local net on PPP interface to 204.50.10.13.

... end of -F rules ...
</para>

<para>
There is no need for a special rule to allow machines on the 192.168.0.0/24 
network to go to 204.50.11.0. Why?  It is already covered by the global MASQ 
rule.
</para>

<para>
NOTE:  There is more than one way of coding the interfaces in the above rules.  
For example instead of "-V 192.168.255.1" you can code "-W eth0", instead of 
"-V $ppp_ip" , you can use "-W ppp0".  The "-V" method was phased out with the 
imgration to IPCHAINS, but for IPFWADM users, its more of a personal choice and 
documentation.

<para>
Masquerading more than one internal network is fairly simple.  You need to 
first make sure that all of your networks are running correctly (both internal 
and external).  You then need to enable traffic to pass to both the other internal 
interfaces and to be MASQed to the Internet.

Next, you need to enable Masquerading on the INTERNAL interfaces.  This 
example uses a total of THREE interfaces:  EXTIF stands for the eth0 interface 
which is the EXTERNAL connection to the Internet.  INTIF stands for the eth1 interface
and is the 192.168.0.0 network. Finally, INTIF2 stands for the eth2 interface and 
is the 192.168.1.0 network.  Both INTIF and INTIF2 will be MASQed out of 
interface eth0 or EXTIF.  In your rc.firewall ruleset next to the existing MASQ 
at the very end of the ruleset, add the following:

<Sect1 id="Forwarders">
<Title>IPPORTFW, IPMASQADM, IPAUTOFW, REDIR, UDPRED, and other Port Forwarding 
tools </Title>

<para>
IPPORTFW, IPAUTOFW, REDIR, UDPRED, and other programs are generic TCP and/or 
UDP port forwarding tools for Linux IP Masquerade (for < 2.4 kernels).  These 
tools are typically used with or as a replacement for specific IP MASQ modules 
to get a specific network traffic through the MASQ server.  
</para>
<para>
With port forwarders, you can redirect data connections from the Internet to 
an internal, privately addressed machine behind your IP MASQ server.  This 
forwarding ability includes network protocols such as TELNET, WWW, SMTP, FTP 
(with a special patch - see below), ICQ, and many others.
</para>

<para>
<Emphasis role="strong">NOTE:  </Emphasis>If you are just looking to do simple 
port forwarding but you don't need Masquerading support, you don't have any 
choice.  You will <Emphasis role="strong">STILL NEED</Emphasis> to enable IP 
Masquerading support in the kernel AND either run a IPTABLES, IPCHAINS, or 
IPFWADM ruleset to be able to use Linux's port forwarding tools.
</para>

<para>
So why all the different choices?  MARK (MFW), IPMASQADM (PORTFW or AUTOFW), 
IPPORTFW, IPAUTOFW, REDIR, and UDPRED (all URLs are in 
<XRef LinkEnd="ipmasq-compiling3.1.3">) were the various tools available to IP 
MASQ users to allow this type of functionality.  Later, as the Linux IP 
Masquerade feature matured, many of these tools were eventually replaced by 
the PORTFW and MARK systems which are more intelligent solutions.  
</para>
<para>
In recent 2.2.x kernels, the IPMASQADM tool combined the IPAUTOFW and IPPORTFW 
2.0.x kernel tools into one binary.  Both the IPMASQADM tool and IPTABLES also 
supports a new mechanism called "MARK" or MFW.  The MARK system works where a 
specific IPTABLES or IPCHAINS ruleset would match a given packet sequence.
Once matched, the tool would "mark" these packets.  Later, the IPMASQADM 
tool or a specific IPTABLE "table" could be instructed to change these packets 
as needed and forward them off to their desired destination.  Currently, this 
HOWTO doesn't cover the MARK solution but it will in the near future.
</para>
<para>
Anyway, because of the availablity of the newer tools, it is *HIGHLY 
DISCOURAGED* to use the old tools such as IPAUTOFW (even AUTOFW in IPMASQADM) 
and REDIR because they don't properly notify the Linux kernel of their 
presence and can ultimately <Emphasis role="strong">CRASH</Emphasis> your 
Linux server with extreme use.  
</para>

<para>
<Emphasis role="strong">NOTE #2:  </Emphasis>With enabling PORTFW functionality 
in ANY 2.2/2.0 Linux kernel (not 2.4.x), <Emphasis role="strong">internal 
machines typically CANNOT use the same "external" PORTFWed IP address to 
access a given internal" machine.</Emphasis>  To put it another way, PORTFW 
was only intended to be used with "external" computers on the Internet.  If 
this is an issue for you, you can also implement the REDIR tool for 2.2.x and 
2.0.x kernels to let internal machines get redirected to the internal servers 
too.  The 2.4.x kernels running IPTABLES solves this issue once and for all and 
is covered in a FAQ entry in <XRef LinkEnd="PORTFW-local">.  If you would like 
a technical explination on why this internal/external forwarding doesn't work, 
please page down towards the bottom of the 2.2.x PORTFW section for a note from 
Juan Jose Ciarlante.
</para>

<para>
NOTE #3: The forwarding of FTP server traffic to an internal MASQed FTP server, 
known as <Emphasis role="strong">PORTFW FTP</Emphasis>, is now fully supported 
in the 2.4.x kernels as well as in the 2.2.x kernels via a BETA version FTP 
kernel module (does NOT come with the stock Linus kernels).  It should also be 
noted that you can also PORTFW FTP traffic using an external FTP proxy program 
(not covered in this HOWTO).  It should be noted that the Beta 2.2.x FTP 
kernel module code is still experimental and some people get better results 
simply using ACTIVE FTP sessions compared to PASSIVE connections.  
Interestingly enough, other people have seen the exact opposite behavior.  
Please let us know what your results are like.  More about this is 
covered below in both the 2.2.x and 2.0.x sections as the solutions require
the use of different patches.
</para>

<para>
<Emphasis role="strong">WARNING!</Emphasis>  Before jumping right into 
installing ANY of these tools, it needs to be mentioned that network security 
can be an issue with <Emphasis>ANY</Emphasis> PORT FORWARD tool.  The reason 
for this is because these tools basically create a hole in strong packet 
firewalls for the required TCP/UDP ports.  Though this doesn't pose any threat 
to your Linux machine, it might be an issue to the PORTFW'ed internal 
machine(s).  No worries though, this is what Steven Clarke (the author of 
IPPORTFW) had to say about that:
</para>

<para>
<Screen>
   "Port Forwarding is only called within masquerading functions so it 
   fits inside the same IPFWADM/IPCHAINS rules. Masquerading is an extension to 
   IP forwarding. Therefore, ipportfw only sees a packet if it fits 
   both the input and masquerading ipfwadm rule sets."
</Screen>
</para>

<para>
What that means in English is that if you have a strong packet firewall
running, PORTFW doesn't directly bypass any of that security.  You will still 
be able to allow or deny specific IPs and/or domains to this new PORTFW'ed 
resource if you so wish.
</para>

<para>
With this said, it's important to have a strong firewall ruleset.  Please see

Running the rc.firewall-iptables-stronger ruleset?  Good for you!  To get PORTFW
running with this ruleset, it's very easy.  The following example is for HTTP 
(WWW) traffic to be PORTFWed to the IP address indicated by the $PORTFWIP 
variable:
<ItemizedList>

  <para>Take the ruleset lines shown above (for the generic rc.firewall 
        ruleset) and place them just after the "<Literal remap="tt">#FORWARD 
        Enable Forwarding and thus IPMASQ</Literal>" comment lines.  It should 
        also be noted that you <Emphasis role="strong">DO NOT</Emphasis> have 
        to enable the "HTTPD" rules under the "Optional 'INPUT' section" for
        2.4-based kernels.   With 2.4 kernels, those lines are ONLY used if 
        you want to allow HTTP traffic to terminate on the MASQ server's httpd
        process (Apache).

<Emphasis role="strong">PORTFW FTP:  </Emphasis>If you have the 
"ip_conntrack_ftp" and "ip_nat_ftp" kernel modules loaded into kernel space 
(as already done in the rc.firewall-iptables script), the simple PREROUTING command 
like the one shown above changed for for port "21" should do the trick.  This 
is much easier than the configuration for the old 2.2.x / 2.0.x kernels!
</para>

<para>
Please note, if you setup PORTFW to an internal FTP server that is running 
on a NON-standard FTP port, say port 8021, you MUST tell the 
"ip_conntrack_ftp" module about the new FTP port.  The reason for this is 
that FTP is not a NAT-friendly protocol.  By telling the NAT module about this 
new non-standard FTP port, the NAT module and do it's job again.  To do this, 
edit your rc.firewall file and change the loading of the FTP module to look 
something like this:

<Emphasis role="strong">PORTFW Redirection of Internal requests:</Emphasis>
</para>

<para>
In the past, if users PORTFWed port 80 on their EXTERNAL IP address to some 
internal machine, only machines out on the Internet would properly reach
this internal WWW server.  If you tried to contact this internal WWW server
via the MASQ server's EXTERNAL address, it would fail.  Fortunately, there is 
a workaround for 2.2.x and 2.0.x kernels using the REDIR tool.  Even better, 
the use of the REDIR tool is NOT required for the 2.4.x kernels.  To support 
redirection like this from an internal host, add a rule like the one shown
below ABOVE the "Catch all" FORWARDing rule in the rc.firewall file.  The 
following example will REDIRECT internal WWW traffic to the 192.168.0.2 
internal machine (please change the IP address to reflect your configuration):

PORTFW FTP:  As mentioned above, there are two solutions for forwarding FTP 
server traffic to an internal MASQed PC.  The first solution *IS* a BETA level 
<Emphasis role="strong">IP_MASQ_FTP</Emphasis> module for 2.2.x kernels to PORT 
Forward FTP connections to an internal MASQed FTP server.  The other method is 
using a FTP proxy program (the URL is in <XRef LinkEnd="kernel-2.2.x-Requirements">.  
It should also be noted that the FTP kernel module also supports the adding of 
additional PORTFW FTP ports on the fly without the requirement of unloading and 
reloading the IP_MASQ_FTP module and thus breaking any existing FTP transfers.  
You can find more about this new code at the IPMASQ WWW site at

From Juanjo Ciarlante
--

&#62;If I use:
&#62;
&#62; ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp  -L 1.2.3.4 80 -R 192.168.2.3 80
&#62;
&#62;Everything works great from the outside but internal requests for the same
&#62;1.2.3.4 address fail. Are there chains that will allow a machine on localnet 
&#62;192.168.2.0 to accesss www.periapt.com without using a proxy? 

Actually not.

I usually setup a ipmasqadm rule for outside, *AND* a port
redirector for inside. This works because ipmasqadm hooks before
redir will get the eventual outside connection, _but_ leaves things
ok if not (stated by APPROPIATE rules).

The actual "conceptual" problem comes from the TRUE client (peer) IP
goal (thanks to masq) being in the same net as target server.

The failing scenario for "local masq" is :
   client: 192.168.2.100
   masq:   192.168.2.1
   serv:   192.168.2.10

1)client-&#62;server packet
 a) client:  192.168.2.100:1025  -&#62; 192.168.2.1:80   [SYN]
 b) (masq):  192.168.2.100:1025  -&#62; 192.168.2.10:80  [SYN]
            (and keep  192.168.2.1:61000 192.168.2.100:1025 related)
 c) serv:    gets masqed packet (1b)

2)server-&#62;client packet
 a) serv:    192.168.2.10:80     -&#62; 192.168.2.100:1025  [SYN,ACK]
 b) client:  192.168.2.100:1025  -&#62; 192.168.2.10:80     [RST]

Now take a moment to compare (1a) with (2a).
You see, the server replied DIRECTLY to client bypassing masq (not
letting masq to UNDO the packet hacking) because it is in SAME net, so
the client resets the connection.

hope I helped.

Warm regards

Port Forwarding FTP servers:
</para>

<para>
If you plan on port forwarding FTP to an internal machine, things get more 
complicated.  The reason for this is because the standard 
<Emphasis role="strong">IP_MASQ_FTP</Emphasis> kernel module wasn't written 
for this though some users report that it works without any problems.  
Personally, without the patch, I've heard that extended file transfers in 
excess of 30 minutes will fail without the patch while other users swear that 
it works flawlessly.  Anyway, I recommend that you try the following PORTFW 
instruction with the STOCK ip_masq_ftp module and see if it works for you.  If 
it doesn't, try using the modified ip_masq_ftp module.
</para>

<para>
For those who need the module, Fred Viles wrote a modified IP_MASQ_FTP module 
to make things work.  If you are curious what EXACTLY are the issues, download 
the following archive since Fred documents it quite well.  Also understand that 
this patch is somewhat experimental and should be treated as such.  It should 
be noted that this patch is ONLY available for the 2.0.x kernels though there 
is a different patch available for 2.2.x kernels.

ICQ, the instant messaging client now owned by AOL, has changed over the

any special NAT modules, PORTFW tricks, etc.
</para>

IF, for some reason, you want to run an OLD ICQ client, you can read this
section.  If not, just IGNORE all this info.   I am leaving this in the
HOWTO demonstrate large a LARGE PORTFW example.
</para>
<para>
There are three methods of getting ICQ to work behind a Linux MASQ server.  
These solutions include the use the ICQ Masq module (for 2.2.x and 2.0.x 
kernels), using IPPORTFW for basic ICQ functionality, or setting up a SOCKS 
proxy server.  
</para>

<para>
MODULE:  The ICQ module was written for the older generation of ICQ clients
for both the 2.2.x and 2.0.x kernels.  This module allows for the simple 
setup of multiple ICQ users behind a MASQ server.  It also doesn't require any 
special changes to the ICQ client(s).  Recently, AOL changed the protocol and
ports used for ICQ.  Because of this, many users might find that the
ip_masq_icq module will no longer help them.  For users of the older ICQ 
clients, the 2.2.x version of the module supports file transfer and 
read-time chat.  The 2.0.x kernel module doesn't support file transfers 
and there is no module available for the 2.4.x kernels.
</para>

<para>
PORTFW: Your next option is to use port forwarding.  With port forwarding, 
basic ICQ chat will work but file transfers might not be very reliable.  Please 
see below for an example of how to configure ICQ PORTFW.
</para>

<para>
SOCKS:  Finally, your last and possibly best option is to setup a SOCKS proxy 
server on your Linux machine.  This service can happily co-exist with the MASQ 
service and ICQ should be fully functional regardless of what Linux kernel 
version you are running.  The use of a SOCKS server will require ALL ICQ
clients to be reconfigured to use it and the installation and configuration
of a SOCKS server has nothing to do with IP Masquerade.  Because of this,
SOCKS is not covered in this HOWTO.

    Once your new rc.firewall is ready, reload the ruleset to make sure things 
    are OK by simply typing in "/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall".  If you get any errors,

    Now, in ICQ's Preferences--&#62;Connection, configure it to be "Behind a 
    LAN" and "Behind a firewall or Proxy".  Now, click on "Firewall Settings" 
    and configure it to be "I don't use a SOCK5 proxy".  Also note that it was 
    previously recommended to change ICQ's "Firewall session timeouts" to "30" 
    seconds BUT many users have found that ICQ becomes unreliable.  It has been 
    found that ICQ is more reliable with its stock timeout setting (don't 
    enable that ICQ option) and simply change MASQ's timeout to 160 seconds.  
    You can see how to change this timeout in <XRef
LinkEnd="rc.firewall-ipfwadm"> 
    and <XRef LinkEnd="rc.firewall-ipchains"> rulesets.  Finally, click on Next 
    and configure ICQ to "Use the following TCP listen ports.." from "2000" to 
    "2020".  Now click done.

    Now ICQ will tell you that you will have to restart ICQ for the changes to

    A user once told me that by simply portforwarding port 4000 to his ICQ

    settings.  Your mileage might vary on this topic but I thought you might

<Sect1 id="LooseUDP">
<Title>Gamers:  The LooseUDP patch</Title>

<para>
The LooseUDP patch allows semi-NAT-friendly games that usually use UDP 
connections to both WORK behind a Linux IP Masquerade server.  
</para>

<para>
What the LooseUDP patch does is allow ALL UDP packets to be NATed 
through the MASQ box without any checks or expiration.  This liberal 
forwarding method is considered insecure by many and is disabled in modern
2.2.x kernels.  The 2.4.x kernels with it's IPTABLES stateful UDP inspection 
only allows incoming UDP packets into the machine (and thus MASQ) if there was 
already an outbound UDP packet to that same host in it's stateful table.  If
the MASQ host hasn't sent a UDP packet to the remote host within ~30 seconds,
the return UDP table entry is deleted.  Because of this, IPTABLES removes most 
of the need for the LooseUDP patch as it does it in a more secure fashion.
</para>

<para>
Currently, LooseUDP is available as a patch for 2.0.36+ kernels and it is 
already built into 2.2.3+ kernels though it is now DISABLED by DEFAULT in 
2.2.16+ (please see the example rc.firewal ruleset comments for details).  
</para>


<para>
To get LooseUDP running on a 2.0.x kernel, follow the following steps:

<ItemizedList>
<listitem>
<para>
Have the newest 2.0.x kernel sources uncompressed in the /usr/src/linux directory
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED for v2.0.x:  Download and install the IPPORTFW patch from 
<XRef LinkEnd="ipmasq-compiling3.1.3">and as described in 
<XRef LinkEnd="Forwarders">of the HOWTO.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Download the LooseUDP patch from <XRef LinkEnd="ipmasq-compiling3.1.3"> 
</para>

<para>
Now, put the LooseUDP patch in the /usr/src/linux directory.   Once this is 
done, type in:
</para>

<para>
<Screen>
For a compressed patch file:  zcat loose-udp-2.0.36.patch.gz &verbar; patch -p1
</Screen>
</para>

<para>
<Screen>
For a NON-compressed patch file:  cat loose-udp-2.0.36.patch &verbar; patch -p1
</Screen>
</para>

<para>
Now, depending on the version of your "patch", You will then see the following text:
</para>

<para>
<Screen>
patching file `CREDITS'
patching file `Documentation/Configure.help'
patching file `include/net/ip_masq.h'
patching file `net/ipv4/Config.in'
patching file `net/ipv4/ip_masq.c'
</Screen>
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
If you see the text "Hunk FAILED" only ONCE and ONLY ONCE at the very 
beginning of the patching, don't be alarmed.  You probably have an old patch 
file (this has been fixed) but it still works.  If it fails completely, make 
sure you have applied the IPPORTFW kernel patch FIRST.
</para>

<para>
Once the patch is installed, re-configure the kernel as shown in 
<XRef LinkEnd="ipmasq-compiling3.1.3"> and be sure to say "Y" to the 
"IP: loose UDP port managing (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_IP_MASQ_LOOSE_UDP) [Y/n/?]" 
option.
</para>
</listitem>

</ItemizedList>

</para>

<para>
To get LooseUDP running on a 2.2.x kernel, follow the following steps:

<ItemizedList>

<listitem>
<para>
In the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall script, goto the BOTTOM of the file and find the 
LooseUDP section.  Change the "0" in the line:
<Literal>echo "0" &#62; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_masq_udp_dloose</Literal>
to a "1" and re-run the rc.firewall ruleset.  An example of this is given in 
both <XRef LinkEnd="rc.firewall-ipchains"> example and 
<XRef LinkEnd="rc.firewall-ipfwadm-stronger"> example.
</para>
</listitem>

</ItemizedList>

</para>

<para>
NOTE:  The LooseUDP code is /not/ available (?required?) for the 2.4.x kernels 
<ItemizedList>
 <listitem>
  <para>
   See the begining of this section for all the details.

   Basically, the old 2.0.x / 2.2.x LooseUDP code was considered a security 
   issue.  Because of this, it was removed from the kernel.  Fortunately, some 
   games that used to require the LooseUDP code on the 2.2.x IPCHAINS system 
   might work just final under the 2.4.x IPTABLES kernels.  If the games don't 
   work, I'm not aware of a solution for you.   Sorry.
  </para>
 </listitem>
</ItemizedList>
</para>

<para>
Once you are running the new LooseUDP enabled kernel, you should be good to go 
for most NAT-friendly games.  Some URLs have been given for patches to make 
games like BattleZone and others NAT friendly.  Please see 
<XRef LinkEnd="Game-Clients"> for more details.

<Title>( Requirements ) - What are the minimum hardware requirements and any

A 486/66 box with 16MB of RAM was more than sufficient to fill a 1.54Mb/s T1

<Sect1 id="what-is-masq">
<Title>( NAT vs. Proxy ) - How does IP Masquerade differ from Proxy or NAT services? </Title>

<para>
<ProgramListing>
Proxy:  Proxy servers are available for: Win95, NT, Linux, Solaris, etc.

            Pro:    + (1) IP address ; cheap
                    + Optional caching for better performance (WWW, etc.)

            Con:    - All applications behind the proxy server must both SUPPORT 
                      proxy services (SOCKS) and be CONFIGURED to use the Proxy 
                      server
                    - Screws up WWW counters and WWW statistics

	 A proxy server uses only (1) public IP address, like IP MASQ, and acts  
	 as a translator to clients on the private LAN (WWW browser, etc.).
	 This proxy server receives requests like TELNET, FTP, WWW, 
	 etc. from the private network on one interface.  It would then in turn,
	 initiate these requests as if someone on the local box was making the
	 requests.   Once the remote Internet server sends back the requested
	 information, it would re-translate the TCP/IP addresses back to the 
	 internal MASQ client and send traffic to the internal requesting host.  
	 This is why it is called a PROXY server.  

		Note:  ANY applications that you might want to use on the 
			internal machines *MUST* have proxy server support 
			like Netscape and some of the better TELNET and FTP 
			clients.  Any clients that don't support proxy servers 
			won't work.

	 Another nice thing about proxy servers is that some of them
	 can also do caching (Squid for WWW).  So, imagine that you have 50 
	 proxied hosts all loading Netscape at once.  If they were installed 
	 with the default homepage URL, you would have 50 copies of the same 
	 Netscape WWW page coming over the WAN link for each respective computer.  
	 With a caching proxy server, only one copy would be downloaded by the 
         proxy server and then the proxied machines would get the WWW page from 
         the cache.  Not only does this save bandwidth on the Internet 
         connection, it will be MUCH MUCH faster for the internal proxied 
         machines.



MASQ:	 IP Masq is available on Linux and a few ISDN routers such
 or	 as the Zytel Prestige128, Cisco 770, NetGear ISDN routers, etc.
1:Many
 NAT	 
		Pro: 	+ Only (1) IP address needed (cheap)
			+ Doesn't require special application support
			+ Uses firewall software so your network can become
			  more secure

		Con:	- Requires a Linux box or special ISDN router
			  (though other products might have this..  )
			- Incoming traffic cannot access your internal LAN
			  unless the internal LAN initiates the traffic or
			  specific port forwarding software is installed.
			  Many NAT servers CANNOT provide this functionality.
			- Special protocols need to be uniquely handled by
			  firewall redirectors, etc.  Linux has full support
			  for this (FTP, IRC, etc.) capabilty but many routers
			  do NOT (NetGear DOES). 

	 Masq or 1:Many NAT is similar to a proxy server in the sense that the 
	 server will perform IP address translation and fake out the remote server 
	 (WWW for example) as if the MASQ server made the request instead of an 
	 internal machine.  
	
	 The major difference between a MASQ and PROXY server is that MASQ servers
	 don't need any configuration changes to all the client machines.  Just 
	 configure them to use the linux box as their default gateway and everything 
	 will work fine.  You WILL need to install special Linux modules for things 
	 like RealAudio, FTP, etc. to work)!  

	 Also, many users operate IP MASQ for TELNET, FTP, etc. *AND* also setup a 
	 caching proxy on the same Linux box for WWW traffic for the additional 
	 performance.


NAT:	 NAT servers are available on Windows 95/NT, Linux, Solaris, and some 
	 of the better ISDN routers (not Ascend)	 

		Pro: 	+ Very configurable
			+ No special application software needed

		Con:	- Requires a subnet from your ISP (expensive)

	 Network Address Translation is the name for a box that would have a pool of 
	 valid IP addresses on the Internet interface which it can use.  Whenever the
	 Internal network wanted to go to the Internet, it associates an available 
	 VALID IP address from the Internet interface to the original requesting 
	 PRIVATE IP address.  After that, all traffic is re-written from the NAT 
	 public IP address to the NAT private address.  Once the associated PUBLIC 
	 NAT address becomes idle for some pre-determined amount of time, the 
	 PUBLIC IP address is returned back into the public NAT pool.  

	 The major problem with NAT is, once all of the free public IP addresses are
	 used, any additional private users requesting Internet service are out of
	 luck until a public NAT address becomes free.

<Sect1 id="MTU-issues">
<Title>( MTU ) - IP MASQ seems to be working fine but some sites don't work.  
This usually happens with WWW and some FTP sites.</Title>

<para>
Depending on what Linux kernel version you are running on the MASQ server, 
some will people disagree on the real problem.  The two following arguments 
have valid points, are inter-related, and users from each camp continue to 
debate this to this day.  

<ItemizedList>
 <listitem>
  <para>
   With modern 2.4.x Linux systems, most users point their finger at the 
   adminstrators of these remote broken sites (typically SSL-encrypted WWW
   sites, etc.) or your MASQ server's upstream router run by your ISP.  The
   main though it that these machines are either filtering or not properly 
   responding to SOME or ALL FORMS of ICMP packets (specifically ICMP Code 3 
   Type 4 - Fragmentation Needed) messages due to a fray of misplaced security 
   paranoia.  
   </para>

   <para>
   What does that all mean?  Basically, say your machine is connected to the 
   Internet with a MTU of 1492 bytes (Maximum Transmission Unit -- the maximum 
   packet size your computer can transmit) which is common for PPPoE users.  
   At the same time, the remote WWW/FTP site is connected to the Internet at a 
   MTU of 1500 bytes.  The way that TCP/IP works is that when a TCP connection 
   is being negotiated for your HTTP / FTP  connection, the remote side will 
   try to verify that a 1500 byte packet can reach your computer via the 
   initial TCP "SYN" packet.  
   </para>

   <para>
   Since the packet is too big for your connection, your upstream router (run 
   by your ISP) will send a ICMP 3:4 (fragmentation needed) packet back to the 
   remote WWW / FTP server.  Within this packet is a recommended smaller MTU 
   size to retry with.  The problem is that either your local upstream router, 
   some router between you and the remote server, or the remote HTTP / FTP 
   server is either misconfigured or has a firewall in front of it that is 
   BLOCKing these ICMP packets.
   </para>
 </listitem>

 <listitem>
  <para>
  The final UNCOMMON possibility is a debatable 2.0 / 2.2 kernel bug in the 
  IPMASQ code.  Some users point their finger to the fact that IPMASQ might 
  have problems with ICMP packets that have the DF or "Don't Fragment" bit set.  
  Basically, when a MASQ box connects to the Internet with an MTU of anything 
  less than 1500, some packets will have the DF field set.  Though changing 
  the MTU of the MASQ server's Internet link to 1500 seemingly fixes the 
  problem, the possible bug is still there.  What is believed to be happening 
  in these older kernels is that the MASQ code is not properly re-writing the 
  return IP addresses of the ICMP 3 Sub 4 code packets back to the originating 
  MASQed computer.  Because of this, these critical packets get dropped.

<Sect2>
<Title>Enabling PMTU Clamping for PPPoE and some PPP Users:</Title>

  <para>
  For those users who use PPPoE clients for (DSL / Cablemodem) or PPP (Dialup), 
  your Internet connection is NOT "eth0" (for example) but usually "ppp0".   
  In addition to this, your Internet link's MTU or Maximum Transmission Unit 
  (largest packet you can transmit over the Internet) isn't 1500 bytes but 
  1492.  The 1492 byte MTU comes from the link size of Ethernet (1518 bytes) - 
  Ethernet MAC overhead (18) = 1500.  Then you subtract the PPPoE header (8 
  bytes) == MTU of 1492.  This overhead isn't a big deal but sometimes ISPs or 
  remote Internet sites do stupid things to break PPPoE or non-1500 byte MTU 
  connected machines.

<Sect2>
<Title>Clamping the MSS via IPTABLES:</Title>

 <para>
 As mentioned above for PPPoE users, some ISPs and WWW sites filter critical
 ICMP packets like MTU Path Discovery.  Because of this, many users might find
 more Internet sites work but others hang or work poorly.  Fortunately, 
 recent IPTABLES have added PMTU Clamping support which should help you.  If 
 your using IPTABLES and think you're hitting this issue, try adding the 
 following line to the end of your rc.firewall-iptables ruleset.  It should be noted
 that there is no PMTU clamping support in IPCHAINS.

 <screen>

 iptables -I FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu 
 </screen>
 </para>

 <para>
 If this line causes an error when you re-run the rc.firewall-iptables* firewall

 the "TCPMSS" IPTABLES module.

 is.  To do so, run "/bin/ifconfig" on the MASQ server.  Look at the lines 
 that corresponds to your Internet connection and look for the MTU (for
 example, ppp0).  This NEEDs to be set to 1500.  Usually, Ethernet links 
 will default to 1500 for Ethernet but serial / DIALUP modem PPP links might 
 default to 576.

   To change the MTU on a standard Ethernet link to your bridged or routed

   To change the MTU issue on a PPP (not PPPoE) Internet link, edit your

   CUA Users: Lastly, though this isn't a common problem, some Linux 2.0.x 
   kernel users have found a MTU solution to the following problem.  With PPP 
   users, verify what port is your PPPd code connecting to.  Is it a /dev/cua* 
   port or a /dev/ttyS* port?  It NEEDS to be a /dev/ttyS* port as the 
   /dev/cua* device ststem has been deprecated and it breaks some things in 
   very odd ways.

<Title>Changing the MTU of various operating systems:</Title>

<para>
If you reconfigure ALL of your MASQed PCs to use the SAME MTU as your external 
Internet link's MTU (for example, 1492 for PPPoE users), everything should 
work fine and this method is sometimes the MOST EFFECTIVE way of fixing things.  
This is including ALL of the solutions mentioned above.  But doing things this 
way can be a lot of work if there are lots of internal MASQed machines or be
even impossible to do if you don't have administrative access to all the 
internal MASQed machines. 
</para>

<para>
Follow these simple steps for your respective operating system:  
</para>
<para>
The follow examples utilize an MTU of 1492 for typical PPPoE connections for 
some DSL and Cablemodem users.  It is recommended to use the HIGHEST values 
possible for all connections that are 128Kb/s and faster.  
It should be noted that some PPPoE ISPs might require an MTU setting of 1460 
(not 1492) for proper connectivity due to additional overhead in the ISP's 
internal network.  
</para>

<para>
The only real reason to use smaller MTUs than 1492 or 1460 is to lower your
Internet link's latency but at the cost of throughput.  Please see

<para>

<ProgramListing>
------------------------------------------
1. The setting of MTU can vary from Linux distribution to distribution.  

   For Redhat: You need to edit the various "ifconfig" statements in 
               the /sbin/ifup script

   For Slackware: You need to edit the various "ifconfig" statements in 
                  the /etc/rc.d/rc1.inet

2. Here is one good, any-distribution-will-work example, edit the 
   /etc/rc.d/rc.local file and put the following at the END of the file: 

        echo "Changing the MTU of ETH0"
        /sbin/ifconfig eth0 mtu 1492

     Replace "eth0" with the interface name that is the machine's upstream 
     connection which is connected to the Internet.

3. For advanced options like "TCP Receive Windows" and such, detailed examples
   on how to edit the respective networking scripts for your specific Linux
   distro, etc., please see Chapter 16 of

Basically, say your domain, acme.com, has an external IP address is 1.2.3.4 
and you are PORTFWing all WWW traffic to an internal machine, say, 
192.168.0.20.  Then as an /internal/ user, you are trying to contact 
to http://www.acme.com and expect things to work.  Well, that isn't correct.
Basically, http://www.acme.com is being resolved to the IP of http://1.2.3.4.  
What you really should doing is contacting http://192.168.0.20.
</para>

<para>
See the difference?
</para>

<para>
The proper solution to this is to setup a SPLIT DNS server.  Internal users
would be configured to use the /internal/ DNS server which would reply with 
the 192.168.0.20 address when asked for www.acme.com.  All external users 
will get a reply from the /external/ server resolving to the the 1.2.3.4 IP 
address.  From there, IPTABLES/IPCHAINS/IPFWADM would then PORTFW the traffic
to the 192.168.0.20 server like normal.

<para>
Another alternative if you only have a few internal machines
is to setup a "hosts" file entry on all internal machines.
That entry would basically look like:

    With the use of various firewall rulesets, a given ruleset can either 
    DENY (silently drop) or REJECT traffic (sends back a ICMP error).  If 
    firewall logging is enabled, the errors will show up in the SYSLOG
    "messages" file found at:

        Redhat: 	/var/log
        Slackware:	/var/adm

    If you take a look at one of these firewall logs, you would see something 
    like:

                  255 (depends on the operating system) and if that number 
                  ever reaches (0), it means that realistically, the packet 
                  was lost in a network loop and should be deleted. 

    - IPCHAINS: the packet's TOS markings (type of service which basically
                means class of service) was 0x00 or zero.

<Title>( Log Reduction ) - My logs are filling up with packet hits due to the 
new "stronger" rulesets.  How can I fix this? </Title>

<para>
So your realizing that a good firewall is catching a LOT of bad Internet
traffic.  That's a good thing but it's also filling up your logs to the point
that you won't read them; that's bad.
What to do?
</para>
<para>
What you need to figure out is what traffic you DON"T want to log, explicitly 
match those packets in the firewall, and NOT log the packets when you drop
them.
</para>

<para>
For example, the TrinityOS firewall ruleset in section 10.7 (this would be a 
"strongest" ruleset in IPMASQ speak) gives some ideas:
<ULink

</para>

<para>
Things I recommend to filter:
<ItemizedList>
 <listitem>
   <para>All RFC1918 address space (TCP/IP address ranges: 10.x.y.z/8,
172.16-31.y.z/12, and 192.168.y.x/16).  You should /never/ receive these
packets from an Internet connection.  If you do, they are most likely spoofed
packets</para>
 </listitem>
 <listitem>
   <para>Windows File and Print Sharing (Samba or CIFS): ports 137, 138, 139, 
and 445.  Windows machines like to talk a lot though most computers don't care
what they're saying.</para>
 </listitem>
 <listitem>
   <para>Class-D Multicast addresses (if you don't use Multicast): 224.0.0.0/4

   <para>Class-E and F "future" addresses: 240.0.0.0/5  and 248.0.0.0/5
</para>
 </listitem>
</ItemizedList>
</para>

<para>
To a much lesser extent, you might want to filter other packets.  I recommend
that you verify that you are receiving these specific packet types before
you filter them out.
<ItemizedList>
  <listitem>
    <para>RIP (the routing protocol): port 520</para>
  </listitem>
 <listitem>
   <para>Some specific forms of ICMP packets - NOT all of them (that will 
break your machine and IPMASQ in general)</para>
 </listitem>
</ItemizedList>
</para>

<para>
Finally, you'll probably find that some individual TCP/IP address out on the
Internet always seem to attack your IP.  So, in addition to filtering various
PORTS like above, you might want to also filter by specific SOURCE IP address 
too.  After all, it is *YOUR* firewall.

<Sect1 id="masq-host-security">
<Title>( MASQ Security ) - Can I configure IP MASQ to allow Internet users to

<para>
Yes!  With IPPORTFW, you can allow ALL or only a select few Internet hosts to

<Sect1 id="No-Free-Ports">
<Title>( Free Ports ) - I'm getting "kernel: ip_masq_new(proto=UDP): no free ports." in my 
SYSLOG files.  Whats up?</Title>

<para>
One of your internal MASQed machines are creating an abnormally high number of 
packets destined for the Internet.  As the IP Masq server builds the MASQ 
table and forwards these packets out over the Internet, the table is quickly 
filling.  Once the table is filled, it will give you this error.
</para>

<para>
The only application that I have known which temporarily creates this situation 
is a gaming program called "GameSpy".  Why?  Gamespy builds a server list and 
then pings all of the servers in the list (1000s of game servers).  By creating 
all these pings, it creates 1,000s of quick connections in a VERY short period 
of time.  Until these sessions timeout via the IP MASQ timeouts, the MASQ tables 
become "FULL".  
</para>

<para>
So what can you do about it?  Realistically, don't use programs that do things 
like this.  If you do get this error in your logs, find it and stop using it.  
If you really like GameSpy, just don't refresh the server too often.  
Regardless, once you stop running this MASQ'ed program, this MASQ error will 
go away as these connections will eventually timeout in the MASQ tables.

The first way to work around this problem is to configure IPPORTFW from 
<XRef LinkEnd="Forwarders"> and portfw TCP ports 137, 138, and 139 to the 
internal Windows machine's IP address.  Though this solution works, it would 
only work for ONE internal machine.
</para>

<para>
The second solution is to install and configure 
<ULink URL="http://www.samba.org">Samba</ULink> on the Linux MASQ server.  
With Samba running, you can then map your internal Windows File and Print 
shares onto the Samba server.  Then, you can mount these newly mounted SMB 
shares to all of your external clients.  Configuring Samba is fully covered 
in a HOWTO found in a Linux Documentation Project and in the TrinityOS document 
as well.
</para>

<para>
The third solution is to configure a VPN (virtual private network) between the 
two Windows machines or between the two networks.  This can either be done via 
the PPTP or IPSEC VPN solutions.  There is a <XRef LinkEnd="VPNs"> patch for 
Linux and also a full IPSEC implementation available for both 2.0.x and 2.2.x 
kernels.  This solution would probably be the most reliable and secure method 
of all three solutions.

All of these solutions are NOT covered by this HOWTO.  I recommend that you 
look at the TrinityOS documentation for IPSEC help and John Hardin's PPTP 
page for more information.

<Title>( IRC DCC ) - mIRC doesn't work with DCC Sends</Title>

<para>
This is a configuration problem on your copy of mIRC.  To fix this, first 
disconnect mIRC from the IRC server.  Now in mIRC, go to File --&#62; Setup 
and click on the "IRC servers tab".  Make sure that it is set to port 6667.  
If you require other ports, see below.  Next, goto File --&#62; Setup --&#62; 
Local Info and clear the fields for Local Host and IP Addresses.  Now select 
the checkboxes for "LOCAL HOST" and "IP address" (IP address may be checked 
but disabled).  Next under "Lookup Method", configure it for "normal".  It

If you require IRC server ports other than 6667, (for example, 6969) you need

<Sect1 id="aliasing">
<Title>( IP Aliasing ) - Can IP Masquerade work with only ONE Ethernet network card?</Title>

<para>
<Emphasis role="strong">Yes and no</Emphasis>. With the "IP Alias" kernel 
feature, users can setup multiple aliased interfaces such as eth0:1, eth0:2, 
etc but its is NOT recommended to use aliased interfaces for IP Masquerading.  
Why?  Providing a secure firewall becomes very difficult with a single NIC 
card.  In addition to this, you will experience an abnormal amount of errors 
on this link since incoming packets will almost simultaneously be sent out 
at the same time.  Because of all this and NIC cards now costs less than 
$10, I highly recommend to just get a NIC card for each MASQed network segment.
</para>

<para>
Users should also understand that IP Masquerading will only work with a physical 
interface such as eth0, eth1, etc.  MASQing out an aliased interface such as 
"eth0:1, eth1:1, etc" will NOT work.  In other words, the following WILL NOT 
WORK reliably:

<para>
It is rumored that you can simply use the destination IP address (the IP

</para>

<para>
If you are still interested in using aliased interfaces, you need to enable 
the "IP Alias" feature in the kernel.  You will then need to re-compile and 
reboot.   Once running the new kernel, you need to configure Linux to use the 
new interface (i.e. eth0:1, etc.).  After that, you can treat it as a 
normal Ethernet interface with some restrictions like the one above.

<Title>( ACCOUNTING ) -  I need to do accounting on who is using the network</Title>

<para>
Though this doesn't have much to do with IPMASQ, here are a few ideas.  If you 
know of a better solution, please email the author of this HOWTO so it can be 
added to the HOWTO.
</para>

<para>

<ItemizedList>

<listitem>
<para>
Idea #1:  You could run the command:
<screen>
IPCHAINS: "ipchains -L -M" 

IPTABLES: "cat /proc/net/ip_conntrack"

IPFWADM:
</screen>
once a second and log all of those entries.  You could then write a program 
to merge this information into one large file.  Again, this will only 
provide you with the remote IP address and nothing about the content viewed 
or downloaded.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Idea #2:  Log every packet:  You can match any specific traffic flows but
this method will create VERY LARGE log files.  Unfortunately, these log files 
aren't very readable and it doesn't tell you what was transfered (FTP files,
etc.).  Fortunately, setting up this form of accounting is easy.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Idea #3:  Say you want to log all traffic going out onto the internet.  You 
can setup a firewall rule to accept port 80 traffic with with the SYN bit set 
and log it.  Now mind you, this will create smaller log files than the idea
above but you will only know the destination IP address and NOT the WWW pages 
viewed.
</para>
</listitem>


<listitem>
 <para>
 Idea #4:  Transparent Proxy:  This method really doesn't use IPMASQ since it 
 requires the installation and setup of the Squid HTTP/FTP proxy server.
 The benefit of this method is that internal users won't notice anything
 different in terms of connectivity but now the SysAdmin gets a LOT more 
 information (files downloaded, etc).  But, there are pros/cons to setting this
 up:
 </para>

 <para>
 Pro:
 </para>
 <ItemizedList>
  <listitem>
   <para>
   + full logging of all transferred files and issues FTP commands
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
   + you can enable caching on the proxy server.  With caching, you can save
     bandwidth since once a file is downloaded, any identical file
     requests will be served via the cache and not redownloaded via
     the Internet connection.
   </para>
  </listitem>

 <para>
 Con:

<Sect1 id="multiple-ips">
<Title>( MULTIPLE IPs - DMZ segments) -  I have several EXTERNAL IP addresses that I want to
PORTFW to several internal machines.  How do I do this?</Title>

<para>
You DON'T do this with MASQ.  
</para>

<para>
MASQ is a 1:Many NAT setup which is the incorrect tool to perform what you are 
looking for.  You are looking for is either Many:Many NAT solution or a Briding
setup.  
</para>

<para>
<Emphasis role="strong">NOTE: </Emphasis>For users out there who are thinking 
about enabling multiple IP addresses on one internal NIC using "IP Alias" and 
then just PORTFWeding ALL of those ports (0-65535), and and finally use 
IPROUTE2 to maintain the proper source/destination IP pairs.  This has been 
done SUCCESSFULLY on 2.0.x kernels and less successfully on 2.2.x kernels.  
Regardless of success, that isn't the proper way to do it, it's a total HACK, 
and it is not a supported MASQ configuration.  Please, give IPTABLES on the 
2.4.x kernels a serious look or to a much lesser extent, 
<XRef LinkEnd="shaping"> IPROUTE2 look for 2.2.x kernels.

<para>
Anyway, for forwarding external IP address to internal hosts, you basically
have three possibilites:

<ItemizedList>
  <listitem>
   <para>
<screen>
1. Route the external IPs 

   (This does NOT involve IPMASQ at all but requires special WAN addressing 
    and routing setup from your ISP):

    Internet -- Some public WAN -- Linux -- DMZ segment
                   IP address      Server     PUBLIC IPs
                                     |
                                     +------ Internal net
                                              private IPs
</screen>
   </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>
<screen>
2. 1:1 NAT 

   (Most easily done via IPTABLES or with IPCHAINS and IPROUTE2 but still 
    some protocols cannot deal with NAT)

    Internet -- Linux -- DMZ segment
                Server     Private IPs natted to 1:1 PUBLIC IPs
                   |
                   +------ Internal net
                            private IPs

</screen>
   </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>
<screen>
3. Bridging:  

   This is how most commercial firewalls do it as it's very slick.  Basically, 
   all public IPs transparently flow through the Linux server to the DMZ but 
   via firewall inspection.

    Internet -- Linux -- DMZ segment
                Server     PUBLIC IPs
                  |
                  +------ Internal net
                           private IPs

</screen>
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </ItemizedList>
</para>

<para>
Each of these solutions have pros and cons
</para>
<para>
Item #1: If you're lucky enough to have an ISP that will set this up for you
(pretty rare), all you need to do is use basic 'route' commands to get this 
running.  This is the most rebust solution and doesn't require any form of 
IPMASQ or NAT to work.
</para>
<para>
Item #2:  1:1 NAT isn't covered in this HOWTO yet but if you need a hand, just 
email me and I'll give you a hand.  
</para>
<para>

<para>
There might be a problem with the "netstat" program in 2.0.x-based Linux 
distros.  After a Linux reboot, running "netstat -M" works fine but after a 
MASQed computer runs some successful ICMP traffic like ping, traceroute, 
etc., you might see something like:
</para>

<para>
masq_info.c: Internal Error `ip_masquerade unknown type'.

2.4.x kernels currently have a PPTP module now in the newest versions of
the IPTABLES program and there is another version available on the IPMASQ WWW

<ItemizedList>
<listitem>

<para>
Sendmail:  Enable specific relaying for your internal MASQed machines by editing 
the /etc/sendmail.cw file and add the hostname and domain name of your internal 
MASQed machine.  You should also check to see that the /etc/hosts file has the 
IP address and Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) configured in it.  Once this

files.  This is covered in

</para>

<para>
POP-3:  Some users configure their internal MASQ'ed computer's POP-3 clients to 
connect to some external SMTP server.  While this is fine, many SMTP servers 
out there will try to IDENT your connection on port 113.  Most likely your 
problem stems around your default Masquerade policy being set to DENY.  This is 
BAD.  Set it to REJECT and re-run your rc.firewall ruleset.
</para>

<Sect1 id="iproute2">
<Title>( Source Routing ) - I need different internal MASQed networks to exit 
on different external IP addresses</Title>

<para>
Say you have the following setup:  You have multiple internal networks and also 
multiple external IP addresses and/or networks.  What you want to do is have 
LAN #1 to only use External IP #1 but you wan LAN #2 to use External IP #2.
</para>

<para>
Internal LAN ----------&#62; official IP
</para>

<para>
LAN #1                 External IP #1
192.168.0.x      --&#62;     123.123.123.11
</para>

<para>
LAN #2                 External IP #2
192.168.1.x      --&#62;     123.123.123.12
</para>

<para>
Basically, what we have described here is routing NOT only on the destination 
address (typical IP routing) but also routing based upon the SOURCE address 
as well.  This is typically called "policy-based routing" or "source routing".  
This functionality is NOT available in 2.0.x kernels, it *IS* available for 
2.2.x kernels via the IPROUTE2 package, and it is built into the new 2.4.x 
kernels using IPTABLES.
</para>

<para>
First, you have to understand that both IPFWADM and IPCHAINS get involved 
*AFTER* the routing system has decided where to send a given packet.  This 
statement really ought to be stamped in big red letters on all 
IPFWADM/IPCHAINS/IPMASQ documentation.  The reason for this is that users 
MUST first have their routing setup correct, then start adding 
IPFWADM/IPCHAINS and/or Masq features.  
</para>

<para>
Anyways, for the example case shown above, you will need to persuade the routing 
system to direct packets from 192.168.0.x via 123.123.1233.11 and packets from 
192.168.1.x via 123.123.123.12.  That is the hardest part and adding Masq on 
top of correct routing is easy.
</para>

<para>
To do this fancy routing, you will use IPROUTE2.  Because this functionality has 
NOTHING to do with IPMASQ, this HOWTO does not cover this topic in great detail.  
Please see <XRef LinkEnd="kernel-2.2.x-Requirements"> for complete URLs and 
documentation for this topic.
</para>

<para>
The "iprule" and "iproute" commands are the same as "ip rule" and "ip route" 
commands (I prefer the former since it is easier to search for.)  All the 
commands below are completely untested, if they do not work, please let 
David Ranch know about it but please contact the IPROUTE2 email list for 
help.  This function has NOTHING to do with IP Masquerading.

 iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $EXTIF -s $INTNET2 -j SNAT --to $EXTIP2
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
2.2.x. kernels:  
</para>

<para>
The first few commands only need to be done once at boot, say in 
/etc/rc.d/rc.local file.
</para>

<para>

<Screen>

# Allow internal LANs to route to each other, no masq.
  /sbin/iprule add from 192.168.0.0/16 to 192.168.0.0/16 table main pref 100
# All other traffic from 192.168.1.x is external, handle by table 101
  /sbin/iprule add from 192.168.1.0/24 to 0/0 table 101 pref 102
# All other traffic from 192.168.2.x is external, handle by table 102
  /sbin/iprule add from 192.168.2.0/24 to 0/0 table 102 pref 102

These commands need to be issued when eth0 is configured, perhaps in 
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-post (for Redhat systems).  Be sure to
do them by hand first to make sure they work.

# Table 101 forces all assigned packets out via 123.123.123.11
  /sbin/iproute add table 101 via 123.123.123.11
# Table 102 forces all assigned packets out via 123.123.123.12
  /sbin/iproute add table 102 via 123.123.123.12

At this stage, you should find that packets from 192.168.1.x to the
outside world are being routed via 123.123.123.11, packets from
192.168.2.x are routed via 123.123.123.12.

It is IMPORTANT that these IPROUTE2 rules be run /BEFORE/ the rc.firewall
ruleset is run.  

If everything hangs together, the masq code will see packets being
routed out on 123.123.123.11 and 123.123.123.12 and will use those addresses
as the masq source address.

So why can't you run IPCHAINS MASQ/PORTFW functionality with a 2.4.x kernel?  
Once the IPCHAINS module is loaded, you CANNOT use any IPTABLES commands or 
modules since the code conflicts.  In addition to this, you cannot use any 
legacy 2.2.x IPCHAINS masq modules on a 2.4.x kernel as the kernels are so 
radically different.  Plus, this really shouldn't be an issue as all of this 
functionality is available via native IPTABLES modules now.  Finally, you 
cannot use the IPMASQADM tool with a 2.4.x kernel as the program both won't 
compile and ultimately the PORTFW kernel handlers aren't present anymore (it's 
now done natively by the IPTABLES code).  So, considering all of these facts:

Make sure the language you want to translate to is not already covered by

<para>
Yes, this HOWTO is still being maintained.  In the past, Ambrose was guilty of 
being too busy working on two jobs and didn't have much time to work on this, 
my apologies.  As of v1.50, David Ranch revamped the document and got it current 
again.

If you think of a topic that could be included in the HOWTO, please send email 
<ULink URL="mailto:dranch@trinnet.net">dranch@trinnet.net</ULink>.  It will be 
even better if you can provide that information.  We will then include the 
information into the HOWTO once it is both found appropriate and tested.  
Many thanks for your contributions!
</para>

<para>
We have a lot of new ideas and plans for improving the HOWTO, such as case 
studies that will cover different network setup involving IP Masquerade, more on 
security via strong IPFWADM/IPCHAINS firewall rulesets, IPCHAINS usage, more 
FAQ entries, etc.  If you think you can help, please do!  Thanks.

   12/19/03: Updated the rc.firewall-2.4-stronger ruleset to 0.82.  This
new ruleset has a special ICMP filter to work around a Netfilter bug. 
Also, the drop-and-log-it chain has been renamed to reject-and-log-it 
since that's actually what it's doing.  Thanks to Bart Martens for the
recommendations.

   11/30/03: Updated the rc.firewall-2.4-stronger ruleset to 0.81s, the
rc-firewall-2.2-stronger ruleset to 0.72s, and updated the
rc.firewall-2.0-stronger ruleset to 0.72s (never had a version # before).
These changes reflect either the ruleset not having strong enough comments
or allowing all traffic destined to the MASQ server itself from being
protected.  It's recommend that if you want to enable access to servers running
on the MASQ server itself (http, ssh, etc.), selectively enable them under the 
OPTIONAL INPUT section.
