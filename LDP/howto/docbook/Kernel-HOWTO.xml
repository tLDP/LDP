        It is the usual industry practice to have a debug PC box, a test PC 
        box, and a production PC box. Nobody works directly on a production 
        box without experimenting first on debug PC and test PC. This is 
        because the skills of a person varies and every person needs a warm-up 
        exercise before doing the final show. A computer hardware is a very 
        sophisticated technology like "Space Shuttle" and risks are involved 
        as it can fail unexpectedly. Eventhough efforts are made to ensure 
        that this document is upto-date and all commands are pre-tested, it is 
        strongly recommended that you should practice your skills first on a 
        trainer test PC before you do anything to "LIVE" production box. You 
        will sharpen your skills and hone your knowledge first on a test PC 
        running Linux and after everything works, then change the production 
        box with extreme caution. Even if you break the test PC with dangerous 
        commands you will learn by doing mistakes and you can afford breaking 
        the test PC. You will be more confident working first on Test PC. Most 
        companies purchase old PCs for using them as "Trainer Machines". 
        Please understand that there is no warranty or guaranty on this 
        document and you can build your own warranty by checking this document 
        with your test PC or your home PC (low risk environments). (Write your 
        own warranty document and hang it on wall near your computer!!)

        Before you build kernel, it is a good idea to do a backup of the 
        system. If you had not backed up your system recently then you can do 
        it now. You can use commercial backup tools like 
        <ulink url="http://24.221.230.253">
          BRS Backup-Recovery-Software 
        </ulink>
        (also in this page you can find open-source/freeware backup tools 
        listed under 'Backup and Restore Utility'). Backup is just a 
        suggestion and it is not mandatory to do backup before building the 
        Linux kernel.

        Minor Upgrading of Kernel 
      </title>
      <para>
        If you had already built the kernel and you want to upgrade to next 
        patch release, then you can simply copy the existing config file and 
        reuse it. (For example you have built kernel 2.4.19 and want to 
        upgrade to 2.4.20). 
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis remap="bf">
          For minor upgrades : 
        </emphasis>
        This step may save you time, if you want to reuse the old settings. 
        Whenever you install the kernel, generally you put the config file in 
        /boot. Do not save the .config as .config.save because 'make mrproper' 
        will wipe out all .config* files!! So, you can use the existing 
        version of config file: 
        <programlisting format="linespecific">
	bash# mkdir /usr/src/kernelconfigs 
	bash# cp /usr/src/linux/.config  /usr/src/kernelconfigs/.config.save
	bash# cp /usr/src/linux/.config  /usr/src/linux/configs/.config.save  # ExtraSafe
	bash# cp /boot/config*  /usr/src/linux/configs/  # ExtraSafe
	bash# cp /boot/config-2.4.18-19.8.0  /usr/src/linux/.config
        </programlisting>
        Or another method is - you can copy the .config file from your old 
        linux kernel source tree to new kernel tree. 
        <programlisting format="linespecific">
	bash# ls -l /usr/src/lin*  # You can see that /usr/src/linux is a soft link
	bash# cd /usr/src/linux 
	bash# cp ../linux-old-tree/.config .  # Example cp ../linux-2.4.19/.config .
        </programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
        or one other method is - you can use "make oldconfig" which default 
        all questions based on the contents of your existing ./.config file. 
      </para>
      <para>
        NOTE: If you do not have lot of disk space in /usr/src then you can 
        unpack the kernel source package on any partition where you have free 
        disk space (like /home). Because kernel compile needs lot of disk 
        space for object files like *.o. For this reason the /usr/src/linux 
        MUST be a soft link pointing to your source directory.

        kernel versions like 2.2, 2.0 and 1.3. It should also work for future 
        or newer versions of kernel (with little changes - let me know).

              are located in /usr/src/linux/configs/kernel-*.config which you

      Loadable Modules 
    </title>
    <para>
      Everyone who used 'Loadable Modules' really "loves" them!! I like the 
      Loadable Modules, they are really cute and they break up a large task 
      into tiny manageable pieces. When you start using them, I can bet that 
      you will fall in love them! Loadable Module is peculiar only to Linux. 
      Linux is the first operating system in the world to introduce the 
      concept of Loadable Module. No other operating system has this concept, 
      but in near future other operating systems may implement this. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Loadable kernel modules can save memory and ease configuration. The 
      scope of modules has grown to include filesystems, ethernet card 
      drivers, tape drivers, printer drivers, and more. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Loadable modules are pieces of kernel code which are not linked 
      (included) directly in the kernel. One compiles them separately, and can 
      insert and remove them into the running kernel at almost any time. Due 
      to its flexibility, this is now the preferred way to code certain kernel 
      features. Many popular device drivers, such as the PCMCIA drivers and 
      the QIC-80/40 tape driver, are loadable modules.

        Modules distributed with the kernel

      <para>
        As of version 2.0.30, most of everything is available as a loadable 
        modules. To use them, first make sure that you don't configure them 
        into the regular kernel; that is, don't say 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          y 
        </literal>
        to it during ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          make config 
        </literal>
        '. Compile a new kernel and reboot with it. Then, 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          cd 
        </literal>
        to 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          /usr/src/linux 
        </literal>
        again, and do a ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          make modules 
        </literal>
        '. This compiles all of the modules which you did not specify in the 
        kernel configuration, and places links to them in 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          /usr/src/linux/modules 
        </literal>
        . You can use them straight from that directory or execute ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          make modules_install 
        </literal>
        ', which installs them in 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          /lib/modules/x.y.z

        This can be especially handy with filesystems. You may not use the 
        minix or msdos filesystems frequently. For example, if I encountered 
        an msdos (shudder) floppy, I would 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          insmod /usr/src/linux/modules/msdos.o

        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          rmmod msdos 
        </literal>
        when finished. This procedure saves about 50k of RAM in the kernel 
        during normal operation. A small note is in order for the minix 
        filesystem: you should 
        <emphasis remap="it">

        configure it directly into the kernel for use in ``rescue'' disks.

        Howto Install Just A Single Module ? 
      </title>
      <para>
        Let us assume that you already did 'make modules' and 'make 
        modules_install'. And later you did 'make clean' to free up disk 
        space. And now, you want to change a "C" file in one of the modules 
        and want to rebuild just that module and copy the module file to 
        /lib/modules. How do you do it? And, you do not want to give 'make 
        modules' as that will rebuild everything and will take about 2 to 3 
        hours! 
      </para>
      <para>
        You can compile just a single module file (say like foo.o) and install 
        it. For this simply edit the Makefile and change the SUBDIRS to add 
        only those directories you are interested. 
      </para>
      <para>
        A good example is - I found that my default kernel did not include the 
        NTFS filesystem support (I did make clean after make modules. Darn and 
        Damn it!). So, I decided to compile the loadable module of NTFS. I did 
        not want to compile the whole set (as it will take me about 2 hours), 
        so I followed the procedure below and compiled just the fs/ntfs and 
        did 'insmod ntfs'. It just took me about 5 minutes!! 
      </para>
      <para>
        Another example: If I am interested in installing only fs/autofs 
        module, then I do the following : 
        <programlisting format="linespecific">
	cd /usr/src/linux
	mv Makefile Makefile.original
	cp Makefile.original Makefile.my
	ln -s Makefile.my Makefile   # Because some files underneath still need "Makefile"
	vi Makefile.my
	# And comment out the line having 'SUBDIRS' and add the 
	# directory you are interested, for example like fs/autofs as below :
		#SUBDIRS	=kernel drivers mm fs net ipc lib abi crypto
		SUBDIRS		=fs/autofs
	# Save the file Makefile.my and give -
	make -f Makefile.my modules
	# This will create module autofs.o
	# Now, copy the module object file to destination /lib/modules
	# DANGER: Do NOT DO THIS - "make -f Makefile.my modules_install" This may
	# clean up other good ones in /lib/modules !! But just copy as below:
	cp autofs.o /lib/modules/2.4.18-19.8.0/kernel/fs/autofs
	  
	# Now, reset everything back to normal
	rm Makefile  # This is a link to Makefile.my
	ln -s Makefile.original Makefile
	  
	# Record your changes to the config file for future use
	# Edit the /usr/src/linux/.config file and set the item as module
	cd /usr/src/linux
    mkdir /usr/src/kernelconfigs ;
    cp /usr/src/linux/.config  /usr/src/kernelconfigs/.config.save;
	cp /usr/src/linux/.config  /usr/src/linux/configs/.config.save  # ExtraSafe
	cp /boot/config*  /usr/src/linux/configs/  # ExtraSafe
	vi /usr/src/linux/.config 
	# And change the config parameter. For example in case of my
	# ntfs module I did CONFIG_NTFS_FS=m  to indicate as module.

        What does the kernel do, anyway? 
      </title>
      <para>
        The Unix kernel acts as a mediator for your programs and your 
        hardware. First, it does (or arranges for) the memory management for 
        all of the running programs (processes), and makes sure that they all 
        get a fair (or unfair, if you please) share of the processor's cycles. 
        In addition, it provides a nice, fairly portable interface for 
        programs to talk to your hardware. 
      </para>
      <para>
        There is certainly more to the kernel's operation than this, but these 
        basic functions are the most important to know.

      <title>
        Why would I want to upgrade my kernel? 
      </title>
      <para>
        Newer kernels generally offer the ability to talk to more types of 
        hardware (that is, they have more device drivers), they can have 
        better process management, they can run faster than the older 
        versions, they could be more stable than the older versions, and they 
        fix silly bugs in the older versions. Most people upgrade kernels 
        because they want the device drivers and the bug fixes.

        What kind of hardware do the newer kernels support?

        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          config.in 
        </literal>
        ' file in the linux source, or just find out when you try ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          make config 
        </literal>
        '. This shows you all hardware supported by the standard kernel 
        distribution, but not everything that linux supports; many common 
        device drivers (such as the PCMCIA drivers and some tape drivers) are 
        loadable modules maintained and distributed separately.

        What version of gcc and libc do I need? 
      </title>
      <para>
        Linus recommends a version of gcc in the 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          README 
        </literal>
        file included with the linux source. If you don't have this version, 
        the documentation in the recommended version of gcc should tell you if 
        you need to upgrade your libc. This is not a difficult procedure, but 
        it is important to follow the instructions.

        How much disk space do I need?

      <para>
        It depends on your particular system configuration. First, the 
        compressed linux source is nearly 14 megabytes large at version 2.2.9. 
        Many sites keep this even after unpacking. Uncompressed and built with 
        a moderate configuration, it takes up another 67 MB.

        How long does it take?

      <para>
        With newer machines, the compilation takes dramatically less time than 
        older ones; an AMD K6-2/300 with a fast disk can do a 2.2.x kernel in 
        about four minutes. As for old Pentiums, 486s, and 386s, if you plan 
        to compile one, be prepared to wait, possibly hours, days.. 
      </para>
      <para>
        If this troubles you, and you happen to have a faster machine around 
        to compile on, you can build on the fast machines (assuming you give 
        it the right parameters, that your ulilities are up-to-date, and so 
        on), and then transfer the kernel image to the slower machine.

        Applying a patch

      <para>
        Incremental upgrades of the kernel are distributed as patches. For 
        example, if you have Linux v1.1.45, and you notice that there's a ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          patch46.gz 
        </literal>
        ' out there for it, it means you can upgrade to version 1.1.46 through 
        application of the patch. You might want to make a backup of the 
        source tree first (` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          make clean 
        </literal>
        ' and then ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          cd /usr/src; tar zcvf old-tree.tar.gz linux 
        </literal>
        ' will make a compressed tar archive for you.). 
      </para>
      <para>
        So, continuing with the example above, let's suppose that you have ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          patch46.gz 
        </literal>
        ' in 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          /usr/src

        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">

        to 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          /usr/src 
        </literal>
        and do a ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          zcat patch46.gz [verbar] patch -p0 
        </literal>

        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          patch -p0 [lt ] patch46 
        </literal>
        ' if the patch isn't compressed). You'll see things whizz by (or 
        flutter by, if your system is that slow) telling you that it is trying 
        to apply hunks, and whether it succeeds or not. Usually, this action 
        goes by too quickly for you to read, and you're not too sure whether 
        it worked or not, so you might want to use the 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          -s 
        </literal>
        flag to 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          patch 
        </literal>
        , which tells 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          patch 
        </literal>
        to only report error messages (you don't get as much of the ``hey, my 
        computer is actually doing something for a change!'' feeling, but you 
        may prefer this..). To look for parts which might not have gone 
        smoothly, cd to 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          /usr/src/linux 
        </literal>
        and look for files with a 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          .rej 
        </literal>
        extension. Some versions of 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          patch 
        </literal>
        (older versions which may have been compiled with on an inferior 
        filesystem) leave the rejects with a 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          # 
        </literal>

        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          find 
        </literal>
        ' to look for you; find . -name '*.rej' -print prints all files who

        If everything went right, do a `

        will suppress all messages except the errors. If you keep your kernel

      <para>
        The most frequent problem that used to arise was when a patch modified 
        a file called ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          config.in 
        </literal>
        ' and it didn't look quite right, because you changed the options to 
        suit your machine. This has been taken care of, but one still might 
        encounter it with an older release. To fix it, look at the 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          config.in.rej 
        </literal>
        file, and see what remains of the original patch. The changes will 
        typically be marked with ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          + 
        </literal>
        ' and ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          - 
        </literal>
        ' at the beginning of the line. Look at the lines surrounding it, and 
        remember if they were set to ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          y 
        </literal>
        ' or ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          n 
        </literal>
        '. Now, edit 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          config.in 
        </literal>
        , and change ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          y 
        </literal>
        ' to ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          n 
        </literal>
        ' and ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          n 
        </literal>
        ' to ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          y 
        </literal>
        ' when appropriate. Do a patch -p0 &lt; config.in.rej and if it 
        reports that it succeeded (no fails), then you can continue on with a 
        configuration and compilation. The 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          config.in.rej 
        </literal>
        file will remain, but you can get delete it. 
      </para>
      <para>
        If you encounter further problems, you might have installed a patch 
        out of order. If patch says ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          previously applied patch detected: Assume -R? 
        </literal>
        ', you are probably trying to apply a patch which is below your 
        current version number; if you answer ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          y 
        </literal>
        ', it will attempt to degrade your source, and will most likely fail; 
        thus, you will need to get a whole new source tree (which might not 
        have been such a bad idea in the first place). 
      </para>
      <para>
        To back out (unapply) a patch, use ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          patch -R 
        </literal>
        ' on the original patch.

      <para>
        The best thing to do when patches really turn out wrong is to start 
        over again with a clean, out-of-the-box source tree (for example, from 
        one of the 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          linux-x.y.z.tar.gz 
        </literal>
        files), and start again.

        files will start to pile up. For example, one 1.1.51 tree I had was

        Other patches 
      </title>
      <para>
        There are other patches (I'll call them ``nonstandard'') than the ones 
        Linus distributes. If you apply these, Linus' patches may not work 
        correctly and you'll have to either back them out, fix the source or 
        the patch, install a new source tree, or a combination of the above. 
        This can become very frustrating, so if you do not want to modify the 
        source (with the possibility of a very bad outcome), back out the 
        nonstandard patches before applying Linus', or just install a new 
        tree. Then, you can see if the nonstandard patches still work. If they 
        don't, you are either stuck with an old kernel, playing with the patch 
        or source to get it to work, or waiting (possibly begging) for a new 
        version of the patch to come out. 
      </para>
      <para>
        How common are the patches not in the standard distribution? You will 
        probably hear of them. I used to use the noblink patch for my virtual 
        consoles because I hate blinking cursors (This patch is (or at least 
        was) frequently updated for new kernel releases.). With most newer 
        device drivers being developed as loadable modules, though, the 
        frequecy of ``nonstandard'' patches is decreasing significantly.

        Conditional kernel install 
      </title>
      <para>
        Other than using floppy disks, there are several methods of testing 
        out a new kernel without touching the old one. Unlike many other Unix 
        flavors, LILO has the ability to boot a kernel from anywhere on the 
        disk (if you have a large (500 MB or above) disk, please read over the 
        LILO documentation on how this may cause problems). So, if you add 
        something similar to image = /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage 
        label = new_kernel to the end of your LILO configuration file, you can 
        choose to run a newly compiled kernel without touching your old 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          /vmlinuz 
        </literal>
        (after running 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          lilo 
        </literal>
        , of course). The easiest way to tell LILO to boot a new kernel is to 
        press the shift key at bootup time (when it says 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          LILO 
        </literal>
        on the screen, and nothing else), which gives you a prompt. At this 
        point, you can enter ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          new_kernel 
        </literal>
        ' to boot the new kernel.

          ln -sf linux-1.2.2 /usr/src/linux

        like this, make certain that the last argument to 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          ln 
        </literal>
        is not a real directory (old symbolic links are fine); the result will

      Mount RPMs With FTPFS 
    </title>
    <para>
      By this time, your kernel is compiled and running ok. You will have the 
      need to access countless number of RPMs which you may need to install in 
      near future. One way is to physically mount the Linux CDROMS, but there 
      are more than 3 Linux cdroms and it is cumbersome to remove and change 
      the Linux cdroms. Hence, here comes the FTPFS. 
    </para>
    <para>
      If you want to automate the installing of RPMs, then consider the 
      'apt-get' command. The apt-get automatically detects all the 
      dependencies and downloads and installs or upgrades the packages 
      automatically. See the section "Install, Update at Speed of Light" in 
      <xref linkend="apt-get"/>

      FTP File System is a Linux kernel module, enhancing the VFS with FTP 
      volume mounting capabilities. That is, you can "mount" FTP shared 
      directories in your very personal file system and take advantage of 
      local files ops. It is at

          The autofs way - A must try!

        <para>
          If you were wise enough to install the autofs/automount bridge 
          (check out the installation notes) there is a cool way to use ftpfs: 
          just try to access any file/dir on the desired server under 
          /mnt/ftpfs. 
          <programlisting format="linespecific">
	cd /mnt/ftpfs/[user:pass@]ftp_server[:port]
          </programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>
          Something like cd /mnt/ftpfs/ftp.kernel.org. And guess what? You're 
          there! 
        </para>
        <para>
          Normally you will only use this for anonymous ftp since you don't 
          want your user/pass info to show up in the /mnt/ftpfs/ tree.

	The parameters: [defaults]
	    * user: The user to be used for logging on the FTP server. [anonymous]
	    * password: The password for that user. [user@ftpfs.sourceforge.net]
	    * hostname: The FTP server.
	    * port: The port the server is listening on. [21]
	    * root_dir: The directory on the FTP server you want to be mounted. This should be specified without the trailing slash (that is "/home/duru", not "/home/duru/"). [/]
	    * mount_point: The local directory you want to mount the FTP server onto.
	    * own: Flag to force ownership on all remote files. Useful for FTP servers that list user IDs instead of user names.
	    * uid: The local user ID you want to be the owner of the mounted tree.
	    * gid: The local group ID you want to own the mounted tree.
	    * fmask: The numeric mode to be ORed on all mounted files.
	    * dmask: The numeric mode to be ORed on all mounted dirs.
	    * active: Flag to enable active mode for FTP transfers. Useful if you're behind some firewall and cannot connect to random ports.

          If for some reason you choose not to use ftpmount (you probably 
          installed the kernel patch and are too lazy to install ftpmount 
          too), here's the way to use good-ol mount:

          <emphasis remap="bf">
            mount -n -t ftpfs none mount_point -o ip=server_ip [lsqb

        <para>
          Please note that you have to provide the server's IP and that the 
          only way to enter a password is in clear. For example, while 
          testing, I used the following command: 
        </para>
        <para>
          mount -n -t ftpfs none /mnt/ftpfs -o

        </para>
        <para>
          The own option (-o for ftpmount) forces ownership by the mounting 
          user on all files. This is useful for accommodating servers with 
          strange user/permissions management (SERVU &amp; stuff).

                It works best for one process! While concurrent access (under 
                normal circumstances) shouldn't cause any problem, the output 
                is optimized for one process reading (the TCP connection is 
                kept alive). So, if you're gonna watch a movie, you don't want 
                other processes to access the mount point and kill the 
                throughoutput (trust me!).

      Kernel Files Information

      This section gives a "very brief" and "introduction" to some of the 
      Linux Kernel System. If you have time you can give one reading.

        vmlinuz and vmlinux 
      </title>
      <para>
        The "vm" stands for "Virtual Memory". Linux supports virtual memory 
        unlike old operating systems like DOS which have a hard limit of 640KB 
        memory. Linux can use the hard disk space as "virtual memory" and 
        hence the name "vm". The vmlinuz is the Linux kernel executable. This 
        is located at /boot/vmlinuz. This can be a soft link to something like 
        /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.18-19.8.0. The vmlinuz is created by "make zImage" 
        and you do "cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/linux/boot/zImage 
        /boot/vmlinuz". The vmlinuz is a compressed file of vmlinux. The 
        zImage is there for backward compatibility (smaller kernels). Note 
        that, in near future zImage may be dropped in favor of 'make bzImage' 
        (big zImage). The zImage (vmlinuz) is not just a compressed image, but 
        has gzip decompressor code built into it as well (at the beginning). 
        So you cannot use gunzip or gzip -dc to unpack vmlinuz. 
      </para>
      <para>
        Both zImage and bzImage are compressed with gzip. The kernel includes 
        a mini-gunzip to uncompress the kernel and boot into it. The 
        difference is that the old zImage uncompresses the kernel into low 
        memory (the first 640k), and bzImage uncompresses the kernel into high 
        memory (over 1M). 
      </para>
      <para>
        The vmlinux is the uncompressed built kernel, vmlinuz is the 
        compressed one, that has been made bootable. (Note both names vmlinux 
        and vmlinuz look same except for last letter z). Generally, you don't 
        need to worry about vmlinux, it is just an intermediate step. 
      </para>
      <para>
        The kernel usually makes a bzImage, and stores it in arch/i386/boot, 
        and it is up to the user to copy it to /boot and configure GRUB or 
        LILO.

        The bzImage is the compressed kernel image created with command 'make 
        bzImage' during kernel compile. It important to note that bzImage is 
        not compressed with 
        <emphasis remap="bf">
          bzip2 
        </emphasis>
        !! The name bz in bzImage is misleading!! It stands for "Big Zimage". 
        The "b" in bzImage is "big". Both zImage and bzImage are compressed 
        with gzip. The kernel includes a mini-gunzip to uncompress the kernel 
        and boot into it. The difference is that the old zImage uncompresses 
        the kernel into low memory (the first 640k), and bzImage uncompresses 
        the kernel into high memory (over 1M). The only problem is that there 
        are a very few machines where bzImage is known to have problems 
        (because the machines are buggy). The bzImage actually boots faster, 
        but other than that, there's no difference in the way the system 
        *runs*. The rule is that if all drivers cannot fit into the zImage, 
        then you need to modularize more. 
      </para>
      <para>
        If the kernel is small, it will work as both a zImage and a bzImage, 
        and the booted system runs the same way. A big kernel will work as a 
        bzImage, but not as a zImage. Both bootimages are gzipped, (bzImage is 
        not bzipped as the name would suggest), but are put together and 
        loaded differently, that allows the kernel to load in higher address 
        space, that does not limit it to lower memory in the pathetic intel 
        architecture. So why have both? Backward compatability. Some older 
        lilos and loadlins don't handle the bzImage format. Note, they *boot* 
        differently, but *run* the same. There is a lot of misinformation 
        given out about what a bzImage file is (mostly about it being 
        bzip2ed).

        <para>
          In the context of programming, a symbol is the building block of a 
          program: it is a variable name or a function name. It should be of 
          no surprise that the kernel has symbols, just like the programs you 
          write. The difference is, of course, that the kernel is a very 
          complicated piece of coding and has many, many global symbols.

          What Is The Kernel Symbol Table? 
        </title>
        <para>
          The kernel doesn't use symbol names. It's much happier knowing a 
          variable or function name by the variable or function's address. 
          Rather than using size_t BytesRead, the kernel prefers to refer to 
          this variable as (for example) c0343f20. 
        </para>
        <para>
          Humans, on the other hand, do not appreciate names like c0343f20. We 
          prefer to use something like size_t BytesRead. Normally, this 
          doesn't present much of a problem. The kernel is mainly written in 
          C, so the compiler/linker allows us to use symbol names when we code 
          and allows the kernel to use addresses when it runs. Everyone is 
          happy. 
        </para>
        <para>
          There are situations, however, where we need to know the address of 
          a symbol (or the symbol for an address). This is done by a symbol 
          table, and is very similar to how gdb can give you the function name 
          from a address (or an address from a function name). A symbol table 
          is a listing of all symbols along with their address. Here is an 
          example of a symbol table:

          What Is The System.map File?

          Every time you compile a new kernel, the addresses of various symbol 
          names are bound to change. 
        </para>
        <para>
          /proc/ksyms is a "proc file" and is created on the fly when a kernel 
          boots up. Actually, it's not really a file; it's simply a 
          representation of kernel data which is given the illusion of being a 
          disk file. If you don't believe me, try finding the filesize of 
          /proc/ksyms. Therefore, it will always be correct for the kernel 
          that is currently running.. 
        </para>
        <para>
          However, System.map is an actual file on your filesystem. When you 
          compile a new kernel, your old System.map has wrong symbol 
          information. A new System.map is generated with each kernel compile 
          and you need to replace the old copy with your new copy.

          What Is An Oops? 
        </title>
        <para>
          What is the most common bug in your homebrewed programs? The 
          segfault. Good ol' signal 11. 
        </para>
        <para>
          What is the most common bug in the Linux kernel? The segfault. 
          Except here, the notion of a segfault is much more complicated and 
          can be, as you can imagine, much more serious. When the kernel 
          dereferences an invalid pointer, it's not called a segfault -- it's 
          called an "oops". An oops indicates a kernel bug and should always 
          be reported and fixed. 
        </para>
        <para>
          Note that an oops is not the same thing as a segfault. Your program 
          cannot recover from a segfault. The kernel doesn't necessarily have 
          to be in an unstable state when an oops occurs. The Linux kernel is 
          very robust; the oops may just kill the current process and leave 
          the rest of the kernel in a good, solid state. 
        </para>
        <para>
          An oops is not a kernel panic. In a panic, the kernel cannot 
          continue; the system grinds to a halt and must be restarted. An oops 
          may cause a panic if a vital part of the system is destroyed. An 
          oops in a device driver, for example, will almost never cause a 
          panic. 
        </para>
        <para>
          When an oops occurs, the system will print out information that is 
          relevent to debugging the problem, like the contents of all the CPU 
          registers, and the location of page descriptor tables. In 
          particular, the contents of the EIP (instruction pointer) is 
          printed. Like this: 
          <programlisting format="linespecific">
	   EIP: 0010:[&lt;00000000&gt;]
	   Call Trace: [&lt;c010b860&gt;]

          What Does An Oops Have To Do With System.map? 
        </title>
        <para>
          You can agree that the information given in EIP and Call Trace is 
          not very informative. But more importantly, it's really not 
          informative to a kernel developer either. Since a symbol doesn't 
          have a fixed address, c010b860 can point anywhere. 
        </para>
        <para>
          To help us use this cryptic oops output, Linux uses a daemon called 
          klogd, the kernel logging daemon. klogd intercepts kernel oopses and 
          logs them with syslogd, changing some of the useless information 
          like c010b860 with information that humans can use. In other words, 
          klogd is a kernel message logger which can perform name-address 
          resolution. Once klogd tranforms the kernel message, it uses 
          whatever logger is in place to log system wide messages, usually 
          syslogd. 
        </para>
        <para>
          To perform name-address resolution, klogd uses System.map. Now you

          Suppose you load a kernel module which generates an oops. An oops 
          message is generated, and klogd intercepts it. It is found that the 
          oops occured at d00cf810. Since this address belongs to a 
          dynamically loaded module, it has no entry in the System.map file. 
          klogd will search for it, find nothing, and conclude that a loadable 
          module must have generated the oops. klogd then queries the kernel 
          for symbols that were exported by loadable modules. Even if the 
          module author didn't export his symbols, at the very least, klogd 
          will know what module generated the oops, which is better than 
          knowing nothing about the oops at all.

          Where Should System.map Be Located?

        <para>
          System.map should be located wherever the software that uses it 
          looks for it. That being said, let me talk about where klogd looks 
          for it. Upon bootup, if klogd isn't given the location of System.map 
          as an argument, it will look for System.map in 3 places, in the 
          following order: 
          <orderedlist inheritnum="ignore" continuation="restarts">

        <para>
          System.map also has versioning information, and klogd intelligently 
          searches for the correct map file. For instance, suppose you're 
          running kernel 2.4.18 and the associated map file is 
          /boot/System.map. You now compile a new kernel 2.5.1 in the tree 
          /usr/src/linux. During the compiling process, the file 
          /usr/src/linux/System.map is created. When you boot your new kernel, 
          klogd will first look at /boot/System.map, determine it's not the 
          correct map file for the booting kernel, then look at 
          /usr/src/linux/System.map, determine that it is the correct map file 
          for the booting kernel and start reading the symbols.

          Apparently, not only does klogd look for the correct version of the

          A few drivers will need System.map to resolve symbols (since they're

          not work correctly without the System.map created for the particular 
          kernel you're currently running. This is NOT the same thing as a 
          module not loading because of a kernel version mismatch. That has to 
          do with the kernel version, not the kernel symbol table which 
          changes between kernels of the same version!

          Suppose you have multiple kernels on the same machine. You need a

          like: System.map does not match actual kernel Not a fatal error, but 
          can be annoying to see everytime you do a ps ax. Some software, like 
          dosemu, may not work correctly (although I don't know of anything 
          off the top of my head). Lastly, your klogd or ksymoops output will 
          not be reliable in case of a kernel oops. See the manual pages by 
          giving commands 'man ksymoops' and 'man klogd'.

            The Webmin is the most powerful and very popular system admin tool 
            for Linux. Webmin is so popular and it was awarded the best System 
            Administration tool for Solaris, BSD, Linux, HPUX, AIX, SCO and 
            others. Webmin had been winning awards year after year for the 
            past 5 years by many organisations, conferences and editors. 
            Webmin can also be used for admin of other OSes like AIX, Solaris, 
            HPUX, IRIX, BSD, SCO Unix, OSF, Darwin, Apple Macintosh Mac OS X 
            and Cygwin. The best supported systems at the moment are Solaris, 
            Linux (Redhat in particular) and FreeBSD. Webmin is written in 
            Perl and Perl is universal like "C" and unlike "C" it is scripting 
            language. Perl is "cousin-brother" of "C" language. But major 
            drawback is that you need a X-Window system, Apache Webserver and 
            Perl installed and running before using Webmin. And here is where 
            Linuxconf fills the gap - you do not need X-Window and others to 
            run Linuxconf. Linuxconf can run even in dumb text-terminal 
            console with ncurses. The Webmin is at

      You can automate the process of maintaining the Linux system with the 
      powerful tool like apt-get. The apt-get tool is immensely powerful and 
      used by millions of computers world-wide on Linux systems. The apt-get 
      utility works with Redhat Linux and Debian. The apt-get works with 
      distros which support RPM or Deb packages. The apt-get may work with 
      most of the distributions; if it does not you can very easily tailor the 
      code. Mandrake has tool called urpmi.

            parts of the kernel, and then prints the final "O". The 
            descriptors are placed at 0x0009d200. The boot message and a 
            prompt line, if specified, are printed. The pressing "Tab" at the 
            prompt, allows the user to specify a system and to provide 
            command-line specifications to the Linux Kernel, its drivers, and 
            the "init" program. Also, environment variables may be defined at 
            this point.

The following line is the prompt from /sbin/lilo:
boot:
Note: If Lilo is not used, then the boot code built into the head 
      of the Linux kernel, linux/arch/i386/boot/bootsect.S 
	  prints "Loading" and continues.
Lilo displays the following as it loads the kernel code. It gets the 
text "Linux-2.2.12" from the "label=..." specification in lilo.conf.

            The kernel code in /linux/arch/i386/boot/setup.S arranges the 
            transition from the processor running in real mode (DOS mode) to 
            protected mode (full 32-bit mode). Blocks of code named 
            Trampoline.S and Trampoline32.S help with the transition. Small 
            kernel images (zImage) are decompressed and loaded at 0x00010000. 
            Large kernel images (bzImage) are loaded instead at 0x00100000. 
            This code sets up the registers, decompresses the compressed 
            kernel (which has linux/arch/i386/head.S at its start), printing 
            the following 2 lines from linux/arch/i386/boot/compressed/misc.c 
            Uncompressing Linux... Ok. Booting the kernel. The i386-specific 
            setup.S code has now completed its job and it jumps to 0x00010000 
            (or 0x00100000) to start the generic Linux kernel code.

                  messages are also saved in memory and available using

      is the "initial ramdisk". It is enough files stored in a ramdisk to 
      store needed drivers . You need the drivers so that the kernel can mount 
      / and kick off init. The initrd is typically used for temporarily 
      booting the hardware into a state, that the real kernel vmlinuz can than 
      take over and continue the booting. For example - you can't read the 
      kernel off the scsi hard disk until you have a scsi driver loaded in the 
      kernel. (Solution: boot an initrd kernel that can read the real kernel 
      and use initrd to fix scsi booting problems) 
    </para>
    <para>
      You can avoid this file 'initrd.img' and eliminate the need of 
      'initrd.img', if you build your scsi drivers right into the kernel, 
      instead of into modules. (Many persons recommend this).

        SCSI Installation Complications and initrd

        Some of the following descriptions may be difficult to understand 
        without knowledge of kernel modules explained in Chapter 42. You may 
        want to come back to it later. 
      </para>
      <para>
        Consider a system with zero IDE disks and one SCSI disk containing a 
        LINUX installation. There are BIOS interrupts to read the SCSI disk, 
        just as there were for the IDE, so LILO can happily access a kernel 
        image somewhere inside the SCSI partition. However, the kernel is 
        going to be lost without a kernel module [lsqb ]See Chapter 42. The 
        kernel doesn't support every possible kind of hardware out there all 
        by itself. It is actually divided into a main part (the kernel image 
        discussed in this chapter) and hundreds of modules (loadable parts 
        that reside in /lib/modules/) that support the many type of SCSI, 
        network, sound etc., peripheral devices.] that understands the 
        particular SCSI driver. So although the kernel can load and execute, 
        it won't be able to mount its root file system without loading a SCSI 
        module first. But the module itself resides in the root file system in 
        /lib/modules/. This is a tricky situation to solve and is done in one 
        of two ways: either (a) using a kernel with preenabled SCSI support or 
        (b) using what is known as an initrd preliminary root file system 
        image. 
      </para>
      <para>
        The first method is what I recommend. It's a straightforward (though 
        time-consuming) procedure to create a kernel with SCSI support for 
        your SCSI card built-in (and not in a separate module). Built-in SCSI 
        and network drivers will also autodetect cards most of the time, 
        allowing immediate access to the device--they will work without being 
        given any options [lsqb ]Discussed in Chapter 42.] and, most 
        importantly, without your having to read up on how to configure them. 
        This setup is known as compiled-in support for a hardware driver (as 
        opposed to module support for the driver). The resulting kernel image 
        will be larger by an amount equal to the size of module. Chapter 42 
        discusses such kernel compiles. 
      </para>
      <para>
        The second method is faster but trickier. LINUX supports what is known 
        as an initrd image ( initial rAM disk image). This is a small, +1.5 
        megabyte file system that is loaded by LILO and mounted by the kernel 
        instead of the real file system. The kernel mounts this file system as 
        a RAM disk, executes the file /linuxrc, and then only mounts the real 
        file system.

        initrd/bin/sash is a statically linked shell from the sash-3.4

        /lib/ to initrd/lib/. (You can get the list of required DLLs by

        31.7 Modifying lilo.conf for initrd 
      </para>
      <para>
        Your lilo.conf file can be changed slightly to force use of an initrd 
        file system. Simply add the initrd option. For example: 
      </para>
      <para>
        <programlisting format="linespecific">
	boot=/dev/sda
	prompt
	timeout = 50
	compact
	vga = extended
	linear
	image = /boot/vmlinuz-2.2.17
	        initrd = /boot/initrd-2.2.17
	        label = linux
	        root = /dev/sda1
	        read-only
        </programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
        Notice the use of the linear option. This is a BIOS trick that you can 
        read about in lilo(5). It is often necessary but can make SCSI disks 
        nonportable to different BIOSs (meaning that you will have to rerun 
        lilo if you move the disk to a different computer).

        Kernel Compiles OK but make modules fail 
      </title>
      <para>
        Sympton: The kernel compiles ok producing bzImage but 'make modules' 
        fails. 
      </para>
      <para>
        Solution: This problem is most tricky - there can be many subtle 
        reasons. May be related to Linux distro or dependencies of packages 
        are not uptodate. This one is very peculiar of Redhat distribution but 
        may happen to other distributions. There are some "left over" files 
        which are hanging and causing problems. The remedy is to do 'make 
        mrproper' and 'make clean' and then do 'make modules'. But you may 
        want to copy the saved config file as shown below: 
        <programlisting format="linespecific">
bash# cd /usr/src/linux 
bash# mkdir /usr/src/kernelconfigs ;
bash# cp /usr/src/linux/.config  /usr/src/kernelconfigs/.config.save;
bash# cp /usr/src/linux/.config  /usr/src/linux/configs/.config.save  # ExtraSafe
bash# cp /boot/config*  /usr/src/linux/configs/  # ExtraSafe
bash# make clean
bash# make mrproper  # "MUST DO THIS mrproper", otherwise you will face hell lot of problems !!
bash# make clean
bash# cp /usr/src/kernelconfigs/.config.save .config  # In case you want to reuse the config file ??

          Wrong Config File Copied 
        </title>
        <para>
          If the 'make mrproper' in above section does not fix this problem, 
          then you are trapped by some other subtle problems. May be something 
          is seriously wrong with config file. You might have started with a 
          wrong CPU config file - you might have chosen ATHLON CPU type for 
          your Pentium machine or Cyrix CPU for your Athlon machine. Start all 
          over again, if you have Athlon CPU then copy the athlon.config or if 
          you have Intel 686 CPU then copy the i686.config file. Copy from the 
          default vanilla config file from /usr/src/linux/configs 
          <programlisting format="linespecific">
	bash# cp /usr/src/linux/configs/kernel-2.4.18-i686.config  /usr/src/linux/.config

          Still having problems? If above section does not fix the problems, 
          then you are trapped by some other subtle problems. Are you sure you 
          have all the dependencies of packages taken care of ?? Are all the 
          dependent packages in sync with each other? Did you install any 
          package with "--nodeps" option? You should automate the dependencies 
          with powerful tool like apt-get ( See the section "Install, Update 
          at Speed of Light" in

        modules' before, try running again for the second time (does not 
        hurt). Give 'make modules' and 'make modules_install' once again to 
        make sure for certain that all the loadable modules are put in place.

      <para>
        If the kernel fails to load a module (say loadable module for network

        for device right into the kernel. Sometimes

            loadable module will NOT work

        </emphasis>
        and the driver needs to be built right inside the kernel. For example 
        - some network cards do not support loadable module feature - you MUST 
        build the driver of the network card right into linux kernel. Hence, 
        in 'make xconfig' you MUST not select loadable module for this device.

        Huge or slow kernels 
      </title>
      <para>
        If your kernel is sucking up a lot of memory, is too large, and/or 
        just takes forever to compile even when you've got your new 
        Quadbazillium-III/4400 working on it, you've probably got lot of 
        unneeded stuff (device drivers, filesystems, etc) configured. If you 
        don't use it, don't configure it, because it does take up memory. The 
        most obvious symptom of kernel bloat is extreme swapping in and out of 
        memory to disk; if your disk is making a lot of noise and it's not one 
        of those old Fujitsu Eagles that sound like a jet landing when 
        turned off, look over your kernel configuration. 
      </para>
      <para>
        You can find out how much memory the kernel is using by taking the 
        total amount of memory in your machine and subtracting from it the 
        amount of ``total mem'' in 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          /proc/meminfo 
        </literal>
        or the output of the command ` 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">

        Kernel doesn't compile 
      </title>
      <para>
        If it does not compile, then it is likely that a patch failed, or your 
        source is somehow corrupt. Your version of gcc also might not be 
        correct, or could also be corrupt (for example, the include files 
        might be in error). Make sure that the symbolic links which Linus 
        describes in the 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          README 
        </literal>
        are set up correctly. In general, if a standard kernel does not 
        compile, something is seriously wrong with the system, and 
        reinstallation of certain tools is probably necessary. 
      </para>
      <para>
        In some cases, gcc can crash due to hardware problems. The error 
        message will be something like ``xxx exited with signal 15'' and it 
        will generally look very mysterious. I probably would not mention 
        this, except that it happened to me once - I had some bad cache 
        memory, and the compiler would occasionally barf at random. Try 
        reinstalling gcc first if you experience problems. You should only get 
        suspicious if your kernel compiles fine with external cache turned 
        off, a reduced amount of RAM, etc.

        Ooops! The best thing you can do here is to boot off of a floppy disk

        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          make zdisk 
        </literal>
        ' would do). You need to know where your root ( 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          / 
        </literal>
        ) filesystem is and what type it is (e.g. second extended, minix). In 
        the example below, you also need to know what filesystem your 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          /usr/src/linux 
        </literal>
        source tree is on, its type, and where it is normally mounted. 
      </para>
      <para>
        In the following example, 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          /

        is 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">

        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          /usr

        . Both are second extended filesystems. The working kernel image in

        The idea is that if there is a functioning 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">

        </literal>
        , it is possible to use that for the new floppy. Another alternative,

        in which you messed up your system) is discussed after the example.

      <para>
        First, boot from a boot/root disk combo or rescue disk, and mount the

        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          cd

        to the place where the working kernel image was. Note that /mnt +

        Place a formatted disk in drive ``A:'' (not your boot or root disk!), 
        dump the image to the disk, and configure it for your root filesystem:

      <para>
        cd /mnt/src/linux/arch/i386/boot dd if=bzImage of=/dev/fd0 rdev

        and unmount the normal

        filesystem:

        You should now be able to reboot your system as normal from this

      </para>
      <para>
        As mentioned above, there is another common alternative. If you

        ( 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          /vmlinuz 
        </literal>
        for example), you can use that for a boot disk. Supposing all of the 
        above conditions, and that my kernel image is 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          /vmlinuz 
        </literal>
        , just make these alterations to the example above: change 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          /dev/hda3

        to

      <para>
        Strangely enough, lot of people cannot get their ATAPI drives working, 
        probably because there are a number of things that can go wrong. 
      </para>
      <para>
        If your CD-ROM drive is the only device on a particular IDE interface, 
        it must be jumpered as ``master'' or ``single.'' Supposedly, this is 
        the most common error. 
      </para>
      <para>
        Creative Labs (for one) has put IDE interfaces on their sound cards 
        now. However, this leads to the interesting problem that while some 
        people only have one interface to being with, many have two IDE 
        interfaces built-in to their motherboards (at IRQ15, usually), so a 
        common practice is to make the soundblaster interface a third IDE port 
        (IRQ11, or so I'm told). 
      </para>
      <para>
        This causes problems with older Linux versions like 1.3 and below. in 
        that versions Linux don't support a third IDE interface. To get around 
        this, you have a few choices. 
      </para>
      <para>
        If you have a second IDE port already, chances are that you are not 
        using it or it doesn't already have two devices on it. Take the ATAPI 
        drive off the sound card and put it on the second interface. You can 
        then disable the sound card's interface, which saves an IRQ anyway. 
      </para>
      <para>
        If you don't have a second interface, jumper the sound card's 
        interface (not the sound card's sound part) as IRQ15, the second 
        interface. It should work.

        directory of your kernel source ( 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          /usr/src/linux/include/linux 
        </literal>
        in the typical system). If this link is not there, or points to the 
        wrong place, most things will not compile at all. If you decided that 
        the kernel source was taking too much room on the disk and deleted it, 
        this will obviously be a problem. Another way it might go wrong is 
        with file permissions; if your 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          root 
        </literal>
        has a umask which doesn't allow other users to see its files by 
        default, and you extracted the kernel source without the 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          p 
        </literal>
        (preserve filemodes) option, those users also won't be able to use the 
        C compiler. Although you could use the 
        <literal moreinfo="none" remap="tt">
          chmod 
        </literal>
        command to fix this, it is probably easier to re-extract the include 
        files. You can do this the same way you did the whole source at the 
        beginning, only with an additional argument:
