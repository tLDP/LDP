      This HOWTO aims to help beginning developers to leverage the power
      the the GNU Build System (GBS).  The GBS is composed of well-known
      tools such as &make; and of less-used utilities such as
      &autoconf;, &automake; or &libtool;.  The primary goal of the
      HOWTO is to ring developers up to speed with each of these tools,
      and, at another level to explain some of their inner workings.

    <title>About this HOWTO</title>

    <para>

      If you ever installed packages from source on a Unix environment,
      you will have encountered &makefile; that is used to compile the
      package.  When there was no &automake; or &autoconf;, it was a non
      trivial task to get big source packages to compile, leave alone
      getting them to work for you.  It often involved tweaking of the
      &makefile; and making changes to source.  Finding the necessary
      things that you need (like libraries, the right version of the
      library needed) before you could compile a particular package, was
      a difficult task.

    </para>

    <para>

      Another major problem that many software developers face is that
      of maintaining portability, achieving platform independence and
      building libraries.  This is important if the code written should
      run on a variety of platforms.  Finding the specifics of a machine
      and the operating system, and configuring the source of a package
      for successful compilation and working, is also a problem of
      interest.

    </para>

    <para>

      The GNU Autotools address these issues.  This HOWTO is a resource
      for first time users of the <emphasis>autotools</emphasis>. It is
      intended to be an introductory guide, to help with GNU &make;,
      &autoconf;, &automake; &libtool; etc.  It also tries to provide an
      explanation as to to how these tools work.  To be able to follow
      the explanations given in here, the reader is expected to be
      familiar with Unix like operating systems and the basics of
      programming.

  <title>Hello build system!</title>

  <para>

    The GNU Build System encompasses a number of components that assist
    a developer in each stage of the configure, compile and distribute
    process.  Projects using the suite of the GBS are recognizable by
    the ease with which they are installed.  The ubiquitous
    <command>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make
    install</command> does it all.

  </para>

  <para>

    This section of the document introduces the build tools and explains
    how to use them.  Though the treatment would not be in depth, it
    should help you understand the files that these tools operate on.
    The aim is to take the reader step by step, through the stages
    turning a set of source files of a <quote>project</quote> to conform
    to the <command>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make
    install</command> mantra.  We will work through each of these
    components using a <literal>Hello World!</literal> styled example.

  <sect2 id="hello-make">

    <title>Hello GNU &make;!</title>

    <para>

      If you are reading this document, it is possible that you already
      have prior experience with the &make; utility.  However, any
      discussion of the build system would be incomplete without a
      mention of &make;.

    </para>

    <sect3 id="make-whatis">

      <title>What is &make;?</title>

      <para>

        &make; is a utility for automatic compilation of a project's
        source code.  It is used in projects to find out if the files
        (typically C sources) that a certain <quote>target</quote>
        (typically object files and executables) depends on have
        changed, and re-generates the target.  It makes compiling only
        the necessary files of a big project as simple as typing
        &make;, when a few of them have been modified.  The input to
        the &make; utility is a &makefile;.

      </para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="make-example">

      <title>&make; in action</title>

      <para>

        A very minimal &makefile; to &make; a program called
        <filename>foo</filename> from its C source file,
        <filename>foo.c</filename> would look like:

      </para>

<screen>
&cmdline;<userinput>cat Makefile</userinput>

foo: foo.c
        gcc -o foo foo.c

&cmdline;
</screen>

      <para>

        The target in this &makefile; is <filename>foo</filename> and it
        depends on the <filename>foo.c</filename> dependency.  The
        second line (command) tells make how to build the target in case
        the dependency changes.  The command should be on its own line
        with a <emphasis>tab</emphasis> character (and
        <emphasis>not</emphasis> spaces) before it.

      </para>

      <para>

        The <filename>foo</filename> executable can then be created by
        issuing a <command>make foo</command> command in the directory
        where the above &makefile; is present.

      </para>

<screen>
&cmdline;<userinput>make</userinput>
gcc -o foo foo.c
&cmdline;
</screen>

      <para>

        A slightly more useful example would be:

      </para>

<screen>
&cmdline;<userinput>cat Makefile</userinput>

all: hw

hw: main.o hello.o world.o
      gcc main.o hello.o world.o -o hw

world.o: world.c hello.h world.h
      gcc -Wall -c hello.c

hello.o: hello.c hello.h
      gcc -Wall -c hello.c

world.o: world.c world.h
      gcc -Wall -c world.c

clean:
      rm -f hw hello.o world.o

&cmdline;
</screen>

      <para>

        The default target in this &makefile; (which is the first target
        that appears in the &makefile;) is <literal>all</literal>.
        <literal>all</literal> depends on <literal>hw</literal> which
        in-turn depends on <filename>main.o</filename>,
        <filename>hello.o</filename> and <filename>world.o</filename>.
        These can be <quote>made</quote> using the rules that have been
        specified for them respectively.  For example,
        <filename>hello.o</filename> is created using the command
        <command>gcc -Wall -c hello.c</command> whenever
        <filename>hello.c</filename> or <filename>hello.h</filename> are
        modified.

      </para>

<screen>
&cmdline;<userinput>make</userinput>
gcc -Wall -c main.c
gcc -Wall -c hello.c
gcc -Wall -c world.c
gcc main.o hello.o world.o -o hw
&cmdline;
</screen>

      <para>

        Another invocation of &make; (or <command>make all</command>)
        does nothing. This is because none of the files that &make;
        looks at have been modified.

      </para>

<screen>
&cmdline;<userinput>make all</userinput>
make: Nothing to be done for `all'.
&cmdline;
</screen>

      <para>

        However, if one of the files is changed (say
        <filename>hello.h</filename>), &make; will figure out the right
        files to be re-compiled (based on the dependencies in the
        &makefile;) and generate a new <filename>hw</filename>.

      </para>

<screen>
&cmdline;<userinput>touch hello.h</userinput>
&cmdline;<userinput>make all</userinput>
gcc -Wall -c main.c
gcc -Wall -c hello.c
gcc main.o hello.o world.o -o hw
&cmdline;
</screen>

      <para>

        The other target <literal>clean</literal> in the &makefile; can
        be invoked explicitly to remove the target files that have been
        generated.

      </para>

<screen>
&cmdline;<userinput>make clean</userinput>
rm -f hw main.o hello.o world.o
&cmdline;
</screen>

    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="make-variables">

      <title>Variables in &makefile;s</title>

      <para>

        A &makefile; can also be written using variables and wild-cards
        making it easy to modify and maintain.  For example, the above
        &makefile; can be re-written as:

      </para>

<screen>
&cmdline;<userinput>cat Makefile</userinput>

TARGET = hw
OBJS = main.o hello.o world.o
CC = gcc
CCOPTS = -Wall -c
RM = rm
RMOPTS = -f

all: $(TARGET)

$(TARGET): $(OBJS)
        $(CC) $(OBJS) -o $(TARGET)

main.o: main.c hello.h world.h
        $(CC) $(CCOPTS) $<

%.o: %.c %.h
        $(CC) $(CCOPTS) $<

clean:
        $(RM) $(RMOPTS) $(TARGET) $(OBJS)

&cmdline;
</screen>

      <para>

        Every <literal>$(VARIABLE)</literal> in the &makefile; is
        replaced with its value.  The generic rule <literal>%.o: %.c
        %.h</literal>

        <footnote>

          <para>

            In general, one source file would depend on more than one
            header file (like the <filename>main.o</filename>
            dependency) and the dependency rule is not as simple as
            this.  It is infact difficult to keep track of dependencies
            on header files and their dependencies with nested includes.
            There are ways of handling this (see the manual page of
            <command>makedepend</command> on your Linux machine and the
            <option>-M</option> option to <command>gcc</command>), but
            using &automake; makes this a cake-walk.

          </para>

        </footnote>

        says that each <filename>.o</filename> file is dependent on the
        corresponding <filename>.c</filename> and the
        <filename>.h</filename> files.  <literal>$@</literal> refers to
        the current target and <literal>$&lt</literal> refers to the
        first one among the list of dependencies of the current target.
        Note that this version of the &makefile; does not need a lot of
        modifications if a single source file and the corresponding
        header files are added.

      </para>

      <para>

        GNU &make; provides several other useful features like the
        <literal>VPATH</literal> directive to locate the source files
        that are not co-located with the &makefile;, facility for
        sophisticated wildcards, etc.  These are described in the <link

        manual</citetitle></link>.

      <para>

        We need to rely on other tools to ensure that a project is built
        and runs correctly on most flavors of Unix (including Linux of
        course).  These platform specific parameters are detected by the
        &configure_file; script generated by &autoconf;. &autoconf; also
        generates a &makefile;.  The input to the &configure_file;
        script are the &makefile_in; and the &configure_in; files.

      <para>

        The final (?) step to build a well-behaved and distributable
        software project is to supply &make; with a set of standard
        targets (<xref linkend="make-gnumakefile"/>) and to use a set of
        thoroughly tested recipes to build them.  This is where
        &automake; comes into play.  Starting from a high-level
        description of the project's components (source files, binaries
        to be built, documentation, additional data files) found in a
        &makefile_am;, &automake; is capable of generating a suitable
        &makefile_in;. This can be used by the &configure_file; script
        to generate the &makefile;.

        The &libtool; component favors the use of program libraries
        (sets of related object files grouped into a single archive).
        These libraries can the be used by all executables of a project,
        and in some cases, without being copied in every single
        executable.  Ways of building libraries vary much from platform
        to platform, fortunately, &libtool; simplifies this process,

  <title>An inside look</title>

    To the survivors of the former section, this is an inside look at
    the workings of all the GBS components.  For starters, it describes
    the innards of the &make; before covering a rather ill-known macro
    programming language, <command>m4</command> upon which several of
    the GBS tools are built.  It then scrutinizes &autoconf;, &automake;

  <title>GNU General Public License</title>
  <titleabbrev>GNU-GPL</titleabbrev>

  <sect1 id="gpl-preamble">

    <title>Preamble</title>

    <para>

      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
      freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General
      Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
      change free software - to make sure the software is free for all
      its users.  This General Public License applies to most of the
      Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
      authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation
      software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License
      instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

    </para>

    <para>

      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
      price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
      you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
      charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code
      or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
      use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
      do these things.

    </para>

    <para>

      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
      anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
      rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
      for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
      it.

    </para>

    <para>

      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
      gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
      that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
      get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
      know their rights.

    </para>

    <para>

      We protect your rights with two steps:

      <orderedlist>

        <listitem>

          <para>copyright the software, and </para>

        </listitem>

        <listitem>

          <para>

            offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
            copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

          </para>

        </listitem>

        </orderedlist>

    </para>

    <para>

      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
      certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
      this free software.  If the software is modified by someone else
      and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have
      is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others
      will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

    </para>

    <para>

      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
      patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a
      free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect
      making the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it
      clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or
      not licensed at all.

    </para>

      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
      modification follow.

    <title>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND
    MODIFICATION</title>

    <sect2>

      <title>Section 0</title>

      <para>

        This License applies to any program or other work which contains
        a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
        distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The
        "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a
        <quote>work based on the Program </quote> means either the
        Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
        say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
        verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
        language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without
        limitation in the term <quote>modification </quote>.) Each
        licensee is addressed as <quote>you</quote>.

      </para>

      <para>

        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
        not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The
        act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output
        from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a
        work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
        running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the
        Program does.

      </para>

    <sect2 id="gpl-section1">

      <title>Section 1</title>

      <para>

        You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
        source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
        conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
        appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
        intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
        absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
        Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

      </para>

      <para>

        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a

          <listitem>

            <para>

              You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
              that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the

              no charge to all third parties under the terms of this

            <para>

              If the modified program normally reads commands
              interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
              running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way,
              to print or display an announcement including an
              appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no
              warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and
              that users may redistribute the program under these
              conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of
              this License.

              <footnote>

              <para>

                Exception: If the Program itself is interactive but does
                not normally print such an announcement, your work based
                on the Program is not required to print an announcement.

              </para>

              </footnote>

            </para>

          </listitem>

        </orderedlist>

      </para>

      <para>

        These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
        identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
        Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
        separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
        do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
        separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as
        part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
        distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
        whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
        whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
        it.

      </para>

      <para>

        Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
        contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
        intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
        derivative or collective works based on the Program.

      </para>

      <para>

        In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
        Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program)
        on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
        the other work under the scope of this License.

        The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work

        complete source code means all the source code for all modules
        it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
        plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of
        the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source
        code distributed need not include anything that is normally
        distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
        components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
        on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
        accompanies the executable.

      <para>

        If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
        access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
        access to copy the source code from the same place counts as

        You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
        signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to
        modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These
        actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
        Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
        based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
        License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
        distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

      <title>Section 6</title>

      <para>

        Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
        Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from
        the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
        subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
        further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
        granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing
        compliance by third parties to this License.

      <title>Section 7</title>

      <para>

        If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
        infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
        issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
        agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
        License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
        License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
        simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
        pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
        distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license
        would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
        all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
        then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License
        would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

      <para>

        If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
        under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
        intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to
        apply in other circumstances.

      </para>

      <para>

        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
        any patents or other property right claims or to contest
        validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose
        of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
        system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
        people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
        software distributed through that system in reliance on
        consistent application of that system; it is up to the
        author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
        software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
        that choice.

      </para>

      <para>

        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
        believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

      <title>Section 8</title>

      <para>

        If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
        certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
        interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program
        under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
        limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
        permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such
        case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in
        the body of this License.

      <para>

        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
        new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
        but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

      </para>

      <para>

        Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
        Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
        to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
        the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
        version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
        Program does not specify a version number of this License, you
        may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
        Foundation.

        If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
        programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to
        the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
        copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
        Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
        decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
        status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
        the sharing and reuse of software generally.

    <title>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</title>

    <para>

      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the
      greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this
      is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and
      change under these terms.

    </para>

    <para>

      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is
      safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
      effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
      have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
      notice is found.

    </para>

    <para>

      &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what

      This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
      modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as

      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
      along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA
      02111-1307  USA

      Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
      mail.

      If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
      this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    </para>

    <para>

      Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
      Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
      `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome to
      redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for
      details.

    </para>

    <para>

      The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
      appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
      commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and
      `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
      suits your program.

    <para>

      You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
      your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the
      program, if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

      This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
      program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a
      subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit
      linking proprietary applications with the library.  If this is
      what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License
      instead of this License.
