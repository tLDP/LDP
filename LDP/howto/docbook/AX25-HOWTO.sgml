<Abstract>

<Para>
The Linux operating system is perhaps the only operating system in the
world that can boast native and standard support for the AX.25 packet
radio protocol utilized by Amateur Radio operators worldwide. This
document describes how to install and configure this support.
</Para>

<Sect1><Title>Introduction</Title>

<!-- TODO:
     Consider reorganizing structure of document to make it more logical
     and add more introductory information on packer radio and each of
     the protocols.
-->

<Para>
Amateur radio is a non-profit, non-commercial activity enjoyed by
hobbyists world-wide. Radio amateurs are licensed by government
authorities to use portions of the radio spectrum allocated to them
for non-commercial, non-profit activities including personal
communication, public service, and technical experimentation. Packet
Radio is a particular digital mode of communication that makes use of
networking protocols to provide computer to computer communication.
</Para>

<Para>
This document was originally an appendix to the HAM-HOWTO, but grew too large
to be reasonably managed in that fashion. This document describes how to
install and configure the native AX.25, NET/ROM and ROSE support for Linux. A
few typical configurations are described that could be used as models to work
from.
</Para>

<Para>
The Linux implementation of the amateur radio protocols is very flexible.
To people relatively unfamiliar with the Linux operating system the
configuration process may look daunting and complicated. It will take you a
little time to come to understand how the whole thing fits together. You
will find configuration very difficult if you have not properly prepared
yourself by learning about Linux in general. You cannot expect to switch
from some other environment to Linux without learning about Linux itself.

<Sect2><Title>Where to obtain new versions of this document</Title>

<Para>
The best place to obtain the latest version of this document is from a
Linux Documentation Project archive. The Linux Documentation Project runs
a web server and this document appears there as
<ULink URL="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/AX25-HOWTO.html">the AX25-HOWTO</ULink>.
This document is also available in various formats from the
<ULink URL="http://www.linuxdoc.org">Linux Documentation Project</ULink>.
</Para>

<Para>
You can always contact me, but I pass new versions of the document
directly to the LDP HOWTO coordinator, so if it isn't there then
chances are I haven't finished it.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Other related documentation</Title>

<Para>
There is a lot of related documentation. There are many documents that relate
to Linux networking in more general ways and I strongly recommend you also
read these as they will assist you in your efforts and provide you with
deeper insight into other possible configurations. They are:

</Sect1>

<Sect1><Title>The Packet Radio Protocols and Linux</Title>

<Para>
The <Emphasis>AX.25</Emphasis> protocol offers both connected and connectionless modes of
operation, and is used either by itself for point-point links, or to carry
other protocols such as TCP/IP and NET/ROM.
</Para>

<Para>
It is similar to X.25 level 2 in structure, with some extensions to make it
more useful in the amateur radio environment.
</Para>

<Para>
The NET/ROM protocol is an attempt at a full network protocol and uses AX.25 at
its lowest layer as a datalink protocol. It provides a network layer that is
an adapted form of AX.25. The NET/ROM protocol features dynamic routing and
node aliases.
</Para>

<Para>
The ROSE protocol was conceived and first implemented by Tom Moulton W2VY and
is an implementation of the X.25 packet layer protocol and is designed to
operate with AX.25 as its datalink layer protocol. It too provides a network
layer. ROSE addresses take the form of 10 digit numbers. The first four digits
are called the Data Network Identification Code (DNIC) and are taken from
Appendix B of the CCITT X.121 recommendation. More information on the ROSE
protocol may be obtained from the
<ULink URL="http://www.rats.org/">RATS Web server</ULink>.
</Para>

<Para>
Alan Cox developed some early kernel based AX.25 software support for
Linux. <ULink URL="mailto:g4klx@g4klx.demon.co.uk">Jonathon
Naylor</ULink> has taken up ongoing development of the code, has added
NET/ROM and ROSE support and is now the developer of the AX.25 related
kernel code. DAMA support was developed by
<ULink URL="mailto:jreuter@poboxes.com">Joerg</ULink>, DL1BKE. Baycom and
Soundmodem support were added by 
<ULink URL="mailto:sailer@ife.ee.ethz.ch">Thomas Sailer</ULink>.
The AX.25 software is now maintained by a small team of developers
on <ULink URL="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</ULink>.
</Para>

<Para>
The Linux code supports KISS and 6PACK based TNC's (Terminal Node
Controllers), the Ottawa PI card, the Gracilis PacketTwin card and
other Z8530 SCC based cards with the generic SCC driver, several
parallel and serial port Baycom modems, and serial port YAM
modems. Thomas Sailer's kernel soundmodem driver supports SoundBlaster
and sound cards based on the Crystal chip set, and his newer user-mode
soundmodem uses the standard kernel sound drivers, so it should work
with any sound card supported under Linux.
</Para>

<Para>
The user programs contain a simple PMS (Personal Message System), a
beacon facility, a line mode connect program,
<Literal>listen</Literal> (an example of how to capture all AX.25
frames at raw interface level), and programs to configure the NET/ROM
protocol. Also included are an AX.25 server style program to handle
and dispatch incoming AX.25 connections and a NET/ROM daemon which
does most of the hard work for NET/ROM support.
</Para>

<Para>
There are utility programs to support APRS, including digipeating and
gatewaying to the Internet.
</Para>

<Sect2><Title>How it all fits together</Title>

<Para>
The Linux AX.25 implementation is a brand new implementation. While in many
ways it may looks similar to NOS, or BPQ or other AX.25 implementations, it
is none of these and is not identical to any of them. The Linux AX.25
implementation is capable of being configured to behave almost identically
to other implementations, but the configuration process is very different.
</Para>

<Para>
To assist you in understanding how you need to think when configuring this
section describes some of the structural features of the AX.25 implementation
and how it fits into the context of the overall Linux structure.

This diagram simply illustrates that NET/ROM, ROSE and TCP/IP all run directly
on top of AX.25, but that each of these protocols is treated as a separate
protocol at the programming interface. The `<Literal>_</Literal>' names are
simply the names given to the `<Emphasis>Address Family</Emphasis>' of each of these
protocols when writing programs to use them. The important thing to note here
is the implicit dependence on the configuration of your AX.25 devices before
you can configure your NET/ROM, ROSE or TCP/IP devices.

This diagram is a little more general than the first. This diagram attempts to
show the relationship between user applications, the kernel and the hardware.
It also shows the relationship between the Socket application programming
interface, the actual protocol modules, the kernel networking devices and the
device drivers. Anything in this diagram is dependent on anything underneath
it, and in general you must configure from the bottom of the diagram upwards.
So for example, if you want to run the <Emphasis>call</Emphasis> program you must also
configure the hardware, then ensure that the kernel has the appropriate device
driver, that you create the appropriate network device, that the kernel
includes the desired protocol that presents a programming interface that the
<Emphasis>call</Emphasis> program can use. I have attempted to lay out this document in
roughly that order.
</Para>

</Sect2>

</Sect1>

<Sect1><Title>The AX.25/NET/ROM/ROSE software components</Title>

<Para>
The AX.25 software is comprised of three components: the kernel source, the
network configuration tools and the utility programs.
</Para>

<Para>
AX.25 support in the Linux kernel has been fairly stable since the 2.2
series of kernel versions. This document assumes you are using the
most recent kernel, which as the time of writing was 2.4.9.
</Para>

<Note>
<Para>
Software versions listed in this document were the latest at the time
of writing, but are subject to change. Check for newer versions
when downloading them.
</Para>

<Sect2><Title>Finding the kernel, tools and utility packages</Title>

<Sect3><Title>The kernel source</Title>

<Para>
The kernel source can be found at <Literal>www.kernel.org</Literal> and
<Literal>ftp.kernel.org</Literal>.
For the 2.4.9 kernel it would be downloaded from
<ULink URL="ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.9.tar.gz">

<Sect3><Title>The AX.25 utilities</Title>

<Para>
The old ax25-utils used with the 2.0 and 2.1 kernels is now obsolete
and has been replaced with new packages hosted on

<Sect1><Title>Installing the AX.25/NET/ROM/ROSE software</Title>

<Para>
To successfully install AX.25 support on your Linux system you must configure
and install an appropriate kernel and then install the AX.25 utilities.
</Para>

<Tip>
<Para>
Rather than building and installing from source, you may prefer to
install prebuilt binary packages for your system. Debian and RPM
format packages are available on various archive sites including
<ULink URL="http://www.debian.org">http://www.debian.org</ULink> and
<ULink URL="http://rpmfind.net">http://rpmfind.net</ULink>; look for
"ax25". Incidently, the Debian Linux distribution is considered by
many people to be one of the more "Amateur Radio friendly"
distributions, and provides many amateur radio applications as Debian
packages (one of the founders of the project is a ham).
</Para>
</Tip>

<Sect2><Title>Compiling the kernel</Title>

<Para>
If you are already familiar with the process of compiling the Linux kernel
then you can skip this section, just be sure to select the appropriate options
when compiling the kernel. If you are not, then read on. You may also want to
read the
<ULink URL="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">Linux Kernel HOWTO</ULink>.

</Para>

<Para>
The normal place for the kernel source to be unpacked to is the
<Literal>/usr/src</Literal> directory into a subdirectory called <Literal>linux</Literal>.
To do this you should be logged in as <Literal>root</Literal> and execute a series
of commands similar to the following:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# cd /usr/src
# mv linux linux.old
# tar xzvf linux-2.4.9.tar.gz
# cd linux
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
After you have unpacked the kernel source, you need to run the
configuration script and choose the options that suit your hardware
configuration and the options that you wish built into your kernel.
You do this by using the command:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# make menuconfig
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
If you are running X you can get a graphical interface using:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# make xconfig
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
You might also try:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# make config
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
I'm going to describe the full screen method (menuconfig) because it is easier
to move around, but use whichever you are most comfortable with.
</Para>

<Para>
In either case you will be offered a range of options at which you must
answer `Y' or `N'. (Note you may also answer `M' if you are using modules.
For the sake of simplicity I will assume you are not, please make appropriate
modifications if you are).
</Para>

<Para>
The options most relevant to an AX.25 configuration are:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>

</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
The options I have flagged with a `<Literal>*</Literal>' are those
that you <Emphasis>must</Emphasis> must answer `Y' to. The rest are
dependent on what hardware you have and what other options you want to
include. Some of these options are described in more detail later on,
so if you don't know what you want yet, then read ahead and come back
to this step later.
</Para>

<Para>
After you have completed the kernel configuration you should be able to
cleanly compile your new kernel:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# make dep
# make clean
# make zImage
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
Make sure you move your <Literal>arch/i386/boot/zImage</Literal> file
wherever you want it and then edit your
<Literal>/etc/lilo.conf</Literal> file and rerun
<Emphasis>lilo</Emphasis> to ensure that you actually boot from it.
</Para>

<Sect3><Title>A word about kernel modules</Title>

<Para>

Compiling drivers as modules is useful if you only use AX.25
occasionally and want to be able to load and unload them on demand to
save system resources. However, some people have problems getting the
modularized drivers working because they are more complicated to
configure. If you've chosen to compile any drivers as modules, then
you'll also need to run the commands:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# make modules
# make modules_install
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
to install your modules in the appropriate location.
</Para>

<Para>
You will also need to add some entries into your <Literal>/etc/modules.conf</Literal>
file to ensure that the <Emphasis>kerneld</Emphasis> program knows how to locate the
kernel modules. You should add/modify the following:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
alias net-pf-3     ax25
alias net-pf-6     netrom
alias net-pf-11    rose
alias tty-ldisc-1  slip
alias tty-ldisc-3  ppp
alias tty-ldisc-5  mkiss
alias bc0          baycom
alias nr0          netrom
alias pi0a         pi2
alias pt0a         pt
alias scc0         optoscc    (or one of the other scc drivers)
alias sm0          soundmodem
alias tunl0        newtunnel
alias char-major-4 serial
alias char-major-5 serial
alias char-major-6 lp
</Screen>
</Para>

<Tip>
<Para>
On Debian-based Linux systems these entries should go into the file
<Literal>/etc/modutils/aliases</Literal> and then you need to run
<Literal>/sbin/update-mpodules</Literal>.
</Para>
</Tip>

</Sect3>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>The AX.25 library, tools, and application programs</Title>

<Para>
After you have successfully compiled and booted your new kernel you
need to compile and install the ax25 library, tools, and application
programs.
</Para>

<Para>
To compile and install libax25 you should use a series of commands
similar to the following:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# cd /usr/src
# tar xzvf libax25-0.0.7.tar.gz
# cd libax25-0.0.7
# ./configure --exec_prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
# make
# make install
</Screen>
</Para>

<Tip>
<Para>
The arguments to the <Literal>configure</Literal> command ensure that
the files will be installed in the "standard" places under the
directory <Literal>/usr</Literal> in subdirectories
<Literal>bin</Literal>, <Literal>sbin</Literal>,
<Literal>etc</Literal> and <Literal>man</Literal>. If you simply run
configure with no options it will default to putting all files under
<Literal>/usr/local</Literal>. This can cause the situation where you
have configuration files in both <Literal>/usr</Literal> and
<Literal>/usr/local</Literal>. If you want to ensure that this can't
happen you can make <Literal>/usr/local/etc/ax25</Literal> a symbolic
link to <Literal>/etc/ax25</Literal> at the very beginning of the
install process and then you won't have to worry about it.
</Para>
</Tip>

<Para>
If this is a first time installation, that is you've never installed any
ax25 code on your machine before, you should also use the:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# make installconf
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
command to install some sample configuration files into the <Literal>/etc/ax25/</Literal>
directory from which to work.
</Para>

<Para>
You can now build install the AX.25 tools in a similar fashion:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# cd /usr/src
# tar xzvf ax25-tools-0.0.6.tar.gz
# cd ax25-tools-0.0.6
# ./configure --prefix=/usr  --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
# make
# make install
# make installconf (if you want to install the configuration files)
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
And finally you can install the AX.25 applications:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# cd /usr/src
# tar xzvf ax25-apps-0.0.4.tar.gz
# cd ax25-apps-0.0.4
# ./configure --prefix=/usr  --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
# make

<!-- TODO:
     Take more of the information from http://www.febo.com/linux-ax25/index.html
     and incorporate it into this HOWTO (with credit).
-->

<Para>
Each of the AX.25 applications read a particular configuration file to obtain
the parameters for the various AX.25 ports configured on your Linux machine.
For AX.25 ports the file that is read is the <Literal>/etc/ax25/axports</Literal> file.
You must have an entry in this file for each AX.25 port you want on your
system.
</Para>

<Sect2><Title>Creating the AX.25 network device</Title>

<Para>
The network device is what is listed when you use the `<Emphasis>ifconfig</Emphasis>'
command. This is the object that the Linux kernel sends and receives network
data from. Nearly always the network device has a physical port associated
with it, but there are occasions where this isn't necessary. The network
device does relate directly to a device driver.
</Para>

<Para>
In the Linux AX.25 code there are a number of device drivers. The most common
is probably the KISS driver, but others are the SCC driver(s), the Baycom
driver and the Soundmodem driver.
</Para>

<Para>
Each of these device drivers will create a network device when it is started.

    ...
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
Probably the most common configuration will be for a KISS TNC on a
serial port. You will need to have the TNC preconfigured and
connected to your serial port. You can use a communications program
like <Emphasis>minicom</Emphasis> or <Emphasis>seyon</Emphasis> to
configure the TNC into kiss mode.
</Para>

<Para>
To create a KISS device you use the <Emphasis>kissattach</Emphasis>
program. In it simplest form you can use the
<Emphasis>kissattach</Emphasis> program as follows:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# /usr/sbin/kissattach /dev/ttyS0 radio 44.135.96.242
# kissparms -p radio -t 100 -s 100 -r 25
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
The <Emphasis>kissattach</Emphasis> command will create a KISS network
device. These devices are called `<Literal>ax[0-9]</Literal>'. The
first time you use the <Emphasis>kissattach</Emphasis> command it
creates `<Literal>ax0</Literal>', the second time it creates
`<Literal>ax1</Literal>' etc. Each KISS device has an associated
serial port.
</Para>

<Para>
The <Emphasis>kissparms</Emphasis> command allows you to set various
KISS parameters on a KISS device.
</Para>

<Para>
Specifically the example presented would create a KISS network device
using the serial device `<Literal>/dev/ttyS0</Literal>' and the entry
from the <Literal>/etc/ax25/axports</Literal> with a port name of
`<Literal>radio</Literal>'. It then configures it with a
<Emphasis>txdelay</Emphasis> and <Emphasis>slottime</Emphasis> of 100
milliseconds and a <Emphasis>ppersist</Emphasis> value of 25.
</Para>

<Para>

</Para>

<Sect4><Title>Configuring for Dual Port TNC's</Title>

<Para>
The <Emphasis>mkiss</Emphasis> utility included in the ax25-utils
distribution allows you to make use of both modems on a dual port
TNC. Configuration is fairly simple. It works by taking a single
serial device connected to a single multiport TNC and making it look
like a number of devices each connected to a single port TNC. You do
this <Emphasis>before</Emphasis> you do any of the AX.25
configuration. The devices that you then do the AX.25 configuration on
are pseudo-TTY interfaces, (<Literal>/dev/ttyq*</Literal>), and not
the actual serial device. Pseudo-TTY devices create a kind of pipe
through which programs designed to talk to tty devices can talk to
other programs designed to talk to tty devices. Each pipe has a master
and a slave end. The master end is generally called
`<Literal>/dev/ptyq*</Literal>' and the slave ends are called
`<Literal>/dev/ttyq*</Literal>'. There is a one to one relationship
between masters and slaves, so <Literal>/dev/ptyq0</Literal> is the
master end of a pipe with <Literal>/dev/ttyq0</Literal> as its
slave. You must open the master end of a pipe before opening the slave
end. <Emphasis>mkiss</Emphasis> exploits this mechanism to split a
single serial device into separate devices.
</Para>

<Para>
Example: if you have a dual port TNC and it is connected to your
<Literal>/dev/ttyS0</Literal> serial device at 9600 bps, the command:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# /usr/sbin/mkiss -s 9600 /dev/ttyS0 /dev/ptyq0 /dev/ptyq1
# /usr/sbin/kissattach /dev/ttyq0 port1 44.135.96.242
# /usr/sbin/kissattach /dev/ttyq1 port2 44.135.96.242
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
would create two pseudo-tty devices that each look like a normal
single port TNC. You would then treat <Literal>/dev/ttyq0</Literal>
and <Literal>/dev/ttyq1</Literal> just as you would a conventional
serial device with TNC connected. This means you'd then use the
<Emphasis>kissattach</Emphasis> command as described above, on each of
those, in the example for AX.25 ports called <Literal>port1</Literal>
and <Literal>port2</Literal>. You shouldn't use
<Emphasis>kissattach</Emphasis> on the actual serial device as the
<Emphasis>mkiss</Emphasis> program uses it.
</Para>

<Para>
The <Emphasis>mkiss</Emphasis> command has a number of optional
arguments that you may wish to use. They are summarized as follows:

<Para>
Your first step should be to determine the i/o and addresses of the
serial or parallel port(s) you have Baycom modem(s) connected to.
When you have these you must configure the Baycom driver with them.
</Para>

<Para>
The Baycom driver creates network devices called:

<Para>
The <Emphasis>sethdlc</Emphasis> utility allows you to configure the

<Para>
For example, a simple configuration.
Disable the serial driver for COM1: then configure the Baycom driver for a

</Para>

<Para>
Again the <Emphasis>sethdlc</Emphasis> man page is the source of the most complete information

<Para>
The Baycom driver creates standard network devices that the AX.25
Kernel code can use. Configuration is much the same as that for a PI

</Para>

<Para>
The first step is to configure the device with an AX.25 callsign. The
<Emphasis>ifconfig</Emphasis> utility may be used to perform this.
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# /sbin/ifconfig bc0 hw ax25 VK2KTJ-15 up

</Para>

<Para>
will assign the Baycom device <Literal>bc0</Literal> the AX.25

<Emphasis>ifconfig</Emphasis> command to bring the device up though:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# ifconfig bc0 up
# axparms -setcall bc0 vk2ktj-15
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
The next step is to create an entry in the <Literal>/etc/ax25/axports</Literal> file
as you would for any other device. The entry in the <Literal>axports</Literal> file is
associated with the network device you've configured by the callsign you
configure. The entry in the <Literal>axports</Literal> file that has the callsign that
you configured the Baycom device with is the one that will be used to
refer to it.
</Para>

<Para>
You may then treat the new AX.25 device as you would any other. You can
configure it for TCP/IP, add it to ax25d and run NET/ROM or ROSE over it
as you please.

</Para>

<Para>
Thomas Sailer has built a driver for the kernel that allows you to
use your soundcard as a modem. Connect your radio directly to your
soundcard to play packet! Thomas recommends at least a 486DX2/66 if you
want to use this software as all of the digital signal processing is done
by the main CPU.
</Para>

<Para>
The driver currently emulates 1200 bps AFSK, 4800 HAPN and 9600 FSK (G3RUH
compatible) modem types. The only sound cards currently supported are
SoundBlaster and Windows Sound System Compatible models. If you have a sound
card of another type, you can try the user-mode soundmodem described later
in this document.
</Para>

<Para>
The sound cards require some circuitry to help them drive the
Push-To-Talk circuitry, and information on this is available from
<ULink URL="http://www.baycom.org/~tom/pcf/ptt_circ/ptt.html">Thomas's
Soundmodem PTT circuit web page</ULink>. There are quite a few
possible options, they are: detect the sound output from the
soundcard, or use output from a parallel port, serial port or MIDI
port. Circuit examples for each of these are on Thomas's site.
</Para>

<Para>
The Soundmodem driver creates network devices called:
<Literal>sm0</Literal>, <Literal>sm1</Literal>, <Literal>sm2</Literal> etc when it is configured.
</Para>

<Note>
<Para>
The Soundmodem driver competes for the same resources as the Linux
sound driver, so if you wish to use the Soundmodem driver you must
ensure that the Linux sound driver is not installed. You can, of
course, compile them both as modules and insert and remove them as you
wish.
</Para>
</Note>

<Sect4><Title>Configuring the sound card</Title>

<Para>
The Soundmodem driver does not initialize the sound card. The ax25-utils
package includes a utility to do this called `<Emphasis>setcrystal</Emphasis>' that may
be used for sound cards based on the Crystal chip set. If you have some other
card then you will have to use some other software to initialize it.
Its syntax is fairly straightforward:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
setcrystal [-w wssio] [-s sbio] [-f synthio] [-i irq] [-d dma] [-c dma2]
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
So, for example, if you wished to configure a SoundBlaster card at i/o
base address 0x388, irq 10 and DMA 1 you would use:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# setcrystal -s 0x388 -i 10 -d 1
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
To configure a Window Sound System card at i/o base address 0x534, irq 5, DMA 3
you would use:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# setcrystal -w 0x534 -i 5 -d 3
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
The <Literal>[-f synthio]</Literal> parameter is the set the synthesizer address, and the
<Literal>[-c dma2]</Literal> parameter is to set the second DMA channel to allow full duplex
operation.
</Para>

</Sect4>

<Sect4><Title>Configuring the Soundmodem driver</Title>

<Para>
When you have configured the soundcard you need to configure the driver
telling it where the sound card is located and what sort of modem you wish
it to emulate.
</Para>

<Para>
The <Emphasis>sethdlc</Emphasis> utility allows you to configure the driver with these
parameters, or, if you have only one soundcard installed you may specify
the parameters on the <Emphasis>insmod</Emphasis> command line when you load the
Soundmodem module.
</Para>

<Para>
For example, a simple configuration, with one SoundBlaster soundcard
configured as described above emulating a 1200 bps modem:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# insmod hdlcdrv
# insmod soundmodem mode="sbc:afsk1200" iobase=0x220 irq=5 dma=1
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
This is not really the preferred way to do it. The <Emphasis>sethdlc</Emphasis> utility
works just as easily with one device as with many.
</Para>

<Para>
The <Emphasis>sethdlc</Emphasis> man page has the full details, but a couple of examples
will illustrate the most important aspects of this configuration. The
following examples assume you have already loaded the Soundmodem modules
using:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# insmod hdlcdrv
# insmod soundmodem
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
or that you compiled the kernel with the driver inbuilt.
</Para>

<Para>
Configure the driver to support the Windows Sound System card we configured
above to emulate a G3RUH 9600 compatible modem as device <Literal>sm0</Literal> using a
parallel port at 0x378 to key the Push-To-Talk:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# sethdlc -p -i sm0 mode wss:fsk9600 io 0x534 irq 5 dma 3 pario 0x378
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
Configure the driver to support the SoundBlaster card we configured above
to emulate a 4800 bps HAPN modem as device <Literal>sm1</Literal> using the serial port
located at 0x2f8 to key the Push-To-Talk:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# sethdlc -p -i sm1 mode sbc:hapn4800 io 0x388 irq 10 dma 1 serio 0x2f8
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
Configure the driver to support the SoundBlaster card we configured above
to emulate a 1200 bps AFSK modem as device <Literal>sm1</Literal> using the serial port
located at 0x2f8 to key the Push-To-Talk:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# sethdlc -p -i sm1 mode sbc:afsk1200 io 0x388 irq 10 dma 1 serio 0x2f8
</Screen>
</Para>

</Sect4>

<Sect4><Title>Configuring the AX.25 channel access parameters</Title>

<Para>
The AX.25 channel access parameters are the equivalent of the KISS ppersist,
txdelay and slottime type parameters. You use the <Emphasis>sethdlc</Emphasis> utility for
this as well.
</Para>

<Para>
Again the <Emphasis>sethdlc</Emphasis> man page is the source of the most complete information
but another example of two won't hurt:
</Para>

<Para>
Configure the <Literal>sm0</Literal> device with TxDelay of 100 mS, SlotTime of 50mS,
PPersist of 128 and full duplex:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# sethdlc -i sm0 -a txd 100 slot 50 ppersist 128 full
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
Note that the timing values are in milliseconds.
</Para>

</Sect4>

<Sect4><Title>Setting the audio levels and tuning the driver</Title>

<Para>
It is very important that the audio levels be set correctly for any radio
based modem to work. This is equally true of the Soundmodem.
Thomas has developed some utility programs that make this task easier.
They are called <Emphasis>smdiag</Emphasis> and <Emphasis>smmixer</Emphasis>.
</Para>

<Para>
<VariableList>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Emphasis>smdiag</Emphasis></Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
provides two types of display, either an oscilloscope
type display or an eye pattern type display.
</Para>

<Term><Emphasis>smmixer</Emphasis></Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>

</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
</VariableList>
To start the <Emphasis>smdiag</Emphasis> utility in 'eye' mode for the Soundmodem device
<Literal>sm0</Literal> you would use:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# smdiag -i sm0 -e
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
To start the <Emphasis>smmixer</Emphasis> utility for the Soundmodem
device <Literal>sm0</Literal> you would use:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# smmixer -i sm0
</Screen>
</Para>

</Sect4>

<Sect4><Title>Configuring the Kernel AX.25 to use the Soundmodem</Title>

<Para>
The Soundmodem driver creates standard network devices that the AX.25
Kernel code can use. Configuration is much the same as that for a PI
or PacketTwin card.
</Para>

<Para>
The first step is to configure the device with an AX.25 callsign.
The <Emphasis>ifconfig</Emphasis> utility may be used to perform this.
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# /sbin/ifconfig sm0 hw ax25 VK2KTJ-15 up
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
will assign the Soundmodem device <Literal>sm0</Literal> the AX.25
callsign <Literal>VK2KTJ-15</Literal>. Alternatively you can use the
<Emphasis>axparms</Emphasis> command, but you still need the
<Emphasis>ifconfig</Emphasis> utility to bring the device up:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# ifconfig sm0 up
# axparms -setcall sm0 vk2ktj-15
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
The next step is to create an entry in the <Literal>/etc/ax25/axports</Literal> file
as you would for any other device. The entry in the <Literal>axports</Literal> file is
associated with the network device you've configured by the callsign you
configure. The entry in the <Literal>axports</Literal> file that has the callsign that
you configured the Soundmodem device with is the one that will be used to
refer to it.
</Para>

<Para>
You may then treat the new AX.25 device as you would any other. You can
configure it for TCP/IP, add it to ax25d and run NET/ROM or ROSE over it
as you please.
</Para>

If you already have a working configuration for your card under NOS, then
you can use the <Emphasis>gencfg</Emphasis> command to convert the PE1CHL NOS driver
commands into a form suitable for use in the z8530 driver configuration
file.
</Para>

<Para>
To use <Emphasis>gencfg</Emphasis> you simply invoke it with the same parameters as you
used for the PE1CHL driver in NET/NOS. For example:

<Sect4><Title>Channel Configuration</Title>

<Para>
The Channel Configuration section is where you specify all of the other
parameters associated with the port you are configuring. Again this
section is broken into stanzas. One stanza represents one logical port, and
therefore there would be two of these for each one of the hardware parameters
stanzas as each 8530 SCC supports two ports.
</Para>

<Para>
These keywords and arguments are also written to the <Literal>/etc/z8530drv.conf</Literal>

<Para>
Sequence is very important in this section, but if you stick with the suggested
sequence it should work okay. The keywords and arguments are:
<VariableList>

<VarListEntry>
<Term>device</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
this keyword must be the first line of a port definition and

<Sect4><Title>Using the driver</Title>

<Para>
To use the driver you simply treat the <Literal>/dev/scc*</Literal> devices just as
you would a serial tty device with a KISS TNC connected to it. For example,
to configure Linux Kernel networking to use your SCC card you could use
something like:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# kissattach -s 4800 /dev/scc0 VK2KTJ
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
You can also use NOS to attach to it in precisely the same way. From JNOS
for example you would use something like:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
attach asy scc0 0 ax25 scc0 256 256 4800
</Screen>
</Para>

</Sect4>

<Sect4><Title>The <Emphasis>sccstat</Emphasis> and <Emphasis>sccparam</Emphasis> tools</Title>

<Para>
To assist in the diagnosis of problems you can use the <Emphasis>sccstat</Emphasis>
program to display the current configuration of an SCC device. To use it
try:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# sccstat /dev/scc0
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
you will displayed a very large amount of information relating to the
configuration and health of the <Literal>/dev/scc0</Literal> SCC port.
</Para>

<Para>
The <Emphasis>sccparam</Emphasis> command allows you to change or modify a configuration
after you have booted. Its syntax is very similar to the NOS <Literal>param</Literal>
command, so to set the <Literal>txtail</Literal> setting of a device to 100mS you
would use:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# sccparam /dev/scc0 txtail 0x8

<Para>
Linux supports BPQ Ethernet compatibility. This enables you to run the AX.25
protocol over your Ethernet LAN and to interwork your linux machine with
other BPQ machines on the LAN.
</Para>

<Para>
The BPQ network devices are named `<Literal>bpq[0-9]</Literal>'. The
`<Literal>bpq0</Literal>' device is associated with the
`<Literal>eth0</Literal>' device, the `<Literal>bpq1</Literal>' device
with the `<Literal>eth1</Literal>' device etc.
</Para>

<Para>
Configuration is quite straightforward. You firstly must have configured
a standard Ethernet device. This means you will have compiled your kernel
to support your Ethernet card and tested that this works. Refer to the
<ULink URL="Ethernet-HOWTO.html">Ethernet-HOWTO</ULink>
for more information on how to do this.
</Para>

<Para>
To configure the BPQ support you need to configure the Ethernet device with
an AX.25 callsign. The following command will do this for you:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# /sbin/ifconfig bpq0 hw ax25 vk2ktj-14 up
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
Again, remember that the callsign you specify should match the entry in the
<Literal>/etc/ax25/axports</Literal> file that you wish to use for this port.
</Para>

</Sect3>

<Sect3><Title>Configuring the BPQ Node to talk to the Linux AX.25 support</Title>

<Para>
BPQ Ethernet normally uses a multicast address. The Linux implementation does
not, and instead it uses the normal Ethernet broadcast address. The NET.CFG
file for the BPQ ODI driver should therefore be modified to look similar to
this:

<Sect2><Title>Creating the <Literal>/etc/ax25/axports</Literal> file</Title>

<Para>
The <Literal>/etc/ax25/axports</Literal> is a simple text file that you create with

</Para>

<Para>

</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
Remember, you must assign unique callsign/ssid to each AX.25 port you create.
Create one entry for each AX.25 device you want to use, this includes KISS,
Baycom, SCC, PI, PT and Soundmodem ports. Each entry here will describe exactly
one AX.25 network device. The entries in this file are associated with the
network devices by the callsign/ssid. This is at least one good reason for
requiring unique callsign/ssid.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Configuring AX.25 routing</Title>

<Para>
You may wish to configure default digipeaters paths for specific
hosts. This is useful for both normal AX.25 connections and also IP
based connections. The <Emphasis>axparms</Emphasis> command enables
you to do this. Again, the <Emphasis>man</Emphasis> page offers a
complete description, but a simple example might be:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# /usr/sbin/axparms -route add radio VK2XLZ VK2SUT
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
This command would set a digipeater entry for
<Literal>VK2XLZ</Literal> via <Literal>VK2SUT</Literal> on the AX.25
port named <Literal>radio</Literal>.
</Para>

</Sect2>

</Sect1>

<Sect1><Title>Configuring an AX.25 interface for TCP/IP</Title>

<Para>
It is very simple to configure an AX.25 port to carry TCP/IP. If you
have KISS interfaces then there are two methods for configuring an IP
address. The <Emphasis>kissattach</Emphasis> command has an option
that allows you to specify an IP address. The more conventional method
using the <Emphasis>ifconfig</Emphasis> command will work on all
interface types.
</Para>

<Para>
So, modifying the previous KISS example:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# /usr/sbin/kissattach -i 44.136.8.5 -m 512 /dev/ttyS0 radio
# /sbin/route add -net 44.136.8.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 ax0
# /sbin/route add default ax0
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
to create the AX.25 interface with an IP address of <Literal>44.136.8.5</Literal> and
an <Literal>MTU</Literal> of <Literal>512</Literal> bytes. You should still use the
<Emphasis>ifconfig</Emphasis> to configure the other parameters if necessary.
</Para>

<Para>
If you have any other interface type then you use the <Emphasis>ifconfig</Emphasis> program
to configure the ip address and netmask details for the port and add a route
via the port, just as you would for any other TCP/IP interface. The following
example is for a PI card device, but would work equally well for any other
AX.25 network device:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# /sbin/ifconfig pi0a 44.136.8.5 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
# /sbin/ifconfig pi0a broadcast 44.136.8.255 mtu 512
# /sbin/route add -net 44.136.8.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 pi0a
# /sbin/route add default pi0a
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
The commands listed above are typical of the sort of configuration many of
you would be familiar with if you have used NOS or any of its derivatives
or any other TCP/IP software. Note that the default route might not be required
in your configuration if you have some other network device configured.
</Para>

<Para>
To test it out, try a ping or a telnet to a local host.
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# ping -i 5 44.136.8.58
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
Note the use of the `<Literal>-i 5</Literal>' arguments to
<Emphasis>ping</Emphasis> to tell it to send pings every 5 seconds
instead of its default of 1 second.
</Para>

</Sect1>

<Sect1><Title>Configuring a NET/ROM port</Title>

<Para>
The NET/ROM protocol relies on, and uses the AX.25 ports you have created.
The NET/ROM protocol rides on top of the AX.25 protocol. To configure NET/ROM
on an AX.25 interface you must configure two files. One file describes the
NET/ROM interfaces, and the other file describes which of the AX.25 ports
will carry NET/ROM. You can configure multiple NET/ROM ports, each with its
own callsign and alias, the same procedure applies for each.
</Para>

<Sect2><Title>Configuring <Literal>/etc/ax25/nrports</Literal></Title>

<Para>
The first is the <Literal>/etc/ax25/nrports</Literal> file. This file describes
the NET/ROM ports in much the same way as the <Literal>/etc/ax25/axports</Literal>
file describes the AX.25 ports. Each NET/ROM device you wish to create
must have an entry in the <Literal>/etc/ax25/nrports</Literal> file. Normally
a Linux machine would have only one NET/ROM device configured that would
use a number of the AX.25 ports defined. In some situations you might
wish a special service such as a BBS to have a separate NET/ROM alias and
so you would create more than one.
</Para>

<Para>
This file is formatted as follows:

is the callsign that the NET/ROM traffic from this port will use. Note,
this is <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> that address that users should

interface. (The node program is covered later). This callsign/ssid
should be unique and should not appear elsewhere in either of the
<Literal>/etc/ax25/axports</Literal> or the
<Literal>/etc/ax25/nrports</Literal> files.

The second file is the <Literal>/etc/ax25/nrbroadcast</Literal> file. This file may

Where:
<VariableList>

<VarListEntry>
<Term>axport</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
is the port name obtained from the
<Literal>/etc/ax25/axports</Literal> file. If you do not have an entry in
<Literal>/etc/ax25/nrbroadcasts</Literal> for a port then this means that no NET/ROM
routing will occur and any received NET/ROM broadcasts will be ignored for that
port.

</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Creating the NET/ROM Network device</Title>

<Para>
When you have the two configuration files completed you must create
the NET/ROM device in much the same way as you did for the AX.25
devices. This time you use the <Emphasis>nrattach</Emphasis>
command. The <Emphasis>nrattach</Emphasis> works in just the same way
as the <Emphasis>axattach</Emphasis> command except that it creates
NET/ROM network devices called `<Literal>nr[0-9]</Literal>'. Again, the
first time you use the <Emphasis>nrattach</Emphasis> command it
creates the `<Literal>nr0</Literal>' device, the second time it
creates the `<Literal>nr1</Literal>' network devices etc. To create
the network device for the NET/ROM port we've defined we would use:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# nrattach netrom
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
This command would start the NET/ROM device (<Literal>nr0</Literal>)
named <Literal>netrom</Literal> configured with the details specified
in the <Literal>/etc/ax25/nrports</Literal> file.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Starting the NET/ROM daemon</Title>

<Para>
The Linux kernel does all of the NET/ROM protocol and switching, but does not
manage some functions. The NET/ROM daemon manages the NET/ROM routing tables
and generates the NET/ROM routing broadcasts. You start NET/ROM daemon with
the command:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# /usr/sbin/netromd -i
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
You should soon see the <Literal>/proc/net/nr_neigh</Literal> file filling up with
information about your NET/ROM neighbours.
</Para>

<Para>
Remember to put the <Literal>/usr/sbin/netromd</Literal> command in your
<Emphasis>rc</Emphasis> files so that it is started automatically each time you reboot.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Configuring NET/ROM routing. </Title>

<Para>
You may wish to configure static NET/ROM routes for specific hosts.
The <Emphasis>nrparms</Emphasis> command enables you to do
this. Again, the <Emphasis>man</Emphasis> page offers a complete
description, but a simple example might be:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# /usr/sbin/nrparms -nodes VK2XLZ-10 + #MINTO 120 5 radio VK2SUT-9
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
This command would set a NET/ROM route to <Literal>&num;MINTO:VK2XLZ-10</Literal> via a neighbour
<Literal>VK2SUT-9</Literal> on my AX.25 port called `<Literal>radio</Literal>'.
</Para>

<Para>
You can manually create entries for new neighbours using the <Emphasis>nrparms</Emphasis>
command as well. For example:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# /usr/sbin/nrparms -routes radio VK2SUT-9 + 120
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
This command would create <Literal>VK2SUT-9</Literal> as a NET/ROM neighbour with a quality
of <Literal>120</Literal> and this will be locked and will not be deleted automatically.
</Para>

</Sect2>

</Sect1>

<Sect1><Title>Configuring a NET/ROM interface for TCP/IP</Title>

<Para>
Configuring a NET/ROM interface for TCP/IP is almost identical to configuring
an AX.25 interface for TCP/IP.
</Para>

<Para>
Again you can either specify the ip address and mtu on the <Emphasis>nrattach</Emphasis>
command line, or use the <Emphasis>ifconfig</Emphasis> and <Emphasis>route</Emphasis> commands, but
you need to manually add <Emphasis>arp</Emphasis> entries for hosts you wish to route to
because there is no mechanism available for your machine to learn what
NET/ROM address it should use to reach a particular IP host.
</Para>

<Para>
So, to create an <Literal>nr0</Literal> device with an IP address of <Literal>44.136.8.5</Literal>,
an mtu of <Literal>512</Literal> and configured with the details from the
<Literal>/etc/ax25/nrports</Literal> file for a NET/ROM port named <Literal>netrom</Literal>
you would use:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# /usr/sbin/nrattach -i 44.136.8.5 -m 512 netrom
# route add 44.136.8.5 nr0
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
or you could use something like the following commands manually:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# /usr/sbin/nrattach netrom
# ifconfig nr0 44.136.8.5 netmask 255.255.255.0 hw netrom VK2KTJ-9
# route add 44.136.8.5 nr0
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
Then for each IP host you wish to reach via NET/ROM you need to set route and
arp entries. To reach a destination host with an IP address of
<Literal>44.136.80.4</Literal> at NET/ROM address <Literal>BBS:VK3BBS</Literal> via a NET/ROM
neighbour with callsign <Literal>VK2SUT-0</Literal> you would use commands as follows:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# route add 44.136.80.4 nr0
# arp -t netrom -s 44.136.80.4 vk2sut-0
# nrparms -nodes vk3bbs + BBS 120 6 sl0 vk2sut-0
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
The `<Literal>120</Literal>' and `<Literal>6</Literal>' arguments to
the <Emphasis>nrparms</Emphasis> command are the NET/ROM
<Emphasis>quality</Emphasis> and <Emphasis>obsolescence
count</Emphasis> values for the route.
</Para>

</Sect1>

<Sect1><Title>Configuring a ROSE port</Title>

<Para>
The ROSE packet layer protocol is similar to layer three of the X.25
specification. The kernel based ROSE support is a <Emphasis>modified</Emphasis> version of the
<ULink URL="http://fpac.lmi.ecp.fr/f1oat/f1oat.html">FPAC Rose implementation</ULink>.
</Para>

<Para>
The ROSE packet layer protocol protocol relies on, and uses the AX.25 ports
you have created. The ROSE protocol rides on top of the AX.25 protocol.
To configure ROSE you must create a configuration file that describes the
ROSE ports you want. You can create multiple ROSE ports if you wish, the same
procedure applies for each.
</Para>

<Sect2><Title>Configuring <Literal>/etc/ax25/rsports</Literal> </Title>

<Para>
The file where you configure your ROSE interfaces is the
<Literal>/etc/ax25/rsports</Literal> file. This file describes the ROSE port in much
the same way as the <Literal>/etc/ax25/axports</Literal> file describes the AX.25 ports.
</Para>

<Para>
This file is formatted as follows:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
name  address  description
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
Where:
<VariableList>

<VarListEntry>
<Term>name</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
is the text name that you wish to refer to the port by.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>address</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
is the 10 digit ROSE address you wish to assign to this port.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>description</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
is a free text description of the port.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
</VariableList>
</Para>

<Para>
An example would look something like the following:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
rose  5050294760  Rose Port
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
Note that ROSE will use the default callsign/ssid configured on each
AX.25 port unless you specify otherwise.
</Para>

<Para>
To configure a separate callsign/ssid for ROSE to use on each port you
use the <Emphasis>rsparms</Emphasis> command as follows:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# /usr/sbin/rsprams -call VK2KTJ-10
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
This example would make Linux listen for and use the callsign/ssid
<Literal>VK2KTJ-10</Literal> on all of the configured AX.25 ports for ROSE calls.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Creating the ROSE Network device</Title>

<Para>
When you have created the <Literal>/etc/ax25/rsports</Literal> file
you may create the ROSE device in much the same way as you did for the
AX.25 devices. This time you use the <Emphasis>rsattach</Emphasis>
command. The <Emphasis>rsattach</Emphasis> command creates network
devices named `<Literal>rose[0-5]</Literal>'. The first time you use
the <Emphasis>rsattach</Emphasis> command it create the
`<Literal>rose0</Literal>' device, the second time it creates the
`<Literal>rose1</Literal>' device etc. For example:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# rsattach rose
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
This command would start the ROSE device (<Literal>rose0</Literal>) configured with the
details specified in the <Literal>/etc/ax25/rsports</Literal> file for the entry
named `<Literal>rose</Literal>'.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Configuring ROSE Routing</Title>

<Para>
The ROSE protocol currently supports only static routing. The <Emphasis>rsparms</Emphasis>
utility allows you to configure your ROSE routing table under Linux.
</Para>

<Para>
For example:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# rsparms -nodes add 5050295502 radio vk2xlz
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
would add a route to ROSE node <Literal>5050295502</Literal> via an
AX.25 port named `<Literal>radio</Literal>' in your
<Literal>/etc/ax25/axports</Literal> file to a neighbour with the
callsign <Literal>VK2XLZ</Literal>.
</Para>

<Para>
You may specify a route with a mask to capture a number of ROSE destinations
into a single routing entry. The syntax looks like:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# rsparms -nodes add 5050295502/4 radio vk2xlz
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
which would be identical to the previous example except that it would match
any destination address that matched the first four digits supplied, in this
case any address commencing with the digits <Literal>5050</Literal>. An alternate form
for this command is:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# rsparms -nodes add 5050/4 radio vk2xlz
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
which is probably the less ambiguous form.
</Para>
</Sect2>

</Sect1>

<Sect1><Title>Making AX.25/NET/ROM/ROSE calls</Title>

<Para>
Now that you have all of your AX.25, NET/ROM and ROSE interfaces configured
and active, you should be able to make test calls.
</Para>

<Para>
The AX.25 Utilities package includes a program called `<Emphasis>call</Emphasis>' which
is a split screen terminal program for AX.25, NET/ROM and ROSE.
</Para>

<Para>
A simple AX.25 call would look like:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
/usr/bin/call radio VK2DAY via VK2SUT
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
A simple NET/ROM call to a node with an alias of <Literal>SUNBBS</Literal> would look like:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
/usr/bin/call netrom SUNBBS
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
A simple ROSE call to <Literal>HEARD</Literal> at node
<Literal>5050882960</Literal> would look like:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
/usr/bin/call rose HEARD 5050882960
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
Note: you must tell <Emphasis>call</Emphasis> which port you wish to
make the call on, as the same destination node might be reachable on
any of the ports you have configured.
</Para>

<Para>
The <Emphasis>call</Emphasis> program is a line mode terminal program for making
AX.25 calls. It recognizes lines that start with `<Literal>&tilde;</Literal>' as command lines.
The `<Literal>&tilde;.</Literal>' command will close the connection.
</Para>

<Para>
Please refer to the man page in <Literal>/usr/man</Literal> for more information.

</Sect1>

<Sect1><Title>Configuring Linux to accept Packet connections</Title>

<Para>
Linux is a powerful operating system and offers a great deal of flexibility
in how it is configured. With this flexibility comes a cost in configuring
it to do what you want. When configuring your Linux machine to accept incoming
AX.25, NET/ROM or ROSE connections there are a number of questions you need to
ask yourself. The most important of which is: "What do I want users to see when
they connect?". People are developing neat little applications that may be
used to provide services to callers, a simple example is the <Emphasis>pms</Emphasis> program
included in the AX.25 utilities, a more complex example is the <Emphasis>node</Emphasis> program
also included in the AX.25 utilities. Alternatively you might want to give
users a login prompt so that they can make use of a shell account, or you
might even have written your own program, such as a customized database or a
game, that you want people to connect to. Whatever you choose, you must tell
the AX.25 software about this so that it knows what software to run when it
accepts an incoming AX.25 connection.
</Para>

<Para>
The <Emphasis>ax25d</Emphasis> program is similar to the <Emphasis>inetd</Emphasis> program commonly used
to accept incoming TCP/IP connections on UNIX machines. It sits and listens
for incoming connections, when it detects one it goes away and checks a
configuration file to determine what program to run and connect to that
connection. Since this the standard tool for accepting incoming AX.25, NET/ROM
and ROSE connections I'll describe how to configure it.
</Para>

<Sect2><Title>Creating the <Literal>/etc/ax25/ax25d.conf</Literal> file</Title>

<Para>
This file is the configuration file for the <Emphasis>ax25d</Emphasis> AX.25 daemon which
handles incoming AX.25, NET/ROM and ROSE connections.
</Para>

<Para>
The file is a little cryptic looking at first, but you'll soon discover
it is very simple in practice, with a small trap for you to be wary of.
</Para>

<Para>
The general format of the <Literal>ax25d.conf</Literal> file is as follows:
</Para>

<Para>
You need one section in the above format for each AX.25, NET/ROM or ROSE
interface you want to accept incoming AX.25, NET/ROM or ROSE connections on.
</Para>

<Para>
There are two special lines in the paragraph, one starts with the string
`<Literal>parameters</Literal>' and the other starts with the string `<Literal>default</Literal>'
(yes there is a difference). These lines serve special functions.
</Para>

<Para>
The `<Literal>default</Literal>' lines purpose should be obvious, this line acts as a
catch-all, so that any incoming connection on the &lt;interface_call&gt;
interface that doesn't have a specific rule will match the `<Literal>default</Literal>'
rule. If you don't have a `<Literal>default</Literal>' rule, then any connections not
matching any specific rule will be disconnected immediately without notice.
</Para>

<Para>
The `<Literal>parameters</Literal>' line is a little more subtle, and
here is the trap I mentioned earlier. In any of the fields for any
definition for a peer you can use the `*' character to say `use the
default value'. The `<Literal>parameters</Literal>' line is what sets
those default values. The kernel software itself has some defaults
which will be used if you don't specify any using the
`<Literal>parameters</Literal>' entry. The trap is that the these
defaults apply <Emphasis>only</Emphasis> to those rules
<Emphasis>below</Emphasis> the `<Literal>parameters</Literal>' line,
not to those above. You may have more than one
`<Literal>parameters</Literal>' rule per interface definition, and in
this way you may create groups of default configurations. It is
important to note that the `<Literal>parameters</Literal>' rule does
not allow you to set the `<Literal>uid</Literal>' or
`<Literal>command</Literal>' fields.
</Para>

</Para>

<Para>
This example says that anybody attempting to connect to the callsign
`<Literal>VK2KTJ-0</Literal>' heard on the AX.25 port called `<Literal>radio</Literal>' will have
the following rules applied:
</Para>

<Para>
Anyone whose callsign is set to `NOCALL' should be locked out, note the
use of mode `L'.
</Para>

<Para>
The <Literal>parameters</Literal> line changes two parameters from the
kernel defaults (Window and T1) and will run the
<Emphasis>/usr/sbin/axspawn</Emphasis> program for them. Any copies of
<Emphasis>/usr/sbin/axspawn</Emphasis> run this way will appear as
<Emphasis>axspawn</Emphasis> in a <Emphasis>ps</Emphasis> listing for
convenience. The next two lines provide definitions for two stations
who will receive those permissions.
</Para>

<Para>
The last line in the paragraph is the `catch all' definition that everybody
else will get (including VK2XLZ and VK2DAY using any other SSID other than -1).
This definition sets all of the parameters implicitly and will cause the
<Emphasis>pms</Emphasis> program to be run with a command line argument indicating that
it is being run for an AX.25 connection, and that the owner callsign is
<Literal>VK2KTJ</Literal>. (See the `Configuring the PMS' section below for more details).
</Para>

<Para>
The next configuration accepts calls to <Literal>VK2KTJ-1</Literal>
via the <Literal>radio</Literal> port. It runs the
<Emphasis>node</Emphasis> program for everybody that connects to it.
</Para>

<Para>
The next configuration is a NET/ROM configuration, note the use of the
greater-then and less-than braces instead of the square brackets. These
denote a NET/ROM configuration. This configuration is simpler, it simply
says that anyone connecting to our NET/ROM port called `<Literal>netrom</Literal>' will
have the <Emphasis>node</Emphasis> program run for them, unless they have a callsign of
`<Literal>NOCALL</Literal>' in which case they will be locked out.
</Para>

<Para>
The last two configurations are for incoming ROSE connections. The first
for people who have placed calls to `<Literal>vk2ktj-0</Literal>' and the second for
`<Literal>VK2KTJ-1</Literal> at the our ROSE node address. These work precisely the same
way. Not the use of the curly braces to distinguish the port as a ROSE
port.
</Para>

<Para>
This example is a contrived one but I think it illustrates clearly the
important features of the syntax of the configuration file. The
configuration file is explained fully in the
<Literal>ax25d.conf</Literal> <Emphasis>man</Emphasis> page. A more
detailed example is included in the <Literal>ax25-utils</Literal>
package that might be useful to you too.

When you have the two configuration files completed you start <Emphasis>ax25d</Emphasis>
with the command:
</Para>

<Para>

</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
When this is run people should be able to make AX.25 connections to

</Para>

</Sect2>

</Sect1>

<Sect1><Title>Configuring the <Emphasis>node</Emphasis> software</Title>

<Para>
The <Emphasis>node</Emphasis> software was developed by
<ULink URL="mailto:tomi.manninen@hut.fi">Tomi Manninen</ULink>
and was based on the original PMS program. It provides a fairly
complete and flexible node capability that is easily configured. It
allows users once they are connected to make Telnet, NET/ROM, ROSE, and
AX.25 connections out and to obtain various sorts of information such
as Finger, Nodes and Heard lists etc. You can configure the node to
execute any Linux command you wish fairly simply.
</Para>

<Para>
The node would normally be invoked from the <Emphasis>ax25d</Emphasis>

<Sect2><Title>Creating the <Literal>/etc/ax25/node.perms</Literal> file</Title>

<Para>
The <Emphasis>node</Emphasis> allows you to assign permissions to users. These permissions
allow you to determine which users should be allowed to make use of options
such as the (T)elnet, and (C)onnect commands, for example, and which
shouldn't. The <Literal>node.perms</Literal> file is where this information is stored
and contains five key fields. For all fields an asterisk `*'
character matches anything. This is useful for building default rules.
</Para>

<Para>
<VariableList>

<VarListEntry>
<Term>user</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
The first field is the callsign or user to which the permissions should apply.
Any SSID value is ignored, so you should just place the base callsign here.

Each protocol or access method is also given permissions. For example you
might allow users who have connected via AX.25 or NET/ROM to use the (C)onnect
option, but prevent others, such as those who are telnet connected from a
non-local node from having access to it. The second field therefore allows
you to select which access method this permissions rule should apply to.
The access methods allowed are:

<Sect2><Title>Configuring <Emphasis>node</Emphasis> to run from <Emphasis>ax25d</Emphasis></Title>

<Para>
The <Emphasis>node</Emphasis> program would normally be run by the
<Emphasis>ax25d</Emphasis> program. To do this you need to add
appropriate rules to the <Literal>/etc/ax25/ax25d.conf</Literal>
file. In my configuration I wanted users to have a choice of either
connecting to the <Emphasis>node</Emphasis> or connecting to other
services. <Emphasis>ax25d</Emphasis> allows you to do this by cleverly
creating port aliases. For example, given the
<Emphasis>ax25d</Emphasis> configuration presented above, I want to
configure <Emphasis>node</Emphasis> so that all users who connect to
<Literal>VK2KTJ-1</Literal> are given the node. To do this I add the
following to my <Literal>/etc/ax25/ax25d.conf</Literal> file:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
[vk2ktj-1 via radio]
default    *     *    *   *   *   0    root /usr/sbin/node node
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
This says that the Linux kernel code will answer any connection
requests for the callsign `<Literal>VK2KTJ-1</Literal>' heard on the
AX.25 port named `<Literal>radio</Literal>', and will cause the
<Emphasis>node</Emphasis> program to be run.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Configuring <Emphasis>node</Emphasis> to run from <Emphasis>inetd</Emphasis></Title>

<Para>
If you want users to be able to telnet a port on your machine and obtain
access to the <Emphasis>node</Emphasis> you can go this fairly easily. The first thing
to decide is what port users should connect to. In this example I've
arbitrarily chosen port 4000, though Tomi gives details on how you could
replace the normal telnet daemon with the <Emphasis>node</Emphasis> in his documentation.
</Para>

<Para>
You need to modify two files.
</Para>

<Para>
To <Literal>/etc/services</Literal> you should add:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
node	3694/tcp	#OH2BNS's node software
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
and to <Literal>/etc/inetd.conf</Literal> you should add:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
node	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/sbin/node node
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
When this is done, and you have restarted the <Emphasis>inetd</Emphasis> program any user
who telnet connects to port 3694 of your machine will be prompted to login
and if configured, their password and then they will be connected to the
<Emphasis>node</Emphasis>.
</Para>

</Sect2>

</Sect1>

<Sect1><Title>Configuring <Emphasis>axspawn</Emphasis></Title>

<Para>
The <Emphasis>axspawn</Emphasis> program is a simple program that
allows AX.25 stations who connect to be logged in to your machine. It
may be invoked from the <Emphasis>ax25d</Emphasis> program as
described above in a manner similar to the <Emphasis>node</Emphasis>
program. To allow a user to log in to your machine you should add a
line similar to the following into your
<Literal>/etc/ax25/ax25d.conf</Literal> file:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
default * * * * * 1 root /usr/sbin/axspawn axspawn %u
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
If the line ends in the <Literal>+</Literal> character then the connecting user must
hit return before they will be allowed to login. The default is to not wait.
Any individual host configurations that follow this line will have the
<Emphasis>axspawn</Emphasis> program run when they connect. When <Emphasis>axspawn</Emphasis> is
run it first checks that the command line argument it is supplied is a legal
callsign, strips the SSID, then it checks that <Literal>/etc/passwd</Literal> file to
see if that user has an account configured. If there is an account, and the
password is either <Literal>""</Literal> (null) or <Literal>+</Literal> then the user is logged
in, if there is anything in the password field the user is prompted to enter
a password. If there is not an existing account in the <Literal>/etc/passwd</Literal>
file then <Emphasis>axspawn</Emphasis> may be configured to automatically create one.
</Para>

<Sect2><Title>Creating the <Literal>/etc/ax25/axspawn.conf</Literal> file</Title>

<Para>
You can alter the behaviour of <Emphasis>axspawn</Emphasis> in various ways by use of
the <Literal>/etc/ax25/axspawn.conf</Literal> file. This file is formatted as
follows:

<Sect1><Title>Configuring the <Emphasis>pms</Emphasis></Title>

<Para>
The <Emphasis>pms</Emphasis> program is an implementation of a simple personal message
system. It was originally written by Alan Cox.
<ULink URL="mailto:dcb@vectorbd.com">Dave Brown</ULink>, N2RJT,
has taken on further development of it. At present it is still very
simple, supporting only the ability to send mail to the owner of the
system and to obtain some limited system information but Dave is
working to expand its capability to make it more useful.
</Para>

<Para>
After that is done there are a couple of simple files that you should create
that give users some information about the system and then you need to add
appropriate entries into the <Literal>ax25d.conf</Literal> file so that connected users
are presented with the PMS.
</Para>

<Sect2><Title>Create the <Literal>/etc/ax25/pms.motd</Literal> file</Title>

<Para>
The <Literal>/etc/ax25/pms.motd</Literal> file contains the `message of the day' that
users will be presented with after they connect and receive the usual BBS
id header. The file is a simple text file, any text you include in this file
will be sent to users.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Create the <Literal>/etc/ax25/pms.info</Literal> file</Title>

<Para>
The <Literal>/etc/ax25/pms.info</Literal> file is also a simple text file in which
you would put more detailed information about your station or configuration.
This file is presented to users in response to their issuing of the
<Literal>Info</Literal> command from the <Literal>PMS&gt;</Literal> prompt.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Associate AX.25 callsigns with system users</Title>

<Para>
When a connected user sends mail to an AX.25 callsign, the <Emphasis>pms</Emphasis> expects
that callsign to be mapped, or associated with a real system user on your
machine. This is described in a section of its own.
</Para>
</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Add the PMS to the <Literal>/etc/ax25/ax25d.conf</Literal> file</Title>

<Para>
Adding the <Emphasis>pms</Emphasis> to your <Literal>ax25d.conf</Literal> file is very simple.
There is one small thing you need to think about though. Dave has added command
line arguments to the PMS to allow it to handle a number of different text
end-of-line conventions. AX.25 and NET/ROM by convention expect the end-of-line
to be <Emphasis>carriage return, linefeed</Emphasis> while the standard UNIX end-of-line is
just <Emphasis>newline</Emphasis>. So, for example, if you wanted to add an entry that
meant that the default action for a connection received on an AX.25 port is
to start the PMS then you would add a line that looked something like:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
default  1  10 5 100 5   0    root  /usr/sbin/pms pms -a -o vk2ktj
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
This simply runs the <Emphasis>pms</Emphasis> program, telling it that it is an AX.25
connection it is connected to and that the PMS owner is <Literal>vk2ktj</Literal>.
Check the <Emphasis>man</Emphasis> page for what you should specify for other connection
methods.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Test the PMS</Title>

<Para>
To test the PMS, you can try the following command from the command line:
# /usr/sbin/pms -u vk2ktj -o vk2ktj
Substitute your own callsign for mine and this will run the pms, telling it
that it is to use the UNIX end-of-line convention, and that user logging in
is <Literal>vk2ktj</Literal>. You can do all the things connected users can.
</Para>

<Para>
Additionally you might try getting some other node to connect to you to
confirm that your <Literal>ax25d.conf</Literal> configuration works.
</Para>

</Sect2>

</Sect1>

<Sect1><Title>Configuring the <Emphasis>user_call</Emphasis> programs</Title>

<Para>
The `<Emphasis>user_call</Emphasis>' programs are really called:
<Emphasis>ax25_call</Emphasis> and
<Emphasis>netrom_call</Emphasis>. They are very simple programs
designed to be called from <Emphasis>ax25d</Emphasis> to automate
network connections to remote hosts. They may of course be called from
a number of other places such as shell scripts or other daemons such
as the <Emphasis>node</Emphasis> program.
</Para>

<Para>
They are like a very simple <Emphasis>call</Emphasis> program. They don't do any meddling
with the data at all, so the end of line handling you'll have to worry about
yourself.
</Para>

<Para>
Let's start with an example of how you might use them. Imagine you have
a small network at home and that you have one linux machine acting as your
Linux radio gateway and another machine, lets say a BPQ node connected to it
via an ethernet connection.
</Para>

<Para>
Normally if you wanted radio users to be able to connect
to the BPQ node they would either have to digipeat through your linux node,
or connect to the node program on your linux node and then connect from it.
The <Emphasis>ax25_call</Emphasis> program can simplify this if it is called from the
<Emphasis>ax25d</Emphasis> program.
</Para>

<Para>
Imagine the BPQ node has the callsign <Literal>VK2KTJ-9</Literal> and that the linux
machine has the AX.25/ethernet port named `<Literal>bpq</Literal>'. Let us also imagine
the Linux gateway machine has a radio port called `<Literal>radio</Literal>'.
</Para>

<Para>
An entry in the <Literal>/etc/ax25/ax25d.conf</Literal> that looked like:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
[VK2KTJ-1 via radio]
default    * * * *   *   *  *
		root /usr/sbin/ax25_call ax25_call bpq %u vk2ktj-9
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
would enable users to connect direct to `<Literal>VK2KTJ-1</Literal>'
which would actually be the Linux <Emphasis>ax25d</Emphasis> daemon
and then be automatically switched to an AX.25 connection to
`<Literal>VK2KTJ-9</Literal>' via the `<Literal>bpq</Literal>'
interface.
</Para>

<Para>
There are all sorts of other possible configurations that you might try.
The `<Emphasis>netrom_call</Emphasis>' and `<Emphasis>rose_call</Emphasis>' utilities work in
similar ways. One amateur has used this utility to make connections to a
remote BBS easier. Normally the users would have to manually enter a long
connection string to make the call so he created an entry that made the BBS
appear as though it were on the local network by having his <Emphasis>ax25d</Emphasis> proxy
the connection to the remote machine.
</Para>

</Sect1>

<Sect1><Title>Configuring the ROSE Uplink and Downlink commands</Title>

<Para>
If you are familiar with the ROM based ROSE implementation you will be
familiar with the method by which AX.25 users make calls across a ROSE
network. If a users local ROSE node has the callsign <Literal>VK2KTJ-5</Literal> and
the AX.25 user wants to connect to <Literal>VK5XXX</Literal> at remote ROSE node
<Literal>5050882960</Literal> then they would issue the command:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
c vk5xxx v vk2ktj-5 5050 882960
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
At the remote node, <Literal>VK5XXX</Literal> would see an incoming connection with the
local AX.25 users callsign and being digipeated via the remote ROSE nodes
callsign.
</Para>

<Para>
The Linux ROSE implementation does not support this capability in the
kernel, but there are two application programs called
<Emphasis>rsuplnk</Emphasis> and <Emphasis>rsdwnlnk</Emphasis> which
perform this function.
</Para>

<Sect2><Title>Configuring a ROSE downlink</Title>

<Para>
To configure your Linux machine to accept a ROSE connection and establish an
AX.25 connection to any destination callsign that is not being listened for
on your machine you need to add an entry to your <Literal>/etc/ax25/ax25d.conf</Literal>
file. Normally you would configure this entry to be the default behaviour for
incoming ROSE connections. For example you might have ROSE listeners operating
for destinations like <Literal>NODE-0</Literal> or <Literal>HEARD-0</Literal> that you wish to handle
locally, but for all other destination calls you may want to pass them to
the <Emphasis>rsdwnlink</Emphasis> command and assume they are AX.25 users.
</Para>

<Para>
A typical configuration would look like:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
#
{* via rose}
NOCALL   * * * * * *  L
default  * * * * * *  - root  /usr/sbin/rsdwnlnk rsdwnlnk 4800 vk2ktj-5
#
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
With this configuration any user who established a ROSE connection to your
Linux nodes address with a destination call of something that you were not
specifically listening for would be converted into an AX.25 connection on the
AX.25 port named <Literal>4800</Literal> with a digipeater path of <Literal>VK2KTJ-5</Literal>.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Configuring a ROSE uplink</Title>

<Para>
To configure your Linux machine to accept AX.25 connections in the same way
that a ROM ROSE node would you must add an entry into your
<Literal>/etc/ax25/ax25d.conf</Literal> file that looks similar to the following:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
#
[VK2KTJ-5* via 4800]
NOCALL   * * * * * *  L
default  * * * * * *  - root  /usr/sbin/rsuplnk rsuplnk rose
#
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
Note the special syntax for the local callsign. The `<Literal>*</Literal>' character
indicates that the application should be invoked if the callsign is heard in
the digipeater path of a connection.
</Para>

<Para>
This configuration would allow an AX.25 user to establish ROSE calls
using the example connect sequence presented in the
introduction. Anybody attempting to digipeat via
<Literal>VK2KTJ-5</Literal> on the AX.25 port named
<Literal>4800</Literal> would be handled by the
<Emphasis>rsuplnk</Emphasis> command.
</Para>

</Sect2>

</Sect1>

<Sect1><Title>Associating AX.25 callsigns with Linux users</Title>

<Para>
There are a number of situations where it is highly desirable to associate
a callsign with a linux user account. One example might be where a number of
amateur radio operators share the same linux machine and wish to use their
own callsign when making calls. Another is the case of PMS users wanting to
talk to a particular user on your machine.
</Para>

<Para>
The AX.25 software provides a means of managing this association of linux
user account names with callsigns. We've mentioned it once already in the PMS
section, but I'm spelling it out here to be sure you don't miss it.
</Para>

<Para>
You make the association with the <Emphasis>axparms</Emphasis> command. An example looks
like:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# axparms -assoc vk2ktj terry
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
This command associates that AX.25 callsign <Literal>vk2ktj</Literal> with the user
<Literal>terry</Literal> on the machine. So, for example, any mail for <Literal>vk2ktj</Literal>
on the <Emphasis>pms</Emphasis> will be sent to Linux account <Literal>terry</Literal>.
</Para>

<Para>
Remember to put these associations into your <Emphasis>rc</Emphasis> file so that they
are available each time your reboot.

<Sect1><Title>AX.25, NET/ROM, ROSE network programming</Title>

<Para>
Probably the biggest advantage of using the kernel based implementations of
the amateur packet radio protocols is the ease with which you can develop
applications and programs to use them.
</Para>

<Para>
While the subject of Unix Network Programming is outside the scope of this
document I will describe the elementary details of how you can make use of
the AX.25, NET/ROM and ROSE protocols within your software.
</Para>

<Sect2><Title>The address families</Title>

<Para>
Network programming for AX.25, NET/ROM and ROSE is quite similar to programming
for TCP/IP under Linux. The major differences being the address families used,
and the address structures that need to be mangled into place.
</Para>

<Para>
The address family names for AX.25, NET/ROM and ROSE are <Literal>AF_AX25</Literal>,
<Literal>AF_NETROM</Literal> and <Literal>AF_ROSE</Literal> respectively.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>The header files</Title>

<Para>
You must always include the `<Literal>netax25/ax25.h</Literal>' header
file, and also the `<Literal>netrom/netrom.h</Literal>' or
`<Literal>netrose/rose.h</Literal>' header files if you are dealing
with those protocols. Simple top level skeletons would look something
like the following:
</Para>

<Para>
For AX.25:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
#include &lt;netax25/ax25.h&gt;
int s, addrlen = sizeof(struct full_sockaddr_ax25);
struct full_sockaddr_ax25 sockaddr;

<Sect2><Title>Callsign mangling and examples</Title>

<Para>
There are routines within the <Literal>lib/ax25.a</Literal> library built in the
AX.25 utilities package that manage the callsign conversions for you. You can
write your own of course if you wish.
</Para>

<Para>
The <Emphasis>user_call</Emphasis> utilities are excellent examples from which to
work. The source code for them is included in the AX.25 utilities package.
If you spend a little time working with those you will soon see that
ninety percent of the work is involved in just getting ready to open the
socket. Actually making the connection is easy, the preparation takes time.
</Para>

<Para>
The examples are simple enough to not be very confusing. If you have any
questions, you should feel to direct them to the <Literal>linux-hams</Literal> mailing
list and someone there will be sure to help you.

<Sect2><Title>Small Ethernet LAN with Linux as a router to Radio LAN</Title>

<Para>
Many of you may have small local area networks at home and want to
connect the machines on that network to your local radio LAN. This is
the type of configuration I use at home. I arranged to have a suitable
block of addresses allocated to me that I could capture in a single route
for convenience and I use these on my Ethernet LAN. Your local IP coordinator
will assist you in doing this if you want to try it as well. The addresses
for the Ethernet LAN form a subset of the radio LAN addresses. The following
configuration is the actual one for my linux router on my network at home:

<Para>
The configuration file for this example is the following:
</Para>

<Para>
<Screen>
# /etc/rc.d/rc.tunnel
# This file is a simple configuration that provides the IPIP encapsulation,
# commonly used when utilising the ampr.org (44.0.0.0/8) routing via UCSD.
# The script is located on IPIP gateway with eth0 interface, connected directly
# to the internet and other (e.g. sl0) interface, connected to packet radio
# subnet, e.g. 44.177.155/24.
#
IP_eth0=x.x.x.x
IP_eth1=y.y.y.y
echo "  Configuring:"
#
ip tunnel add ucsd remote $IP_eth1 mode ipip
# 'ucsd' is (any suitable) tunnel name
ifconfig ucsd $IP_eth0 up
# tunnel initialisation
ip route add 44/8 dev ucsd via $IP_eth1 onlink
# tells that tunnel should be used when sending packets to ampr.org network
# onlink is the magic word, do not forget
echo " done."
#
# end.
</Screen>
</Para>

<Para>
In any case, the tunnel must be set up on both sides of the route.
The tunnelling interface configured above is used for both
encapsulation and decapsulation. However, the same principle can be
used for one of those tasks, exclusively. When needed, the standard
routing (via UCSD), used in previous example, can be avoided by
setting the IPIP tunneling between two PR stations, where only one of
them has its own internet (public) non-ampr IP address. The task is
then to set up the one-way IPIP tunnel, to achieve a quicker and more
stable route from non-ampr IP address to ampr IP address station. In
this case, the setup, mentioned above, is used for encapsulation. The
other side of the route can leave out the route setting, due to its
pure decapsulation task.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>AXIP encapsulated gateway configuration</Title>

<Para>
Many Amateur Radio Internet gateways encapsulate AX.25, NET/ROM and ROSE in
addition to tcp/ip. Encapsulation of AX.25 frames within IP datagrams is
described in RFC-1226 by Brian Kantor. Mike Westerhof wrote an implementation
of an AX.25 encapsulation daemon for UNIX in 1991. The ax25-utils package
includes a marginally enhanced version of it for Linux.
</Para>

<Para>
An AXIP encapsulation program accepts AX.25 frames at one end, looks at the
destination AX.25 address to determine what IP address to send them to,
encapsulates them in a tcp/ip datagram and then transmits them to
the appropriate remote destination. It also accepts tcp/ip datagrams
that contain AX.25 frames, unwraps them and processes them as if it had
received them directly from an AX.25 port. To distinguish IP datagrams
containing AX.25 frames from other IP datagrams which don't, AXIP datagrams
are coded with a protocol id of 4 (or 94 which is now deprecated). This
process is described in RFC-1226.
</Para>

<Para>
The <Emphasis>ax25ipd</Emphasis> program included in the ax25-utils package presents itself
as a program supporting a KISS interface across which you pass AX.25 frames,
and an interface into the tcp/ip protocols. It is configured with a single
configuration file called <Literal>/etc/ax25/ax25ipd.conf</Literal>.
</Para>

<Sect3><Title>AXIP configuration options</Title>

<Para>
The <Emphasis>ax25ipd</Emphasis> program has two major modes of operation. "digipeater"
mode and "tnc" mode. In "tnc" mode the daemon is treated as though it
were a kiss TNC, you pass KISS encapsulated frames to it and it will
transmit them, this is the usual configuration. In "digipeater" mode, you
treat the daemon as though it were an AX.25 digipeater. There are subtle
differences between these modes.
</Para>

<Para>
In the configuration file you configure "routes" or mappings between
destination AX.25 callsigns and the IP addresses of the hosts that you
want to send the AX.25 packets too. Each route has options which will be
explained later.
</Para>

<Para>
Other options that are configured here are:

whether you want to encapsulate the AX.25 frames in IP datagrams or in
UDP/IP datagrams. Nearly all AXIP gateways use IP encapsulation, but some
gateways are behind firewalls that will not allow IP with the AXIP protocol id
to pass and are forced to use UDP/IP. Whatever you choose must match
what the tcp/ip host at the other end of the link is using.

<Sect3><Title>Some notes about the routes and route flags</Title>

<Para>
The "<Literal>route</Literal>" command is where you specify where you want your AX.25
packets encapsulated and sent to. When the <Emphasis>ax25ipd</Emphasis> daemon receives
a packet from its interface, it compares the destination callsign with each
of the callsigns in its routing table. If it finds a match then the ax.25
packet is encapsulated in an IP datagram and then transmitted to the host
at the specified IP address.
</Para>

<Para>
There are two flags you can add to any of the route commands in the
<Literal>ax25ipd.conf</Literal> file. The two flags are:

Since both Linux and NOS support the slip protocol it is possible to link
the two together by creating a slip link. You could do this by using two
serial ports with a loopback cable between them, but this would be slow
and costly. Linux provides a feature that many other Unix-like operating
systems provide called `pipes'. These are special pseudo devices that
look like a standard tty device to software but in fact loopback to another
pipe device. To use these pipes the first program must open the <Emphasis>master</Emphasis>
end of the pipe, and the open then the second program can open the
<Emphasis>slave</Emphasis> end of the pipe. When both ends are open the programs can
communicate with each other simply by writing characters to the pipes in the
way they would if they were terminal devices.
</Para>

<Para>
To use this feature to connect the Linux Kernel and a copy of NOS, or some
other program you first must choose a pipe device to use. You can find one
by looking in your <Literal>/dev</Literal> directory. The master end of the pipes are
named: <Literal>ptyq[1-f]</Literal> and the slave end of the pipes are known as:
<Literal>ttyq[1-f]</Literal>. Remember they come in pairs, so if you select
<Literal>/dev/ptyqf</Literal> as your master end then you must use <Literal>/dev/ttyqf</Literal>
as the slave end.
</Para>

<Para>
Once you have chosen a pipe device pair to use you should allocate the master
end to you linux kernel and the slave end to the NOS program, as the Linux
kernel starts first and the master end of the pipe must be opened first.
You must also remember that your Linux kernel must have a different IP address
to your NOS, so you will need to allocate a unique address for it if you
haven't already.
</Para>

<Para>
You configure the pipe just as if it were a serial device, so to create
the slip link from your linux kernel you can use commands similar to the
following:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
# /sbin/slattach -s 38400 -p slip /dev/ptyqf &#38;
# /sbin/ifconfig sl0 broadcast 44.255.255.255 pointopoint 44.70.248.67 /
	mtu 1536 44.70.4.88
# /sbin/route add 44.70.248.67 sl0
# /sbin/route add -net 44.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 gw 44.70.248.67
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
In this example the Linux kernel has been given IP address <Literal>44.70.4.88</Literal>
and the NOS program is using IP address <Literal>44.70.248.67</Literal>. The
<Emphasis>route</Emphasis> command in the last line simply tells your linux kernel to route
all datagrams for the amprnet via the slip link created by the
<Emphasis>slattach</Emphasis> command. Normally you would put these commands into your
<Literal>/etc/rc.d/rc.inet2</Literal> file after all your other network configuration
is complete so that the slip link is created automatically when you reboot.
Note: there is no advantage in using <Emphasis>cslip</Emphasis> instead of <Emphasis>slip</Emphasis>
as it actually reduces performance because the link is only a virtual
one and occurs fast enough that having to compress the headers first takes
longer than transmitting the uncompressed datagram.
</Para>

<Para>
To configure the NOS end of the link you could try the following:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
# you can call the interface anything you want; I use "linux" for convenience.
attach asy ttyqf - slip linux 1024 1024 38400
route addprivate 44.70.4.88 linux
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
These commands will create a slip port named `linux' via the slave end of
the pipe device pair to your linux kernel, and a route to it to make it
work. When you have started NOS you should be able to ping and telnet to
your NOS from your Linux machine and vice versa. If not, double check that
you have made no mistakes especially that you have the addresses configured
properly and have the pipe devices around the right way.
