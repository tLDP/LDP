<para>
      This miniHOWTO is about how to get the OpenGL/GLX Linux QuakeWorld
      client compiled and working on systems with standard OpenGL hardware
      acceleration support.
</para>

<para>
      This procedure was developed while struggling to get glqwcl.glx
      to work on a system with Linux Slackware 7.0 (2.2.16), XFree86
      4.0.1, a GeForce 256 DDR video card, and NVIDIA's 0.9-4 MesaGL
      drop-in replacement lib/driver (libGL.so.1.0.4).

 <title>The Procedure</title>

<para>
It seems that the glqwcl.glx binary available at least 
at <ulink url="http://www.quakeworld.net/">www.quakeworld.net</ulink>
in the package <filename>qwcl-2.30-glibc-i386-unknown-linux2.0.tar.gz</filename> 
is not compiled properly since on startup, it looks 
for <filename>libglide2x.so</filename>.
</para>

<para>
QuakeWorld clients come in several flavors:

<para>
   Again, this miniHOWTO is about getting the glqwcl.glx working with
   XFree86 4.x DRI.
</para>

<para>
<orderedlist>

 <listitem>
     <para>
        Download the Quake source code, q1source.zip, from
	<ulink url="ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/source/q1source.zip">ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/source/q1source.zip</ulink>.
	This zip file contains all versions of Quake1/QuakeWorld.
     </para>
     <para>
	After compiling, you will get version:
        <screen>

	LinuxGL (0.98) QuakeWorld 2.40 (as of this writing, Aug 19, 2000)
        </screen>
     </para>
	
     <para>
	You will also need to download the Mesa 3D Library source code from
	<ulink url="http://mesa3d.sourceforge.net/">http://mesa3d.sourceforge.net/</ulink>.
        MesaLib-3.3.tar.gz is good.
        <screen>

	cd /usr/src
	tar -xvzf MesaLib-3.3.tar.gz

	<emphasis>This puts the mesa source at /usr/src/Mesa-3.3</emphasis>
        </screen>
     </para>

     <para>
	Build the mesa source code:
        <screen>

	cd /usr/src/Mesa-3.3
	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make
        </screen>
     </para>
	
     <para>
	Depending on your setup, you might not need to actually install Mesa.
	If you are going to install Mesa, be aware that Mesa will install over
	the libGL.* files you already have in /usr/lib.  Those libGL.* files
	are likely to be your hardware accelerated versions.  Installing Mesa
	will also overwrite the glx include files in /usr/X11R6/include/GL.
	Therefore, before you install Mesa, make a backup of /usr/lib/libGL.*
	and /usr/X11R6/include/GL/glx*.h.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	To install it:
        <screen>

	make install
        </screen>
     </para>
       
     <para>
	After you install the full Mesa package, you might need to reinstall
	your hardware accelerated libGL files or restore the backup suggested
	above.  You also need to restore the glx include files.  You can
	restore the glx include files either by restoring the files that
	you backed up as suggested above, or if you have the source to X
	still lying around, then you can copy the include files from
	the source: cp xc/include/GL/*.h /usr/X11R6/include/GL
	</para>

	<para>
	By installing the Mesa libs, you will get the libGLU* files and
	associated include files installed on your system.  XFree86 4.0.1
	appeared to be lacking libGLU* and its include files.  GLU, the
	OpenGL Utility library is a standard part of a normal OpenGL
	installation that is missing from XFree86 4 and may not come with
	vendor-specific OpenGL drivers either.
	</para>
	
     <para>
	XFree86 4.0.1 appears to have included only the core of Mesa 3.3,
	which at the time was/is a development version of MesaGL.  The
	direct rendering infrusture (DRI) of XFree86 is based on Mesa code.
     </para>

     <para>
	If you happen to have an Nvidia card and are interested in a
	complete HOWTO for installing the Nvidia drivers and an
	assortment of OpenGL libraries (GLU, glut, Qt, OpenGL man pages),
	then see the NVIDIA-OpenGL-Configuration_miniHOWTO at:

		You might need to remove all the optimization
		compiler flags in order to get a stable binary.
		(I did)  You can play around with them.  For instance,
		strange things happened when it opened the pak files
		with optimizations on:  It would error out saying
		there are millions of files in id1/pak0.pak!
         </para>
         <para>
		I removed all of the following RELEASE_CFLAGS:
                <screen>

          <para>
		However, further experimentation seemed to show that
		at least the following two are ok:
                <screen>

		-ffast-math
		-fexpensive-optimizations
                </screen>
          </para>

	  <para>
		The really troublesome flag seems to be the -O6
		flag.  I tried setting it down to -O1 and still had
		trouble.  The -malign* flags were unnecessary too.

	Make sure that you have a symlink from /usr/X11 to

   	Fix the mouse hide problem.
    </para>

    <para>
	The quake code, as it is, does not hide the mouse when you use it.
	The pointer would remain visible and jitter around a fixed point in
	the middle of the screen - very annoying.  I found the following simple fix in
	a mail archive about glx development at:
	<ulink url="http://lists.openprojects.net/pipermail/glx-dev/1999-October/000994.html">http://lists.openprojects.net/pipermail/glx-dev/1999-October/000994.html</ulink>

        <screen>

	cd q1src/QW/client
	edit the file: gl_vidlinuxglx.c
        </screen>
     </para>

     <para>
	At the top of the function called install_grabs(void) (Line 234), add the
	following code:
        <screen>

	static void install_grabs(void)
	{
		/* vars to make blank cursor */
		Pixmap blank;
		XColor dummy;
		char data[1] = {0};
		Cursor cursor;
				
		/* make a blank cursor */
		blank = XCreateBitmapFromData (dpy, win, data, 1, 1);
		if(blank == None) fprintf(stderr, "error: out of memory.\n");
		cursor = XCreatePixmapCursor(dpy, blank, blank, &amp;dummy, &amp;dummy, 0, 0);
		XFreePixmap (dpy, blank);
		Con_Printf("Cursor blanked.\n");
        </screen>
     </para>

     <para>
	The 8th parameter to XGrabPointer should be changed from
	"None" to "cursor" to use the blank cursor:
        <screen>
	
	XGrabPointer(dpy, win,
			 True,
			 0,
			 GrabModeAsync, GrabModeAsync,
			 win,
			 cursor,
			 CurrentTime);
        </screen>
	(see: man XGrabPointer)
     </para>
				
     <para>
	This fix might work for the other client builds if you make
	similar changes in the appropriate *vid*.c file.  As it is,
	this creates a memory leak as it allocates another Cursor
	object everytime through and doesn't call XFreeCursor() but
	this is probably not a problem since I don't think a 1x1
	cursor is using much memory.  If you want, you can apply the
	following patch against <filename>q1src/QW/client/gl_vidlinuxglx.c</filename>
	(<command>patch gl_vidlinuxglx.c patchfile</command>).  Just cut and paste the
	contents between the begin/end patchfile lines into a file
	called patchfile (or whatever you want to call it).  Save
	patchfile in the <filename>q1src/QW/client</filename> directory where
	gl_vidlinuxglx.c is.  Then run the command:

        <screen>
	
	<command>patch gl_vidlinuxglx.c patchfile</command>
        </screen>
     </para>

     <para>
	This patch file will make gl_vidlinuxglx.c such that it doesn't have any
	memory leak.  You can download this patch file at:
        <ulink url="http://www.comptechnews.com/~reaster/gl_vidlinuxglx.c.patch">http://www.comptechnews.com/~reaster/gl_vidlinuxglx.c.patch</ulink>.

		All X applications accept a -display command
		line argument to tell it which X server to
		display on.  Every X program is an X server
		client.  0.0 represents the screen on F7, 1.0
		on F8, etc.  localhost is your computer.  Its
		possible and very common to execute an X
		program on one computer but have it display
		on some other workstation.  localhost could
		be an IP address or the dns name of any
		computer running X that is accepting
		connections from where you run the X client
		application program.

	Light effects.
	</para>

	<para>	
		At the console, you can try turning on and off the flashblend function
		and see which lighting effects you prefer:
	<screen>
			
		gl_flashblend 0
		gl_flashblend 1		
	</screen>
		
	</para>
		
	<para>
		When it is on (1), you may notice colored light effects around flags
		and special items.  In this mode, you may NOT see flashes from
		weapons and light on the walls from rockets.  The exact effects of
		toggling flashblend may depend on your specific OpenGL installation.
	</para>

	<para>		
		When it is off (0), there may not be any COLORED light, but otherwise
		all light effects work.  Flags and special items have a glow around
		them and light up surrounding surfaces.  Weapons flash when fired and
		rockets light up everything around them as they travel.
