      This mini-HOWTO is about how to install the
	  <ulink url="http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</ulink>
	  drivers for
      <ulink url="http://www.nvidia.com/">Nvidia</ulink> graphics cards on
	  <ulink url="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</ulink>.
	  In addition to just installing the Nvidia drivers, this mini-HOWTO
	  also explains how to install
	  <ulink url="http://www.XFree86.org/">XFree86</ulink>, the
      OpenGL Utility library
	  (part of <ulink url="http://www.mesa3d.org/">Mesa</ulink>),
	  the OpenGL Utility Toolkit
	  (<ulink url="http://reality.sgi.com/mjk/glut3/">glut</ulink>),
      the full set of OpenGL manpages,
	  <ulink url="http://www.trolltech.com/">Qt</ulink> and its OpenGL extension,
	  and <ulink url="http://www.blackdown.org/">Java</ulink> and
      its Java 3D extension so that a user can have a complete runtime and
      development environment for OpenGL applications on Linux.

	<title>Linux Kernel >= 2.2.12 Required</title>
	<para>
	First of all, the OpenGL drivers for the Nvidia cards currently require
	a system with Linux kernel 2.2.12 or later.  Release versions of
	kernel 2.4.x are supported. If you don't have it, then
	you will have to upgrade your system's Linux kernel; see
	<ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">
	The Linux Kernel HOWTO</ulink> for details.

	<para>
	XFree86 4.0 or later, preferably 4.0.2 as of this writing, is also required.
	Its installation will be covered later.

	<para>
	<ulink url="http://mesa3d.sourceforge.net/">http://mesa3d.sourceforge.net/</ulink>
	</para>

	<para>
        Mesa is the library that provides the foundation for the 3D support included in XFree86, which comes only
        with the libGL OpenGL core library component.  Mesa is a software renderer.  To enable hardware
        accelerated performance, many 3D hardware manufacturers provide a drop-in replacement
        for Mesa's standard software-only libGL rendering library.  For this document, we
        are only interested in NVIDIA's libGL drop-in replacement library.
        </para>

        <para>
        MesaLib provides a software OpenGL implementation consisting of libGL.  It also provides libGLU (GL Utility).
        libGLU is a library built on top of libGL to provide some higher-level functions for applications.
        OpenGL itself, libGL, is considered a low-level library. GLU is a standard part of most OpenGL
        installations and many programs make use of it.
        </para>

        <para>
        MesaDemos provides many OpenGL demo programs and, more importantly, the
		<ulink url="http://www.opengl.org/developers/documentation/glx.html">GL Utility Toolkit</ulink>
        (libglut) library. GLUT provides a window system independent interface between OpenGL
	and any supported window system.  For instance, on the X Window System, it
	hides the details of using glX functions to setup a window.  Programmers
	can write code once and can compile it to work on MS Windows or X, etc
	provided that a GLUT library is available on the target platform. Like libGLU, libglut
        is a standard part of most OpenGL installations and is required by many programs even though
        it is not packaged with XFree86.
        </para>

	<para>
        While GLUT is bundled with MesaDemos, it is also available as a separate package from
        its original project website:
        </para>

	<para>
	glut-3.7.tar.gz
	glut_data-3.7.tar.gz
	</para>

	<para>
        <ulink url="http://reality.sgi.com/mjk/glut3/">http://reality.sgi.com/mjk/glut3/</ulink>
	</para>

	<para>
        You may use <emphasis>either</emphasis> the GLUT included with MesaDemos (preferred and easier) or the GLUT from its
        project website.  Don't install both!  It's recommended at this time to go with the GLUT
        packaged with MesaDemos, but instructions on how to install the other GLUT are still provided
        in the next section as an option.  Note that MesaDemos does not include the glut manpages, so
        you may want to download the project GLUT package just to install its manpages.

	<para>
	Qt is a cross-platform GUI library that makes it easy to create X applications
	with standard GUI elements (widgets) like menubars, scollbars, dropdown lists,
	checkboxes, buttons, multiple document interface, and many other GUI things.
	Using Qt, a program can be compiled for both MS Windows and X without
	changing any code.  Its a very popular GUI library and is used to create
	the core libraries of KDE (<ulink url="http://www.kde.org/">http://www.kde.org/</ulink>).
	</para>

	<para>
	Qt has functions (previously as an extension in $QTDIR/extensions/opengl)
        for OpenGL that provides for
	creating OpenGL rendering contexts in Qt windows.  This provides some
	alternative to both GLUT and using the glX functions directly, plus the
	added benefit of full access to the excellent qt widgets and
	cross-platform portability.
	</para>

	<para>
	This is useful if you want to compile or develop programs based on Qt
        (e.g., KDE2 and its apps).

        Note that XFree86 4.0.1 and later is required with driver 0.9-6 and later.

	The NVIDIA drivers provide a kernel driver: /lib/modules/2.2.16/video/NVdriver
	and libGL.so and libGLcore.so files that go into /usr/lib/ to replace
	and Mesa ones that might be in there. libGL.so is OpenGL.  These files
	are Nvidia's own hardware accelerated OpenGL implementation.

	<title>Java 2 SDK, Java 3D extension, and Java PlugIn for Netscape (optional)</title>

        <para>
        The following files are available at <ulink url="http://www.blackdown.org/">http://www.blackdown.org/</ulink>:

        </itemizedlist>

        <para>
        Note that to install these Java files, your system needs to have glibc 2.1.3 or better.
        To check your version of glibc:
        <screen>

		ls -l /lib/libc*
        </screen>
		On rpm-based systems (like RedHat and Mandrake), you can try:
		<screen>

		rpm -q glibc
		</screen>
        </para>

	<para>
	Java2 1.3.0 FCS can also be used and it includes the JavaPlugin. If you use it, you
	don't have to get JavaPlugin-1.2.2-FCS.  Installation of this Plugin is different
	and you'll have to see its documentation.  Installation of Java2 1.3.0 itself, and Java3D, is
	the same as with Java2 1.2.2.

        <para>
        The
		<ulink url="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/index.html">Java 3D</ulink>
		media extension contains many 3D demo programs/applets and takes advantage of the
        OpenGL hardware acceleration on the system.  The Java 3D API uses the OpenGL API
		internally.  The demos run as normal Java applications and also as applets
        inside Netscape (4.7x) via the Java PlugIn, or inside

        <para>
        Installation of the software packages requires root login, which can be obtained
        easily via the superuser/setuser command: <command>su -</command>
		(see, <command>man su</command>).
        </para>

	<para>
	If you have a version of XFree86 installed already, you may want to move it
	or delete it.  However, installing over an existing X is generally OK and
	preserves any programs or libraries you might have installed into the X
	directories (not that you should really do that):
	<screen>

	cd /usr
	mv X11R6 X11R6-old
	cd /etc
	mv X11 X11-old

	-- you may have an X directory in /var also
	cd /var
	mv X11R6 X11R6-old
	</screen>

	<para>
	If these locations are not correct for your distribution of Linux, you will
	have to look around your filesystem a bit - try looking in

	A file has to be edited to allow these man pages to compile/install with
	the rest of the distribution:

	cd /usr/src/release/xc/doc/man/GL
	Edit the file: Imakefile
		SUBDIRS = glx gl glu

	unset $SGML_CATALOG_FILES

	make
	make install

	-- Note: doctools installs the perl program sgmlfmt to
	-- /usr/local/bin.  It looks for the perl executable
	-- at /usr/local/bin/perl.  If perl is installed
	-- on your system at /usr/bin/perl, then it will not

	--	#define HasSgmlFmt YES
	--	#define BuildAllDocs YES
	--	#define HasZlib YES
	-- See the README file in doctools and xc/config/cf.
	-- HasZlib YES instructs XFree86 not to build and install
	-- it's own old zlib.  If you do not have zlib installed
	-- (check /usr/lib/libz*), then omit the HasZlib line or
	-- go download it and install it first:

	-- A common zlib conflict occurs when a system already
	-- has zlib installed and XFree86 installs it's also.

	<title>Install Mesa</title>

	<para>
	Note: This gives you the <filename>libGLU*</filename> and <filename>libglut*</filename>
		files that are missing in <productname>XFree86</productname>.
        <productname>XFree86</productname> only comes with the OpenGL core library,
		<filename>libGL</filename> (based on Mesa).  This
        also installs Mesa's <filename>libGL</filename>, but we will delete that since it is to be replaced
        by the Nvidia libGL.
        </para>

    <para>
	It's best to uninstall any old Mesa version you may have installed before
	installing a new Mesa.  Uninstalling software can be a dangerous operation,
	so know what you are doing!
	</para>

	<para>
	To completely uninstall any Mesa libs that may have come with Slackware:
	<screen>

		removepkg mesa
	</screen>
	For <command>rpm</command>-based systems (like RedHat and Mandrake), try:
	<screen>
		-- see what will be removed first
		rpm -e --test Mesa | less
		-- if ok, proceed
		rpm -e Mesa
	</screen>
	For Debian, you can try:
	<screen>
		apt-get remove Mesa
	</screen>
	Procedures vary for other distributions.  If there is no clear way to
	uninstall an existing Mesa, then at least confirm where it is installed:
	normally either under <filename class="directory">/usr</filename>
	or <filename class="directory">/usr/local</filename>.  The example below assumes that
	<application>Mesa</application> is installed (or going to get installed) under
	<filename class="directory">/usr</filename>.  Installing
	over an old version is probably harmless.  Look for <filename>/usr/lib/libMesa*</filename>
	or <filename>/usr/local/lib/libMesa*</filename> and delete them unless you have programs that
        need them.

    <para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
    or other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
    author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
    being considered responsible for modifications made by
    others.</para>

    <para>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that
    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the
    same sense.  It complements the GNU General Public License, which
    is a copyleft license designed for free software.</para>

    <para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
    for free software, because free software needs free documentation:
    a free program should come with manuals providing the same
    freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not limited
    to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
    regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
    printed book.  We recommend this License principally for works
    whose purpose is instruction or reference.</para>

    <title>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>

    <para>This License applies to any manual or other work that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  The "Document",
    below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the
    public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</para>

    <para>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work
    containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
    verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.</para>

    <para>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</para>

    <para>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections
    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
    in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

    <para>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that
    are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

    <para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>

    <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
    or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</para>

    <para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
    "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
    the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
    text.</para>

    either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
    License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this
    License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
    that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
    License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
    control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</para>

    above, and you may publicly display copies.</para>

    <title>COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>

    <para>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</para>

    <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</para>

    <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</para>

    <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</para>

      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</para>

    <para>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</para>

    <para>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</para>

    <para>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for
    or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="5">
    <title>COMBINING DOCUMENTS</title>

    <para>You may combine the Document with other documents released
    under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
    combined work in its license notice.</para>

    <para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,
    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</para>

    <para>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
    "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
    entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
    "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
    must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="6">
    <title>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</title>

    <para>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
    other documents released under this License, and replace the
    individual copies of this License in the various documents with a
    single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
    follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of
    the documents in all other respects.</para>

    <para>You may extract a single document from such a collection,
    and distribute it individually under this License, provided you
    insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
    follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
    copying of that document.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="7">
    <title>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</title>

    <para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
    Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</para>

    <para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
    aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
    aggregate.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="8">
    <title>TRANSLATION</title>

    <para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
    4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
    include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition
    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
    include a translation of this License provided that you also
    include the original English version of this License.  In case of
    a disagreement between the translation and the original English
    version of this License, the original English version will
    prevail.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="9">
    <title>TERMINATION</title>

    <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
    Document except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any
    other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
    Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
    rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="10">
    <title>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</title>

    <para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
    versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
    version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
    concerns.  See <ulink
    url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</ulink>.</para>

    <para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
    version number.  If the Document specifies that a particular
    numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to
    it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that specified version or of any later version that has
    been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="">
    <title>How to use this License for your documents</title>

    <para>To use this License in a document you have written, include
    a copy of the License in the document and put the following
    copyright and license notices just after the title page:</para>

<blockquote><para>
      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".
</para></blockquote>

    <para>If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
    Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have
    no Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover
    Texts.</para>

    <para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
    code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
    choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public
    License, to permit their use in free software.</para>
