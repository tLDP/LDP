      the full set of OpenGL manpages,
	  <ulink url="http://www.trolltech.com/">Qt</ulink> and its OpenGL extension,
	  and <ulink url="http://www.blackdown.org/">Java</ulink> and
      its Java 3D extension so that a user can have a complete runtime and
      development environment for OpenGL applications on Linux.

 <title>Introduction</title>
 <para>
 The installation of the NVIDIA drivers under Linux can be quite easy
 in itself. However, there is a little more to it sometimes than
 just unpacking the driver files.
 </para>

 <para>
 Since certain versions of the NVIDIA drivers require upgrading your
 XFree86 to work, I've included some material on installing XFree86.
 If upgrading XFree86 is necessary for you, you can read this document
 but also carefully read the information at
 <ulink url="http://www.XFree86.org/">XFree86.org</ulink>.
 </para>

 <para>
 The NVIDIA driver is only concerned with installing the OpenGL libGL
 library. But since there is more to a complete OpenGL installation than
 just libGL, I cover the installation of defacto standard OpenGL add-on
 libraries like GL Utility (libGLU) and GL Utility Toolkit (libglut).
 </para>

 <para>
 Going a little beyond the basics, I cover the installation of some
 other libraries you might want to consider:
 <ulink url="http://www.trolltech.com/">TrollTech</ulink>'s Qt C++ Library
 and the Java language
 <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/">Java 3D API</ulink>.
 </para>

	<sect1>
	<title>Linux Kernel >= 2.2.12 Required</title>
	<para>
	First of all, the OpenGL drivers for the Nvidia cards currently require
	a system with Linux kernel 2.2.12 or later.  Recent releases of
	kernel 2.4.x are supported and are recommended since most new development
	happens in the 2.4 kernels. If you don't have it, then
	you will have to upgrade your system's Linux kernel; see
	<ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">
	The Linux Kernel HOWTO</ulink> for details.
	</para>

	<para>
	The Linux kernel can be downloaded at:
	<ulink url="http://www.kernel.org/">http://www.kernel.org/</ulink>
	</para>
	</sect1>

	<sect1>
	<title>XFree86 4.0 or later</title>
	<para>
	The current version of XFree86 is 4.2.0 as of this writing.
	It can be downloaded as source or binaries. It is generally recommended
	to download the binaries these days. See
	<ulink url="http://www.xfree86.org/">http://www.XFree86.org</ulink> for
	the lastest official information on installation of XFree86.
	Later in this document, I describe only the very basic procedure
	for compiling and installing from the source.
	</para>

	<para>
	XFree86 source code comes in three files:
	<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>X420src-1.tgz</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>X420src-2.tgz</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>X420src-3.tgz</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>doctools-1.3.tgz</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>utils.tgz</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	</para>

	<para>
	Doctools is the DocBook SGML package used by XFree86 to prepare the X documentation.
	Utils contains the source for the "extract" program, which is a modified GNU tar with
	gzip support. Extract is only important if you are installing a binary distribution
	of XFree86 on top of your existing XFree86 to upgrade it. Extract unlinks old existing
	files that are being extracted/updated instead of skipping them. Extract comes with the
	binary distributions so utils.tgz is only important for making your own binary
	distribution.
	</para>

	<para>
	You can download XFree86 from its ftp site:
	<ulink url="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/">ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/</ulink>
	</para>

	<para>
	XFree86 includes
	<ulink url="http://www.sgi.com/software/opensource/glx/">GLX</ulink>,
	the OpenGL X interface functions.
	Each window system has to provide the platform-specific interfaces
	between OpenGL and the window system for mapping a GL rendering
	context to a window system widget. Recent versions of XFree86, like
	version 4.2.0, now also include libGLU and the OpenGL manual pages.
	</para>
	</sect1>

	<sect1>
	<title>OpenGL man pages</title>

	<para>
	XFree86 prior to version 4.2.0 comes with only the GLX and (maybe) GLU man pages.
	If you wanted a full set of OpenGL man pages, you had to get them yourself.
	<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>mangl.tar.Z</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>manglu.tar.Z</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>manglx.tar.Z (you don't need this one)</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	</para>

	<para>
	If you are using XFree86 4.2.0 or later, you should already have the manglx OpenGL interface
	extension man pages, mangl OpenGL library man pages, and the manglu GL Utility library pages too.
	If you are using XFree86 prior to 4.2.0, you'll have to see what you have included
	with your XFree86 version and get some of the packages above. As time goes on, XFree86
	has been including more	of these manual pages and other standard OpenGL add-on libraries.
	</para>

	<para>
	These packages can be found at:
	<ulink url="ftp://ftp.sgi.com/sgi/opengl/doc/">ftp://ftp.sgi.com/sgi/opengl/doc/</ulink>
	</para>

	<para>
	These man page packages are in a format ready to be unpacked into the
	XFree86 source distributions (if needed/missing), see below.
	</para>
	</sect1>

	<title>Mesa 3D</title>

	<para>
	<ulink url="http://mesa3d.sourceforge.net/">http://mesa3d.sourceforge.net/</ulink>
	</para>

	<para>
        Mesa is the library that provides the foundation for the 3D support included in XFree86. Originally, Mesa
		included a software-only libGL that only claims to be "similar to that of OpenGL." Mesa now
		also supports hardware acceleration for a growing number of cards (see their site for details).
		The Mesa package also includes an implementation of the libGLU Utility library and the libglut
		GL Utility Toolkit library. Some versions of XFree86 only included the libGL from Mesa and
		some header files. With recent releases of XFree86, like 4.2.0, more has been added
		from Mesa, like libGLU and the manual pages. libglut may still be missing from your XFree86
		distribution, so you may still like to get it from the Mesa distribution or from the GLUT
		distribution directly.
	</para>
	<para>
	As shipped, XFree86 will support software OpenGL rendering (painfully slow) using the Mesa libGL.
	It may also support hardware accelerated OpenGL for some cards that have a fully open source
	driver. But for NVIDIA, the subject of this document, there is no fully open sourced
	hardware accelerated OpenGL driver included in XFree86. The NVIDIA GLX/OpenGL driver we download
	from <ulink url="http://www.nvidia.com/">NVIDIA.com</ulink> is a binary, closed source driver
	that is a drop-in hardware accelerated replacement for the Mesa libGL.so file.
        </para>

        <para>
        libGLU is a library built on top of libGL to provide some higher-level functions for applications.
        OpenGL itself, libGL, is considered a low-level library. GLU is a standard part of most OpenGL
        installations and many programs make use of it.
        </para>

        <para>
        MesaDemos provides many OpenGL demo programs and, more importantly, the
		<ulink url="http://www.opengl.org/developers/documentation/glut/index.html">GL Utility Toolkit</ulink>
        (libglut) library. GLUT provides a window system independent interface between OpenGL
		and any supported window system.  For instance, on the X Window System, it
		hides the details of using glX functions to setup a window.  Programmers
		can write code once and can compile it to work on MS Windows or X, etc
		provided that a GLUT library is available on the target platform. Like libGLU, libglut
        is a standard part of most OpenGL installations and is required by many programs.
        </para>

	<para>
        While GLUT is bundled with MesaDemos, it is also available as separate packages:
        </para>

	<para>
	glut-3.7.tar.gz
	glut_data-3.7.tar.gz
	</para>

	<para>
	from <ulink url="http://www.opengl.org/developers/documentation/glut/index.html">http://www.opengl.org/developers/documentation/glut/index.html</ulink>
	</para>

	<para>
        You may use <emphasis>either</emphasis> the GLUT included with MesaDemos (preferred and easier) or the GLUT from its
        project website.  Don't install both!  It's recommended at this time to go with the GLUT
        packaged with MesaDemos, but instructions on how to install the other GLUT are still provided
        in the next section as an option.  Note that MesaDemos does not include the glut manpages, so
        you may want to download the project GLUT package just to install its man pages.

	Qt is a cross-platform GUI library that makes it easy to create X applications
	with standard GUI elements (widgets) like menubars, scollbars, dropdown lists,
	checkboxes, buttons, multiple document interface, and many other GUI things.
	Using Qt, a program can be compiled for both MS Windows and X without
	changing any code.  Its a very popular GUI library and is used to create
	the core libraries of KDE (<ulink url="http://www.kde.org/">http://www.kde.org/</ulink>).
	</para>

	<para>
	Qt has functions (previously as an extension in $QTDIR/extensions/opengl)
        for OpenGL that provides for
	creating OpenGL rendering contexts in Qt windows.  This provides some
	alternative to both GLUT and using the glX functions directly, plus the
	added benefit of full access to the excellent Qt widgets and
	cross-platform portability.
	</para>

	<para>
	This is useful if you want to compile or develop programs based on Qt
        (e.g., KDE2 and its apps).

	The NVIDIA drivers provide a kernel driver: /lib/modules/kernel.version.number/video/NVdriver
	and libGL.so and libGLcore.so files that go into /usr/lib/ to replace
	and Mesa ones that might be in there. libGL.so is OpenGL.  These files
	are Nvidia's own hardware accelerated OpenGL implementation.

        <para>
        Installation of the software packages requires root login, which can be obtained
        easily via the superuser/setuser command: <command>su -</command>
		(see, <command>man su</command>).
        </para>

	<para>
	The following explains the installation of XFree86 from source in only the
	most basic terms. Make sure to read all the XFree86 documentation to
	learn about special options.
	</para>

	<para>
	If you have a version of XFree86 installed already, you may want to move it
	or delete it.  However, installing over an existing X is generally OK and
	preserves any programs or libraries you might have installed into the X
	directories (not that you should really do that):
	<screen>

	cd /usr
	mv X11R6 X11R6-old
	cd /etc
	mv X11 X11-old

	# you may have an X directory in /var also
	cd /var
	mv X11R6 X11R6-old
	</screen>
	</para>

	<para>
	If these locations are not correct for your distribution of Linux, you will
	have to look around your filesystem a bit - try looking in
	<filename class="directory">/var</filename>
	</para>

	<para>
	<screen>

	cd /usr/src
	mkdir release

	</screen>
	</para>

	<para>
	If you are using an old version of XFree86 for some reason, you may
	want to use the man page packages. XFree 4.2.0 and later has all these
	man pages already. Skip using the man page packages if you don't
	need them. Check in /usr/src/release/xc/doc/man to see what all
	is included with your XFree86.
	<screen>

	# unpack the man pages if they are missing.
	cd /usr/src
	tar -xvzf mangl.tar.Z
	tar -xvzf manglu.tar.Z
	</screen>

	<para>
	A file has to be edited to allow these man pages to compile/install with
	the rest of the distribution:
	<screen>

	cd /usr/src/release/xc/doc/man/GL
	# Edit the file: Imakefile
	#	SUBDIRS = glx gl glu

	# Having this variable set confuses the sgml docs build.
	# With it unset, the build uses the proper defaults.
	unset $SGML_CATALOG_FILES

	make
	make install

	# Note: doctools installs the perl program sgmlfmt to
	# /usr/local/bin.  It looks for the perl executable
	# at /usr/local/bin/perl.  If perl is installed
	# on your system at /usr/bin/perl, then it will not
	# find perl and the sgml docs build will fail!
	# Make a symlink if needed (or edit the script):
	cd /usr/local/bin
	ln -s /usr/bin/perl perl

	cd /usr/src/release
	cd xc/config/cf
	vi host.def
	# add the following three lines to host.def:
	#	#define HasSgmlFmt YES
	#	#define BuildAllDocs YES
	#	#define HasZlib YES
	# See the README file in doctools and xc/config/cf.
	# HasZlib YES instructs XFree86 not to build and install
	# it's own old zlib.  If you do not have zlib installed
	# (check /usr/lib/libz*), then omit the HasZlib line or

	# A common zlib conflict occurs when a system already
	# has zlib installed and XFree86 installs it's also.

        </screen>
	The <filename>index.html</filename> file in the docs might point to
	<filename>manindex5x.html</filename>, but the filename may
	actually be <filename>manindex5.html</filename>. Just make a symlink to fix it if needed:
        <screen>

		cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc/html
		ln -s manindex5.html manindex5x.html
        </screen>

	When <application>X</application> is up and running (later), try using the
	<command>xman</command> program to see that the gl,glx,glu

	<title>Install Mesa</title>

	<para>
	Note: This gives you the <filename>libGLU*</filename> and <filename>libglut*</filename>
		files that may be missing in <productname>XFree86</productname>.
        <productname>XFree86</productname> used to only come with the OpenGL core library,
		<filename>libGL</filename> (based on Mesa).  This
        also installs Mesa's <filename>libGL</filename>, but we will delete that since it is to be replaced
        by the Nvidia libGL.
        </para>

	<para>
	You should look in <filename>/usr/X11R6/lib</filename> to see if you already have
	libglut.* and libGLU.*. If you do, you can skip installing Mesa. Recent releases
	of XFree86 have been including more of Mesa as standard.
	</para>

    <para>
	It's best to uninstall any old Mesa version you may have installed before
	installing a new Mesa.  Uninstalling software can be a dangerous operation,
	so know what you are doing! If you have software depending on your old Mesa,
	you might need to keep it and just install the new Mesa along with it.
	</para>

	<para>
	To completely uninstall any Mesa libs that may have come with Slackware:
	<screen>

		removepkg mesa
	</screen>
	For <command>rpm</command>-based systems (like RedHat and Mandrake), try:
	<screen>
		# see what will be removed first
		rpm -e --test Mesa | less
		# if ok, proceed
		rpm -e Mesa
	</screen>
	For Debian, you can try:
	<screen>
		apt-get remove Mesa
	</screen>
	Procedures vary for other distributions.  If there is no clear way to
	uninstall an existing Mesa, then at least confirm where it is installed:
	normally either under <filename class="directory">/usr</filename>
	or <filename class="directory">/usr/local</filename>.  The example below assumes that
	<application>Mesa</application> is installed (or going to get installed) under
	<filename class="directory">/usr</filename>.  Installing
	over an old version is probably harmless.  Look for <filename>/usr/lib/libMesa*</filename>
	or <filename>/usr/local/lib/libMesa*</filename> and delete them unless you have programs that
        need them.

	<title>Install NVIDIA kernel driver package</title>
	<para>
	First, unpack the kernel driver source.
	<screen>

	cd /usr/src
	tar -xvzf NVIDIA_kernel-1.0-2314.tar.gz
	tar -xvzf NVIDIA_GLX-1.0-2313.tar.gz
	cd NVIDIA_kernel-1.0-2314
	</screen>
	Now, before building and installing this kernel driver, it has some
	AGP options	that can affect performance. You shouldn't really attempt to use these
	options during your first attempt at getting your card working and not unless
	you are using a very recent 2.4 kernel and the lastest nvidia drivers.
	</para>

	<para>
	The Linux kernel source can be compiled with an AGP character
	device that the Nvidia driver can use to get better performance. If your
	kernel does not have the AGP driver for your motherboard chipset compiled in,
	then the Nvidia kernel driver uses its own built-in AGP support if your
	video card is an AGP card. If you want to experiment with the Linux
	kernel AGP support, you should be able to rebuild and install your kernel
	with the appropriate support:
	<screen>
	cd /usr/src/linux
	make menuconfig
	# Go to Character devices and put a * by /dev/agpgart support
	# and also put a * by your motherboard chipset type.
	# Go to the Processor type and features and put a * by
	# MTTR support.
	# Save the config.
	make
	make modules
	make install
	make modules_install
	reboot
	</screen>
	</para>

	<para>
	Futher tweaking can be done to the file <filename>os-registry.c</filename>
	in the NVIDIA kernel source. Looking though this file, you will see many
	flag variables (they can be set to 0 or 1) to control options that affect
	performance and stability! You should try your configuration with this
	file unmodified first to see that your system works. If it does, you
	can try these options. Among the options you can try here are:
	</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Enabling AGP 4x on VIA chipsets (by default constrained to only 2x)</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Enabling Side Band Addressing (your card needs to support this)</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Enabling Fast Writes (IIRC, this must be enabled in your motherboard BIOS too)</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>


	<tip>
		<para>
		If you experience problems starting X, see the files
		<filename>TNT_USERS_README</filename> and
		<filename>M64_USERS_README</filename>.  These files
		explain how to tweak the kernel driver.  They were
		written to fix problems with <productname>TNT</productname>

	Installing the Nvidia OpenGL library package is nothing too special.
	First you need to clean up some old files.
	<screen>

	# delete the libGL.* files that come with XFree86 / Mesa ...

	cd /usr/X11R6/lib

	rm libglx*
	cd /usr/lib
	rm libGL.*
	</screen>
	</para>

	<para>
	With the conflicting old files gone, you can begin the installation.
	<screen>

	cd ..
	cd NVIDIA_GLX-1.0-2313
	make
	ldconfig

	# make might not install the C header files that come with
	# the libraries in the NVIDIA_GLX package so, do this:
	cd usr/include/GL
	cp *.h /usr/include/GL
	# usr/include/GL is a subdirectory in the NVIDIA_GLX package.
	# /usr/include/GL should be a symlink to /usr/X11R6/include/GL

	# Make a basic XF86Config file using the "nv" driver:
	cd /etc/X11
	xf86config
	# Follow the prompts and fill in the information xf86config asks for.
	# Select the Nvidia GeForce or appropriate name.
	# You can test X with this XF86Config file, or continue for OpenGL:

	# You must edit XF86Config and set the following:
	vi XF86Config
	#	Load "glx"
	#	Replace 'driver "nv"' with 'driver "nvidia"'
	#	Put "1600x1200" first (or your preferred screen resolution)
	#	Copy ttf fonts from Windows into a font directory and add a font path.
    #            Use ttmkfdir (check freshmeat.net) to a fonts.dir file.
	#	A good place to keep your own fonts is /usr/local/share/fonts ...

	# Nvidia drivers do NOT use the dri module - don't load it.

        # You may like to edit /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc to have run "startkde"
        # or "gnome-session" instead of twm.

	# Note: /usr/include/GL should be a symlink to /usr/X11R6/include/GL

	</para>

	<para>
	Specifying "nvidia" for the driver in the <filename>XF86Config</filename>
	makes that take effect each time you <command>startx</command>.
	But the <filename>NVdriver</filename> kernel driver will have to be
	loaded before you startx. It can be loaded with:
	<screen>
		# to load it
		insmod NVdriver
		# If you need to unload it:
		rmmod NVdriver
	</screen>
	You should not have to use <command>insmod</command> manually. The NVdriver installation
	should have inserted a line into <filename>/etc/modules.conf</filename>
	(or <filename>conf.modules</filename>) that looks something like:
        <screen>

                alias char-major-195 NVdriver
        </screen>
       If this line is present, <filename>NVdriver</filename> is loaded automatically
		when <command>X</command> is started.
        You can check if its loaded using the command, <command>lsmod</command>.
	</para>

	<para>
	In my experience, your video system will become unstable if you compile,
	load, and unload the NVdriver module. You should reboot your system
	after rebuilding this module to help make sure your system doesn't
	lock inside X. Its possible that your screen will go black and the keyboard
	will become unresponsive after switching NVdriver. It is advisable to
	always have another computer with telnet or ssh that you can use to
	get into your Linux box to shut it down properly if this happens.

    whose purpose is instruction or reference.</para>

    <title>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>

    <para>This License applies to any manual or other work that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  The "Document",
    below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the
    public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</para>

    <para>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work
    containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
    verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.</para>

    <para>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</para>

    <para>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections
    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
    in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

    <para>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that
    are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

    <para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>

    <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
    or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</para>

    <para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
    "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
    the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
    text.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdlcopying">
    <title>VERBATIM COPYING</title>

    <para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium,
    either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
    License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this
    License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
    that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
    License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
    control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</para>

    <para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
    above, and you may publicly display copies.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdlcopyingq">
    <title>COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>

    <para>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</para>

    <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</para>

    <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</para>

    <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</para>

    <title>MODIFICATIONS</title>

    <para>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the
    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
    that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
    License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the
    Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
    Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition,
    you must do these things in the Modified Version:</para>

    <orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">
      <listitem><para>Use in the Title Page

    </orderedlist>

    <para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</para>

    <para>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</para>

    <para>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</para>

    <para>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for
    or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</para>

    <title>COMBINING DOCUMENTS</title>

    <para>You may combine the Document with other documents released
    under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
    combined work in its license notice.</para>

    <para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,
    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</para>

    <para>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
    "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
    entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
    "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
    must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</para>

    single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
    follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of
    the documents in all other respects.</para>

    <para>You may extract a single document from such a collection,

    insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
    follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
    copying of that document.</para>

    <title>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</title>

    <para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
    Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</para>

    <para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the

    <title>TRANSLATION</title>

    <para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
    4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
    include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition
    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
    include a translation of this License provided that you also
    include the original English version of this License.  In case of

    <title>TERMINATION</title>

    <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
    Document except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any
    other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
    Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or

    <title>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</title>

    <para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
