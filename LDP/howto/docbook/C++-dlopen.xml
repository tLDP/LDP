    <title>The Problem</title>

    <para>At some time you might have to load a library (and use its
      functions) at runtime; this happens most often when you are
      writing some kind of plug-in or module architecture for your
      program.</para>

    <para>In the C language, loading a library is very simple (calling
      <function>dlopen</function>, <function>dlsym</function> and
      <function>dlclose</function> is enough), with C++ this is a bit
      more complicated. The difficulties of loading a C++ library
      dynamically are partially due to <link linkend="mangling">name
      mangling</link>, and partially due to the fact that the
      <function>dlopen</function> API was written with C in mind, thus
      not offering a suitable way to load classes.</para>

    <para>Before explaining how to load libraries in C++, let's better
      analyze the problem by looking at name mangling in more
      detail. I recommend you read the explanation of name mangling,
      even if you're not interested in it because it will help you
      understanding why problems occur and how to solve them.</para>

    <sect2 id="mangling">
      <title>Name Mangling</title>

      <para>In every C++ program (or library, or object file), all
        non-static functions are represented in the binary file as
        <emphasis>symbols</emphasis>. These symbols are special text
        strings that uniquely identify a function in the program,
        library, or object file.</para>

      <para>In C, the symbol name is the same as the function name:
        the symbol of <function>strcpy</function> will be
        <computeroutput>strcpy</computeroutput>, and so on. This is
        possible because in C no two non-static functions can have the
        same name.</para>

      <para>Because C++ allows overloading (different functions with
        the same name but different arguments) and has many features C
        does not &mdash; like classes, member functions, exception
        specifications &mdash; it is not possible to simply use the
        function name as the symbol name. To solve that, C++ uses
        so-called <emphasis>name mangling</emphasis>, which transforms
        the function name and all the necessary information (like the
        number and size of the arguments) into some weird-looking
        string which only the compiler knows about. The mangled name
        of <function>foo</function> might look like
        <computeroutput>foo@4%6^</computeroutput>, for example.</para>

      <para> One of the problems with name mangling is that the C++
        standard (currently <citation>ISO14882</citation>) does not
        define how names have to be mangled; thus every compiler
        mangles names in its own way. Some compilers even change their
        name mangling algorithm between different versions (notably
        g++ 2.x and 3.x). Even if you worked out how your particular
        compiler mangles names (and would thus be able to load
        functions via <function>dlsym</function>), this would most
        probably work with your compiler only, and might already be
        broken with the next version.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Classes</title>

      <para>Another problem with the <function>dlopen</function> API
        is the fact that it only supports loading
        <emphasis>functions</emphasis>. But in C++ a library often
        exposes a class which you would like to use in your
        program. Obviously, to use that class you need to create an
        instance of it, but that cannot be easily done.</para>

    <title>The Solution</title>

    <sect2 id="externC">
      <title><literal>extern "C"</literal></title>
      
      <para>C++ has a special keyword to declare a function with C
        bindings: <literal>extern "C"</literal>. A function declared
        as <literal>extern "C"</literal> uses the function name as
        symbol name, just as a C function. For that reason, only
        non-member functions can be declared as <literal>extern
        "C"</literal>, and they cannot be overloaded.</para>
      
      <para>Although there are severe limitations, <literal>extern
        "C"</literal> functions are very useful because they can be
        dynamically loaded using <function>dlopen</function> just like
        a C function.</para>

      <para>This does <emphasis>not</emphasis> mean that functions
        qualified as <literal>extern "C"</literal> cannot contain C++
        code. Such a function is a full-featured C++ function which
        can use C++ features and take any type of argument.</para>

    <sect2 id="loadingfunctions">
      <title>Loading Functions</title>

      <para>In C++ functions are loaded just like in C, with
        <function>dlsym</function>. The functions you want to load
        must be qualified as <literal>extern "C"</literal> to avoid
        the symbol name being mangled.</para>

      </example>

      <para>The function <function>hello</function> is defined in
        <filename>hello.cpp</filename>as <literal>extern
          "C"</literal>; it is loaded in <filename>main.cpp</filename>
        with the <function>dlsym</function> call. The function must be
        qualified as <literal>extern "C"</literal> because otherwise
        we wouldn't know its symbol name.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>There are two different forms of the
          <literal>extern "C"</literal> declaration: <literal>extern
            "C"</literal> as used above, and <literal>extern "C" {
            &hellip; }</literal> with the declarations between the
          braces. The first (inline) form is a declaration with extern
          linkage and with C language linkage; the second only affects
          language linkage. The following two declarations are thus
          equivalent:
          
          <informalexample>
            <programlisting>extern "C" int foo;
extern "C" void bar();
            </programlisting>
            and
          <programlisting>extern "C" {
     extern int foo;
     extern void bar();
 }</programlisting>
          </informalexample>

          As there is no difference between an
          <literal>extern</literal> and a
          non-<literal>extern</literal> <emphasis>function</emphasis>
          declaration, this is no problem as long as you are not
          declaring any variables. If you declare
          <emphasis>variables</emphasis>, keep in mind that

          <informalexample>
            <programlisting>extern "C" int foo;</programlisting>
            and
          <programlisting>extern "C" {
    int foo;
}</programlisting>
        </informalexample>
          
          are <emphasis>not</emphasis> the same thing.</para>
        
        <para>For further clarifications, refer to
          <citation>ISO14882</citation>, 7.5, with special attention
          to paragraph 7, or to <citation>STR2000</citation>,
          paragraph 9.2.4.</para>

        <para>Before doing fancy things with extern variables, peruse
          the documents listed in the <link linkend="seealso">see
          also</link> section.</para>

      </warning>

    </sect2>
    
    <sect2 id="loadingclasses">
      <title>Loading Classes</title>

      <para>Loading classes is a bit more difficult because we need
        an <emphasis>instance</emphasis> of a class, not just a
        pointer to a function.</para>

      <para>We cannot create the instance of the class using
        <literal>new</literal> because the class is not defined in the
        executable, and because (under some circumstances) we don't
        even know its name.</para>

      <para>The solution is achieved through polymorphism. We define a
        base, <emphasis>interface</emphasis> class with virtual
        members <emphasis>in the executable</emphasis>, and a derived,
        <emphasis>implementation</emphasis> class <emphasis>in the
          module</emphasis>. Generally the interface class is
        abstract (a class is abstract if it has pure virtual
        functions).</para>

      <para>As dynamic loading of classes is generally used for
        plug-ins &mdash; which must expose a clearly defined interface
        &mdash; we would have had to define an interface and derived
        implementation classes anyway.</para>

      <para>Next, while still in the module,  we define two additional helper
        functions, known as <emphasis>class factory
          functions</emphasis>. One of these functions creates an instance of the
        class and returns a pointer to it. The other function takes a
        pointer to a class created by the factory and destroys
        it. These two functions are qualified as <literal>extern
          "C"</literal>.</para>

      <para>To use the class from the module, load the two factory
        functions using <function>dlsym</function> just <link linkend="loadingfunctions">as we loaded the the hello
          function</link>; then, we can create and destroy as many
        instances as we wish.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Loading a Class</title>

            <literal>delete</literal> may be overloaded; this would
            cause a non-matching <literal>new</literal> and
            <literal>delete</literal> to be called, which could cause
            anything from nothing to memory leaks and segmentation
            faults. The same is true if different standard libraries
            were used to link the module and the executable.</para>
