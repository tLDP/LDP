  <section id="intro-what">
   <title>What is a console?</title>

   <para>The console is the text output device for system
   administration messages.  These messages come from the kernel, from
   the <application>init</application> system and from the system
   logger.</para>

   <para>On modern small computers the console is usually the
   computer's attached monitor and keyboard.</para>

   <para>On many older computers the console is an
   <acronym>RS-232</acronym> link to a terminal such as a
   <acronym>DEC</acronym>
   <productname><acronym>VT100</acronym></productname>.  This terminal
   is in a locked room and is continually observed by the
   minicomputer's operators.  Large systems from Sun, Hewlett-Packard
   and <acronym>IBM</acronym> still use serial consoles.</para>

   <para>It is usually possible to login from the console.  A login
   session from the console is treated by many parts of the operating
   system as being more trustworthy than a login session from other
   sources.  Logging in as the <systemitem
   class="username">root</systemitem> super-user from the console is
   the Command Line of Last Resort when faced with a misbehaving
   system.</para>

  </section> <!-- intro-what -->


  <section id="intro-why">
   <title>Why use a serial console?</title>

   <para>For the average user a serial console has no advantage over a
   console offered by a directly attached keyboard and screen.  Serial
   consoles are much slower, taking up to a second to fill a 80 column
   by 24 line screen.  Serial consoles generally only support
   non-proportional <acronym>ASCII</acronym> text, with limited
   support for languages other than English.  A new terminal can be
   more expensive than an old <acronym>PC</acronym>.</para>

   <para>There are some scenarios where serial consoles are
   useful. These are:</para>

   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>Systems administration of remote computers</term>
     <listitem>
      <para><systemitem class="osname">Linux</systemitem> is a good
      operating system for deployment at unstaffed sites.  <systemitem
      class="osname">Linux</systemitem> is also good for hosting
      critical network infrastructure such as <acronym>DNS</acronym>
      and <acronym>DHCP</acronym> services.  These services are
      generally installed at every site of an organisation including
      sites which may be too small or too remote to have information
      technology staff.</para>

      <para>System administration of these remote computers is usually
      done using <application><acronym>SSH</acronym></application>, but
      there are times when access to the console is the only way to
      diagnose and correct software failures.  Major upgrades to the
      installed distribution may also require console access.</para>

      <para>In these cases the serial console is attached to a modem.
      Access to the console is gained from a remote computer by
      dialing into the modem.  This allows the console to be reached
      from any telephone socket.</para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>High density racks of computers</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>Clusters of personal computers can outperform mainframe
      computers and form competitive supercomputers for some
      applications.  See the <ulink
      url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Cluster-HOWTO.html"><citetitle>Cluster-HOWTO</citetitle></ulink>
      for more information on clustering.</para>

      <para>These clusters are typically assembled into 19 inch
      telecommunications equipment racks and the system unit of each
      computer is typically one rack unit (or 1.75 inches) tall.  It
      is not desirable to put a keyboard and monitor on each computer,
      as a small cathode ray tube monitor would consume the space used
      by sixteen rack units.</para>

      <para>A first glance it seems that a monitor and keyboard switch
      is the best solution.  However the <acronym>VGA</acronym> signal
      to the monitor is small, so even with the switch the monitor
      cannot be placed very far away from the rack of
      computers.</para>

      <para>It is desirable to allow the consoles to be monitored in
      the operators' room of the computer center, rather than in the
      very expensive space of the machine room.  Although monitor
      switches with remote control and fiber optical extensions are
      available, this solution can be expensive.</para>

      <para>A standard <acronym>RS-232</acronym> cable can be 15
      meters in length.  Longer distances are easily possible. The
      cabling is cheap.  Terminal servers can be used to allow one
      terminal to access up to 90 serial consoles.</para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>Recording console messages</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>This is useful in two very different cases.</para>

      <para>Kernel programmers are often faced with a kernel error
      message that is displayed a split second before the computer
      reboots.  A serial console can be used to record that
      message. Another <systemitem class="osname">Linux</systemitem>
      machine can be used as the serial terminal.</para>

      <para>Some secure installations require all security events to
      be unalterably logged.  One way to meet this requirement is to
      print all console messages.  Connecting the serial console to a
      serial printer can achieve this.<footnote>

        <para>The <systemitem class="osname">Linux</systemitem>
        <productnumber>2.4</productnumber> kernel also supports the
        output of console messages to
        <productname>Centronics</productname> or
        <citetitle><acronym>IEEE</acronym> 1284-2000</citetitle>
        parallel printer interfaces.</para></footnote></para>

     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>Embedded software development</term>
     <listitem>
      <para><systemitem class="osname">Linux</systemitem> is
      increasingly being used as an operating system for embedded
      applications.  These computers do not have keyboards or
      screens.</para>

      <para>A serial port is a cheap way to allow software developers
      to directly access the embedded computer.  This is invaluable
      for debugging.  Most chip sets designed for embedded computers
      have a serial port precisely for this purpose.</para>

      <para>The shipping product need not present the
      <acronym>RS-232</acronym> port on an external connector.
      Alternatively the <acronym>RS-232</acronym> port is often used for
      downloading software updates.</para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>Craft terminal for telecommunications equipment</term>
     <listitem>
      <para><systemitem class="osname">Linux</systemitem> is
      increasingly being used as the operating system inside
      telecommunications equipment.  The <ulink
      url="http://www.osdlab.org/projects/cgl/">Carrier Grade
      Linux</ulink> consortia hopes to accelerate and coordinate this
      trend.</para>

      <para>Most telecommunications equipment is remotely managed from
      a distant computer.  However, site technicans (called
      <wordasword>craft personnel</wordasword> in telco-speak) need to
      access the equipment to test installation changes, check the
      status of reported faults, and so on.  The terminal used by the
      craft personnel is called the <wordasword>craft
      terminal</wordasword>.  The craft terminal plugs into the
      <wordasword>craft interface</wordasword> on the equipment.  The
      serial console makes an ideal craft interface.</para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
   </variablelist>

   <para>Unlike minicomputer systems, the
   <productname><acronym>IBM</acronym>
   <acronym>PC</acronym></productname> was not designed to use a
   serial console.  This has two consequences.</para>

   <para>Firstly, Power On Self-Test messages and Basic Input/Output
   System (<acronym>BIOS</acronym>) messages are sent to the screen
   and received from the keyboard.  This makes it difficult to use the
   serial port to reconfigure the <acronym>BIOS</acronym> and
   impossible to see Power On Self-Test errors.</para>

   <para>An increasing number of manufacturers of rackable
   <emphasis>server</emphasis> equipment are altering their
   <acronym>BIOS</acronym>s to optionally use the
   <acronym>RS-232</acronym> port for BIOS configuration and test
   messages.  If you are buying a machine specifically for use with
   serial console you should seek this feature.  If you have an
   existing machine that definitely requires access to the
   <acronym>BIOS</acronym> from the serial port then there are
   hardware solutions such as <ulink
   url="http://www.realweasel.com/"><productname>PC Weasel
   2000</productname></ulink>.</para>

   <para>Secondly, the <acronym>RS-232</acronym> port on the
   <productname><acronym>IBM</acronym>
   <acronym>PC</acronym></productname> is designed for connecting to a
   modem.  Thus a null modem cable is needed when connecting the PC's
   serial port to a terminal.</para>

  <section id="intro-word">
   <title>Alternative meanings of <quote>console</quote></title>

   <para>Some authors use the word <quote>console</quote> to refer to
   the keyboard and monitor that are attached to the system unit.
   This is described as a <quote>physical console</quote> by some
   <systemitem class="osname">Linux</systemitem> documentation.  The
   console where system messages appear is described as the
   <quote>logical console</quote> by that documentation.</para>

   <para>As an illustration of the difference, <productname>X
   Windows</productname> should start on the physical console but
   system messages issued by failures when starting <productname>X
   Windows</productname> should be written to the logical
   console.</para>

   <para>To avoid confusion this <citetitle>HOWTO</citetitle> uses the
   word <quote>console</quote> to describe the place where system
   messages are printed.  This <citetitle>HOWTO</citetitle> uses the
   phrase <quote>attached monitor and keyboard</quote> rather than the
   confusing words <quote>physical console</quote>.</para>

   <para>These distinctions are also made in the naming of devices.
   The device <filename class="devicefile">/dev/console</filename> is
   used to send messages to the console.  The symbolic link <filename
   class="symlink">/dev/systty</filename> points to the device which
   is used by the attached monitor and keyboard, often <filename
   class="devicefile">/dev/tty0</filename>.</para>

   <title>Configuration overview</title>

   <para>There are five major steps to configuring a serial
   console.</para>

   <procedure>
    <step>
     <para>Optionally, the <acronym>BIOS</acronym> may be configured
     to use the serial port.</para>
    </step>

    <step>
     <para>If needed, the boot loader may be configured to use the
     serial port.</para>
    </step>

    <step>
     <para>The Linux kernel must be configured to use the serial port
     as its console.  This is done by passing the kernel the
     <literal>console</literal> parameter when the kernel is started
     by the boot loader.</para>
    </step>

    <step>
     <para>The <application>init</application> system should keep a
     process running to monitor the serial console for logins.  The
     monitoring process is traditionally called
     <application>getty</application>.</para>
    </step>

    <step>
     <para>A number of system utilities need to be configured to make
     them aware of the console, or configured to prevent them from
     disrupting the console.</para>
    </step>
   </procedure>

   <para>Examples in this <citetitle>HOWTO</citetitle> are from
   <productname>Red Hat Linux</productname> versions
   <productnumber>7.1</productnumber> through to
   <productnumber>7.3</productnumber> (released 2001 through to 2002).
   The maintainer would appreciate updates when new versions of
   <productname>Red Hat Linux</productname> appear.  The maintainer
   would very much appreciate examples for <systemitem
   class="osname">Linux</systemitem> distributions that are dissimilar

 <chapter id="preparation">
  <title>Preparation</title>

  <para>This chapter ensures that access the existing console can be
  restored should the serial console fail to start.</para>

  <para>This chapter then discusses the selection of the
  <acronym>RS-232</acronym> port and its parameters.</para>


  <section id="preparation-fallback">
   <title>Create fallback position</title>

   <para>Good system administrators always have a viable fallback
   plan to cope with failures.  A mistake configuring the serial
   console can make both the serial console and the attached monitor
   and keyboard unusable.  A fallback plan is needed to retrieve
   console access.</para>

   <para>Many <systemitem class="osname">Linux</systemitem>
   distributions allow boot diskettes to be created.  Writing a boot
   diskette before altering the console configuration results in a
   boot diskette that passes good parameters to the kernel rather than
   parameters that may contain an error.</para>

   <para>Under <productname>Red Hat Linux</productname> a boot
   diskette is created by determining the running kernel
   version</para>

  <section id="preparation-setport">
   <title>Select a serial port </title>


   <section id="preparation-setport-name">
    <title>Serial port names</title>

    <para>Linux names its serial ports in the
    <productname>UNIX</productname> tradition.  The first serial port
    has the file name <filename
    class="devicefile">/dev/ttyS0</filename>, the second serial port
    has the file name <filename
    class="devicefile">/dev/ttyS1</filename>, and so on.</para>

    <para>This differs from the <productname><acronym>IBM</acronym>
    <acronym>PC</acronym></productname> tradition.  The first serial
    port is named <filename class="devicefile">COM1:</filename>, the
    second serial port is named <filename
    class="devicefile">COM2:</filename>, and so on.  Up to four serial
    ports can be present on a <productname><acronym>IBM</acronym>
    <acronym>PC/AT</acronym></productname> computer and its
    successors.</para>

    <para>Most boot loaders have yet another naming scheme.  The first
    serial port is numbered <literal>0</literal>, the second serial
    port is numbered <literal>1</literal>, and so on.</para>

    <para>If your distribution of <systemitem
    class="osname">Linux</systemitem> uses the
    <application>devfs</application> device manager then the serial
    ports have yet another name.  The first serial port is <filename
    class="devicefile">/dev/tts/0</filename>, the second serial port
    is <filename class="devicefile">/dev/tts/1</filename>, and so
    on.</para>

    <para>The result is that the first serial port is labeled
    <filename class="devicefile">COM1:</filename> on the chassis of
    the <productname><acronym>IBM</acronym>
    <acronym>PC</acronym></productname>; is known as <filename
    class="devicefile">/dev/ttyS0</filename> to <systemitem
    class="osname">Linux</systemitem>; is known as <filename
    class="devicefile">/dev/tts/0</filename> to <systemitem
    class="osname">Linux</systemitem> when configured with
    <application>devfs</application>; and is known as port
    <literal>0</literal> to many boot loaders.</para>

    <para>The examples in this <citetitle>HOWTO</citetitle> use this
    first serial port, as that is the serial port which most readers

      <para>The <systemitem class="osname">Linux</systemitem> kernel
      on a modern <acronym>PC</acronym> supports a serial console
      speeds of 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600 and 115200
      bits per second.</para>

      <para>The kernel supports a much wider range of serial bit rates
      when the serial interface is not being used as a serial
      console.<footnote><para>There is no good reason for this
      difference.  Feel free to submit a patch to the linux-kernel
      mailing list to correct this oddity.</para></footnote></para>

      <para>Very recent <systemitem class="osname">Linux</systemitem>
      kernels can also offer a serial console using a
      <acronym>USB</acronym> serial dongle at speeds of 1200, 2400,
      4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600 and 115200 bits per
      second.</para>

      <para>Most boot loaders only support a different range of speeds
      than are supported by the kernel.
      <productname>LILO</productname>
      <productnumber>21.7.5</productnumber> supports 110, 150, 300,
      600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 56000, 57600 and
      115200 bits per second.  <productname>SYSLINUX</productname>
      <productnumber>1.67</productnumber> supports 75 to 56000 bits
      per second.  <productname>GRUB</productname>
      <productnumber>0.90</productnumber> supports 2400, 4800, 9600,
      19200, 38400, 57600 and 115200 bits per second.</para>

      <para>You must chose the same speed for both the boot loader and
      for the <systemitem class="osname">Linux</systemitem> kernel.
      An operating system may use more than one boot loader.  For
      example, <productname>Red Hat Linux</productname> uses
      <productname>SYSLINUX</productname> to install or upgrade the
      operating system; <productname>LILO</productname> as the boot
      loader for <productname>Red Hat Linux</productname>
      <productnumber>7.1</productnumber> and earlier; and
      <productname>GRUB</productname> as the boot loader for
      <productname>Red Hat Linux</productname>
      <productnumber>7.2</productnumber> and later.</para>

      <para>If you are using a serial terminal or if you are using a
      dumb modem then the bit rate of the terminal or dumb modem must
      also match the bit rate selected in the boot loader and
      kernel.</para>

      <para>If the serial console is connected to a Hayes-style modem
      slower than 9600<abbrev>bps</abbrev> then configure the serial
      console with the same speed as the modem.  Modems faster than
      9600<abbrev>bps</abbrev> will generally automatically
      synchronize to the speed of the serial port.</para>

      <para>The selected bit rate must also be supported by the serial
      port's <acronym>UART</acronym> semiconductor chip.  Early
      <acronym>UART</acronym>s without on-chip receive buffers could
      only reliably receive at up to 14400<abbrev>bps</abbrev>, this
      includes models 8250A, 82510, 16450 and 16550 (with no
      <wordasword>A</wordasword>).  Recent <acronym>UART</acronym>s with
      receive buffers will work at all serial console bit rates, this
      includes models 16550A, 16552, 16650, 16654, 16750, 16850 and
      16950.</para>

      <para>Unless you have good reason, use the popular bit rate of
      9600 bits per second.  This is the default bit rate of a great
      many devices.</para>

      <para>The speeds that are supported by the kernel, the three
      common boot loaders, and all <productname><acronym>IBM</acronym>
      <acronym>PC</acronym>s</productname> capable of running
      <systemitem class="osname">Linux</systemitem> are: 2400, 4800,
      9600 and 19200 bits per second.  This is a depressingly small
      selection: not slow enough to support a call over an
      international phone circuit and not fast enough to upload large
      files.  You may need to choose a speed that will result in a
      less robust software configuration.</para>

      control.</para>

      <para>No flow control is the default, this is indicated by
      omitting &lt;flow_control&gt;.</para>

      <para><acronym>CTS</acronym>/<acronym>RTS</acronym> flow control
      is recommended, especially if login access is also provided to
      the serial port.  This is indicated by a &lt;flow_control&gt; of
      <literal>r</literal>.</para>

      <para><acronym>CTS</acronym>/<acronym>RTS</acronym> flow control
      regulates the flow of chatacters.  The computer does not send
      characters until Clear To Send is asserted by the modem.  If the
      computer is has enough buffering to recieve characters from the
      modem the computer asserts Ready to Send.  Thus neither the
      computer nor the modem's buffers are filled to
      overflowing.</para>

      <caution>
       <para>The kernel's
       <acronym>CTS</acronym>/<acronym>RTS</acronym> flow control is
       currently buggy.  Machines can take a significant time to write
       console messages if flow control is enabled but
       <acronym>CTS</acronym> will never be asserted (as occurs when
       there is no call present on a modem or no session on a null
       modem cable or cable to a terminal server).  As a result of the
       large number of kernel messages when the kernel is started a
       machine configured with the kernel's
       <acronym>CTS</acronym>/<acronym>RTS</acronym> flow control can
       take many minutes to reboot.</para>

       <para>The kernel's
       <acronym>CTS</acronym>/<acronym>RTS</acronym> flow control
       cannot be recommended at this time.  The
       <citetitle>HOWTO</citetitle>'s author has a kernel patch
       available which he is seeking to have included in the
       mainstream kernel source code.</para>

       <para>The <acronym>CTS</acronym>/<acronym>RTS</acronym> flow
       control in user-space applications does not share the kernel's
       bugs and <acronym>CTS</acronym>/<acronym>RTS</acronym> flow
       control is still recommended for

   <para>At present the <acronym>RS-232</acronym> status lines are
   ignored by the kernel.  A kernel message will be printed even if
   Data Carrier Detect and Data Set Ready are not asserted.  This
   leads to the kernel messages being sent to a modem which is idle
   and in command mode.</para>

   <para>The console's slack interpretation of <acronym>CTS</acronym>,
   <acronym>DSR</acronym> and <acronym>DCD</acronym> makes it
   impossible to connect a serial console to an
   <acronym>RS-232</acronym> multi-drop circuit.  Multi-drop circuits
   have more than two computers on the circuit; they are traditionally
   four-wire, satelite or wireless services.</para>

  <title>Configure the boot loader</title>

  <para>When a PC boots the CPU it runs code from Read-Only Memory.
  This code is the Basic Input/Output System, or
  <acronym>BIOS</acronym>.  The <acronym>BIOS</acronym> then loads a
  boot loader from the Master Boot Record of the first hard
  disk.<footnote>

    <para>As usual with <productname><acronym>IBM
    PC/AT</acronym></productname> hardware <quote>loads a boot loader
    from the <acronym>MBR</acronym> of the first hard disk</quote> is a
    simplification.  <acronym>BIOS</acronym> settings permitting, the
    <acronym>MBR</acronym> can be loaded from the first two detected
    hard disks of any controller card containing a
    <acronym>BIOS</acronym> extension.  Thus the
    <acronym>MBR</acronym> can be loaded from one of the first two
    detected <acronym>IDE</acronym> disks and one of the first two
    detected <acronym>SCSI</acronym> disks.</para></footnote>

  In turn, the boot loader reads the operating system into memory and
  then runs it.<footnote>

    <para>Another simplification.  A 512 byte <acronym>MBR</acronym>
    is too small to contain a program big enough to load a complex
    operating system.  Thus most boot loaders have two stages, the
    first stage is located in the <acronym>MBR</acronym> and is only
    able to load the second stage of the boot loader from somewhere on
    a disk (such as the boot sector of the first partition).  The
    second stage of the boot loader presents the user interface and
    loads the operating system.</para></footnote></para>

  <para>Neither the <acronym>BIOS</acronym> nor the boot loader are
  strictly necessary.  For example, there are <ulink
  url="http://www.acl.lanl.gov/linuxbios/">versions of Linux</ulink>
  that run directly from the flash memory which usually contains the
  <acronym>BIOS</acronym>.  Linux was originally designed to run
  without an interactive boot loader, by placing the kernel at
  particular sectors of the disk.</para>

  <para>The benefits of using a boot loader are:</para>

    <para>Parameters can be passed to the kernel interactively.  This

 <chapter id="configure-kernel">
  <title>Configure <systemitem class="osname">Linux</systemitem>
  kernel</title>

  <para>The <systemitem class="osname">Linux</systemitem> kernel is
  configured to select the console by passing it the
  <literal>console</literal> parameter.  The
  <literal>console</literal> parameter can be given repeatedly, but
  the parameter can only be given once for each console technology.
  So <literal>console=tty0 console=lp0 console=ttyS0</literal> is
  acceptable but <literal>console=ttyS0 console=ttyS1</literal> will
  not work.</para>

  <para>When multiple consoles are listed output is sent to all
  consoles and input is taken from the last listed console.  The last
  <literal>console</literal> is the one Linux uses as the <filename
  class="devicefile">/dev/console</filename> device.</para>

  <para>The syntax of the <literal>console</literal> parameter is
  given in <xref linkend="configure-kernel-syntax">.</para>

  <para><replaceable>&lt;serial_port&gt;</replaceable> is the number
  of the serial port.  This is defined in <xref
  linkend="configure-boot-loader-lilo-ebnf"> and discussed in <xref
  linkend="preparation-setport">.  The examples in this
  <citetitle>HOWTO</citetitle> use the first serial port, giving
  <replaceable>&lt;serial_port&gt;</replaceable> the value
  <literal>0</literal>, which in turn gives kernel parameter
  <literal>console=ttyS0</literal>.</para>

  <para>If you are using the <application>devfs</application> device
  filesystem with your Linux installation the kernel parameter for the
  first serial port is still <literal>ttyS0</literal>, even though the
  first serial device is no longer known as <filename
  class="devicefile">/dev/ttyS0</filename> but as <filename
  class="devicefile">/dev/ttys/0</filename>.</para>

  <para><replaceable>&lt;mode&gt;</replaceable> is defined in <xref
  linkend="preparation-setspeed-modesyntax"> and is discussed in <xref
  linkend="preparation-setspeed">.  The examples in this
  <citetitle>HOWTO</citetitle> use 9600 bits per second, one start
  bit, eight data bits, no parity, one stop bit, and no
  <acronym>CTS</acronym>/<acronym>RTS</acronym> flow control giving
  <replaceable>&lt;mode&gt;</replaceable> the value of
  <literal>9600n8</literal>.  When the current kernel flow control
  bugs are corrected this <citetitle>HOWTO</citetitle> will once again
  recommend the value <literal>9600n8r</literal>.</para>

  <para><replaceable>&lt;usb_port&gt;</replaceable> can specify the
  address of a <acronym>USB</acronym> dongle containing a serial port
  to be used as a serial console.<footnote>

    <para>A serial console attached to a <acronym>USB</acronym> dongle
    is only available in Linux kernel version 2.5.7 and later.  The
    2.5 series of kernels are developer's kernels and are not ready
    for production use.</para></footnote>

  For example, the serial port <literal>console=ttyS0,9600n8</literal>
  when moved to a <acronym>USB</acronym> serial dongle would be
  written as <literal>console=ttyUSB0,9600n8</literal>. The
  <acronym>USB</acronym> subsystem is started rather late in the boot
  process, console messages printed during boot before the
  <acronym>USB</acronym> subsystem is loaded will be lost.</para>

  <para>With no <literal>console</literal> parameter the kernel will
  use the first virtual terminal, which is <filename
  class="devicefile">/dev/tty0</filename>.  A user at the keyboard
  uses this virtual terminal by pressing
  <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo>.</para>

  <para>If your computer contains a video card then we suggest that
  you also configure it as a console.  This is done with the kernel
  parameter <literal>console=tty0</literal>.</para>

  <para>For computers with both a video card and a serial console in
  the port marked <quote><acronym>COM1:</acronym></quote> this
  <citetitle>HOWTO</citetitle> suggests the kernel parameters:</para>

<programlisting format="linespecific">

</programlisting>
  </figure>  <!-- configure-kernel-parameters-video -->

  <para>Kernel messages will appear on both the first virtual terminal
  and the serial port.  Messages from the
  <application>init</application> system and the system logger will
  appear only on the first serial port.  This can be slightly
  confusing when looking at the attached monitor: the machine will
  appear to boot and then hang.  Don't panic, the
  <application>init</application> system has started but is now
  printing messages to the serial port but is printing nothing to the
  screen.  If a <application>getty</application> has been configured
  then a <computeroutput>login:</computeroutput> prompt will
  eventually appear on the attached monitor.</para>

  <para>For <acronym>PC</acronym>s without a video card, this
  <citetitle>HOWTO</citetitle> suggests the kernel parameters:</para>

  <para>These parameters are passed to the booting kernel by the boot

  the <literal>console</literal> parameters to the kernel.</para>

  <title>Configure <productname>getty</productname></title>

  <para><application>getty</application> monitors serial lines,
  waiting for a connection.  It then configures the serial link, sends
  the contents of <filename>/etc/issue</filename>, and asks the person
  connecting for their login name.  <application>getty</application>
  then starts <application>login</application> and
  <application>login</application> asks the person for their password.
  If the user does nothing, <application>getty</application> or
  <application>login</application> hang up and
  <application>getty</application> goes back to waiting.</para>

  <para>The <application>getty</application> command has been
  re-implemented numerous times.  There is a wide selection of
  <application>getty</application> clones, each with slight
  differences in behavior and syntax.  We will describe the
  traditional <application>getty</application>, and then some popular
  alternatives.</para>

  <para>One of the jobs of a <application>getty</application> is to
  set the <varname>TERM</varname> environment variable to indicate the
  make and model of the terminal which is connecting.  In this
  <citetitle>HOWTO</citetitle> we set the terminal to the commonly
  emulated <productname><acronym>DEC</acronym>
  <acronym>VT100</acronym></productname>.  If you occassionally
  connect using a different terminal emulation then you can
  interactively change your choice of terminal by setting
  <varname>TERM</varname> to the appropiate terminal listed in
  <filename>/etc/termcap</filename>.</para>

</screen>
  </figure>

  <para>A <application>getty</application> is also responsible for
  setting the time zone when a permanently-connected remote terminal
  is located beyond the machine's default time zone.  The
  <application>getty</application> overrides the default timezone by
  setting the <envar>TZ</envar> environment variable.  As with the
  <envar>TERM</envar> environment variable, a user connecting from a
  modem can interactively override the default time zone.</para>

    <para>With all the talk about zero day exploits and sometimes
    esoteric vulnerabilities its easy to lose sight of the role of
    older, less sophisticated techniques as a mainstay of cracker
    activity.</para>

    <para>During a hacking debate at InfoSecurity Europe yesterday
    [2002-04-25], black hat hacker KP said that when he broke into a
    network he did so 90 per cent of the time through an unprotected
    modem, often through war dialling.</para>

    <para>War dialling involves systematically trying to locate the
    numbers associated with corporate modems through testing each
    extension of a corporate phone system in turn.</para>

    <para><quote>Intrusion detection systems are no real deterrent for
    me because I get in through the back door,</quote> he
    said. <quote>Many networks are constructed like Baked Alaska
    &mdash; crunchy on the outside and soft in the

    <para>Coldfire, another cracker speaking at the debate, said he
    too only used social engineering (persuading people to give
    confidential information over the phone), against telco
    suppliers.</para>

    <para><quote>Hackers don't like talking to people - remember we're
    socially inadequate,</quote> he joked.</para>

    <para>In response to customer demand, security testing specialists
    NTA Monitor this week launched a service to test against war
    dialling vulnerability.</para>

    <para><quote>This isn't particularly sexy,</quote> said NTA
    Monitor's technical director Roy Hills. <quote>But we're seeing
    high demand for this low-tech service.</quote></para>

    <para>The issue of war dialling and insecure modem connections was
    highlighted last month when BT inadvertently published the private
    remote access numbers of thousands of its customers on its Web
    site. The list was supposed to include the dial up numbers of
    ISPs, but modem numbers of private companies and people were
    published as well by mistake.</para>

    <para>BT swiftly pulled the information from the BT Together site
    but now before the monster telco earned brickbats from security

   <para>Anyone that can guess the <acronym>BIOS</acronym> password,
   the boot loader password, or the <systemitem

   a search engine.<footnote>

   <para>Guessing a user's password is only slightly less severe, as a

   envelope in the care of the guard post with instructions to treat
   the envelope with the same procedures used for the site's master
   keys.  Smaller sites can use a safe, a cash box or a locked drawer.
   A thief forcing a locked drawer still leaves shows more apparent
   signs of entry and more clues to their identity than is left by a

   <para>These three passwords are an important corporate asset.  If

   <title>Modem features to restrict usage</title>

   <para>Most modems support the addition of a password.  This is not
   particularly useful as it has the same strengths and weaknesses of
   all other password authentication schemes.  We already have
   password authentication in the <acronym>BIOS</acronym>, in the boot
   loader and in <application>login</application>.</para>

   <para>Many modems support call-back.  The modem is called and a few
   seconds after hang-up it calls a pre-configured number.  This
   limits the locations that can gain access to the console. </para>

   <para>Many modems support checking the calling line identification
   (CLI) against a predefined list.  If the calling number is not on
   the list then the call is cleared.  The phone line to the modem
   must be configured to send CLI, this may incur an additional charge
   from the phone company.  Not all calling phones can send CLI and
   some valid callers may have asked their phone company to suppress
   the sending of CLI.</para>

   <para>Many modems can be configured to log the calling line
   identification.  This is useful when tracing misuse.</para>

   <para>Many modems support encryption.  Some modems allow multiple
   keys.  This gives a neat solution: only authorized modems can dial
   in, but they can do so from any location.  The modems usually need
   to be of the same make, and perhaps of the same model.</para>

  <title>Configuring a kernel to support serial console</title>
  
  <para>Most <systemitem class="osname">Linux</systemitem> kernels
  shipped by distributors are configured to allow the serial console
  to be enabled.  However system administrators will almost certainly
  encounter some problems best solved by recompiling a kernel.  In
  these cases configure the kernel to support the serial console.  The
  usual virtual terminal console is also configured, as we normally
  want console messages to go a monitor as well as the serial
  port.</para>


  <section id="kernelcompile-25">
   <title>Linux kernel version 2.5</title>

   <para>Kernel version 2.5 is under active development, so this
   section may be out of date.  Version 2.5 includes support for the
   console to a serial port attached to a USB dongle.  The
   <literal>-dj</literal> patch to the version 2.5 kernel has a
   rewritten console layer; it is not known if the rewritten layer
   effects the user-space use of the serial console.</para>

   <para><acronym>RS-232</acronym> cables were originally intended to
   link terminals to modems.  The terminal is formally named a Data
   Terminal Equipment, abbreviated to <acronym>DTE</acronym>.  The modem
   is formally named a Data Communications Equipment, abbreviated to
   <acronym>DCE</acronym>.</para>

   <para>A standard <acronym>RS-232</acronym> cable has a 25-pin
   D-type socket, which connects to the <acronym>DTE</acronym>, and a
   25-pin D-type plug, which connects to the <acronym>DCE</acronym>.
   All 25 pins are connected, with pin 1 on the plug wired to pin 1 on
   the socket, pin 2 on the plug wired to pin 2 on the socket, and so
   on.  The shielding of the cable is attached to the metallic cover
   on the socket.</para>

   <para><acronym>RS-232</acronym> signaling is much more robust than
   the signalling of many other communications standards.  Pins can be
   shorted, not connected or drive more than one output.</para>

   <para>Signals are named from the point of view of the Data Terminal
   Equipment.  So Transmit Data on the <acronym>DTE</acronym> is
   connected to Transmit Data on the <acronym>DCE</acronym>.  The

   data, whereas Transmit Data pin on the <acronym>DCE</acronym>
   actually recieves data.</para>

   <title>Cable from console port to modem</title>

   <para>The <acronym>RS-232</acronym> standard defines the
   interconnection of computers and modems, so there is little to go
   wrong here by simply purchasing a pre-assembled cable.  There are
   two types of cable: cables with connectors for a standard 25-pin D
   connector on the computer; and cables with connectors for a
   proprietary 9-pin D connector used on the <acronym>IBM</acronym>
   <productname><acronym>PC/AT</acronym></productname> and many other
   computers.  The cables have titles like
   <citetitle><acronym>RS-232</acronym> 25-pin computer
   (<acronym>DTE</acronym>) to 25-pin modem
   (<acronym>DCE</acronym>)</citetitle> or
   <citetitle><acronym>RS-232</acronym> 9-pin <acronym>IBM</acronym>
   <productname><acronym>PC/AT</acronym></productname> computer
   (<acronym>DTE</acronym>) to 25-pin modem
   (<acronym>DCE</acronym>)</citetitle>.  Most modems are packaged
   with a suitable cable.</para>

   <para>If you need to manufacture your own cables, see the
   <citetitle>Serial-HOWTO</citetitle> for the
   <acronym>RS-232</acronym> pinout for your computer.  Connect
   Transmit Data on the computer to Transmit Data on the modem,
   Receive Data on the computer to Receive Data on the modem, and so
   on for Signal Ground, Clear to Send, Ready to Send, Data Set Ready,
   Data Terminal Ready and Data Carrier Detect.</para>

   <para>For professional computer room installations consider routing
   the serial cable through an <acronym>RJ-45</acronym> patch panel.
   There are two common pinouts on used on the
   <acronym>RJ-45</acronym> connector: <ulink

   <ulink url="http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/701/14.html">Cisco
   2500-series</ulink>.</para>

   <para>If you create your own pinout for unshielded twisted pair
   cable then be sure that your pinout twists a Signal Ground wire
   with the Transmit Data wire and another Signal Ground wire with the
   Receive Data wire.  Although the <acronym>RS-232</acronym> signals
   are not balanced, this twist will result in the least amount of
   signal degradation and noise pickup.</para>

   <para>The <acronym>RS-232</acronym> standard allows for, but does
   not specify, the interconnection of two computers without
   intervening modems.  A special cable is required, called a
   <quote>null modem</quote> cable.</para>

   <para>The wiring within the null modem cable depends upon the
   handshaking and control signals that are needed.  Differing
   manufacturers have differing views on this topic, so don't buy a
   null modem cable that does not come with a wiring diagram.</para>

   <para>Linux needs all of the flow control and modem control signals
   to be correctly wired.  The correct wiring of a null modem cable is
   shown in <xref linkend="serial-pc-terminal-cable-good1"> with an
   alternative shown in <xref
   linkend="serial-pc-terminal-cable-good2">.</para>

   <para>Linux uses <acronym>CTS</acronym> and <acronym>RTS</acronym> to
   do handshaking, preventing the computer from overrunning the
   terminal and preventing the terminal from overrunning the computer.
   If you are connecting two computers together, then you will not get
   reliable file transfers without
   <acronym>CTS</acronym>/<acronym>RTS</acronym> handshaking.</para>

   <para>Linux uses <acronym>DSR</acronym> and <acronym>DCD</acronym> to
   sense that a terminal is connected.  It will then request a login.
   If a session is established and <acronym>DCD</acronym> falls then
   Linux will log out the user.</para>

   <para>Linux uses <acronym>DTR</acronym> to force the link to be
   cleared.  It does this after a user logs off to free up the
   communications channel.</para>

   <para>Either of the null modem designs in <xref

   may be marginally better when both computers are remotely located,
   as the differing states of <acronym>DSR</acronym> and
   <acronym>DCD</acronym> can be used to determine which end of the
   null modem cable has become faulty.</para>

   <para>All null modem designs have a common flaw.  Computers
   interconnected with real modems modem will drop Data Set Ready for
   some time after the local modem is reset by the local computer
   dropping Data Terminal Ready.  Most software is designed to
   accomodate this slight difference between modem links and null

   handshaking in your terminal emulation software.</para>

   <para>In the worst case for a null modem you will need a cable that

   these cables in a production environment.</para>

   <para>The <acronym>RS-232</acronym> standard 9600bps port will
   drive 15 metres of shielded cable.  More precisely, an
   <acronym>RS-232</acronym> line driver will operate against a
   capacitance of up to 2500 picoFarad with low enough skew to allow a
   9600bps signal to be recovered.</para>

   <para>If you select a cable with lower capacitance you can drive

   <citetitle><acronym>ANSI/TIA/EIA-568-A</acronym></citetitle>
   unshielded twisted pair category 5 cable has a maximum capacitiance
   of 55<acronym>pF</acronym> per metre, so this popular
   <quote><acronym>UTP</acronym> cat 5</quote> cable can be safely
   driven up to 45m.  Beyond that you should check the cable
   manufacturers specifications for the actual <quote>shunt
   capacitance</quote> (a common figure is 47.5
   <acronym>pF/m</acronym>, giving a maximum cable length of about
   50<acronym>m</acronym>).  However long runs of unshielded cable

   <para>If you are comfortable in working beyond specifications then
   you might note that the experience of enterprise network operators
   has been that structured cabling layout in buildings is limited by
   the 100m distance limitation of fast ethernet over category 5
   cable, not by the practical distances achieved by RS-232
   asynchronous signals at 9600bps over category 5 cable.</para>

   <para>For longer distances use an <acronym>RS-232</acronym> line
   driver; these will typically drive up to 2000 meters over category
   3 <acronym>UTP</acronym> cable.  For greater distances consider
   using fiber optical modems, the global telephony system, the mobile
   telephony system, satellite or radio.</para>

  <section id="serial-manufacture">
   <title>Making serial cables</title>

   <para>If you use a serial console for densely-racked computers you
   will end up making a lot of null-modem serial cables.  This section
   has some hints on making serial cables.  If you are making more
   than ten cables and live in a city you will probably find it
   economic to have the cables made by a specialty cabling
   firm.</para>

   <para>Attempt to minimise noise in your cabling design.  Many BIOSs
   and boot loaders will wait forever if they receive a single
   character of line noise.  You might choose to use shielded UTP
   cables (these require special RJ-45 plugs but use standard RJ-45
   sockets).</para>

   <para>If the environment has a lot of radio frequency noise then
   use traditional shielded cable and metal RS-232 connector shells.
   Connect the shield in the cable to the computer at
   <emphasis>one</emphasis> end.  This can be done by connecting the
   drain wire of the shield it to the Protective Ground (if present)
   or by soldering the drain wire to the shell of the connector.  If
   there is a substantial amount of noise also place a ferrite core
   over the shielded cable at both ends of the cable.  Follow the
   usual good practices of making the cable to the correct length and
   screwing home the D connectors into the chassis.</para>

   <para>If you are making one of these cables and have some soldering
   skill, you can easily do the jumpering of the signal wires within
   the backshell of the <acronym>DB9</acronym> or
   <acronym>DB25</acronym> connector.</para>

   <para>If you are making a large number of cables then crimping
   systems are much faster than soldering.  Again, pin jumpering can
   be done within the backshell.</para>

   <para>No matter what system is adopted, use the Resistance setting
   of a multimeter to check for dead and shorted pins.  A minute here
   can save hours later.</para>

   <para>For structured cabling systems, space is tight within
   <acronym>DB9/RJ-45</acronym> backshells, so the jumpering is better
   done behind the patch panel.  The <acronym>DB9/RJ-45</acronym>
   connectors present the <productname><acronym>IBM</acronym>
   <acronym>PC</acronym></productname> pinout at the DB9 connector and
   present the Yost or Cisco pinout at the <acronym>RJ-45</acronym>
   connector.</para>

   <caution id="caution-structuredcabling">
    <title>Incompatible devices in structured cabling systems</title>

    <para>Take care to connect only <acronym>RS-232</acronym> devices
    to <acronym>RS-232</acronym> devices when patching structured
    cabling systems.  Other cables may be carrying ethernet,

   <para>A dumb modem is configured using hardware. <xref

   <para>The modem's speed is set to the desired bit rate, in our case
   9600<abbrev>bps</abbrev>.  The modem's mode is set to Answer,
   that is, to wait for incoming calls and to answer them.</para>

   <para>If the <acronym>RS-232</acronym> control line Data Terminal
   Ready is low, the modem will not answer a call.  The computer is
   off or the computer's serial interface is not yet initialized.
   Once <acronym>DTR</acronym> is high the modem will answer incoming
   calls.</para>

   <para>Once an incoming call is established the modem raises the
   Data Carrier Detect control line.  Only when DCD is high is
   received data valid (data receieved from a dumb modem when DCD is
   not asserted is probably line noise).  Only when DCD is high is
   transmitted data passed through the link.</para>

   <para><application>getty</application> on the Linux computer has
   been waiting for <acronym>DCD</acronym> to come high, and
   <application>getty</application> welcomes the user and requests
   them to log in.</para>

   <para>Whilst the user is logged in and data is flowing, Clear to
   Send and Ready to Send are used between the modem and the computer
   to prevent data being sent too soon.  The computer lowers Ready to
   Send when it is too busy to receive a character.  The modem lowers
   Clear to Send when it is too busy to receive a character.</para>

   <para>When the user hangs up, Data Carrier Detect falls and the
   hang up signal is sent to all processes associated with the dial in
   session.</para>

   <para>Alternatively, the user can log out.  When the shell dies,
   the computer pulls Data Terminal Ready low, causing the modem to
   hang up.  When the <application>getty</application> brings Data
   Terminal Ready high again, the modem will accept more incoming
   calls.</para>

   <para>We have not yet described Data Set Ready.  This line is low
   if the modem is off or if the modem has not yet initialized.  When
   DSR is low all other signals from the modem are undefined.  For
   example, if DSR is low but DCD "floats" to the high voltage then
   software should behave as if DCD is not asserted.</para>

    The time that <application>getty</application> holds

   <para>Be careful not to confuse an internal modem with a WinModem.

   <para>A <quote>WinModem</quote> incorporates the

   class="osname">Windows</systemitem></productname> device
   drivers. These device drivers presented the illusion of a serial
   port attached to a Hayes <acronym>AT</acronym>-style modem.  For a

  <title>Upgrading <productname>Red Hat Linux</productname> from a
  serial console</title>

  <para>Upgrades to Linux distributions are frequently released.  A
  machine is not remotely manageable unless these upgrades can be
  installed without needing to physically touch the machine.</para>

  <para>This section examines the remote installation and remote
  upgrade of <productname>Red Hat Linux</productname>.</para>

  <para><productname>Red Hat Linux</productname> can be installed over
  the network from a <acronym>HTTP</acronym> server using an install
  diskette.  We modify this diskette to use the serial console.  If we
  can control whether to boot from this diskette or from the hard disk
  then we can remotely upgrade the Red Hat Linux distribution from the
  serial port.  If a blank diskette is placed in the drive when the
  machine is deployed then no on-site intervention is needed to
  upgrade the operating system.</para>

  <para>If you have upgrade procedures for other
  <systemitem class="osname">Linux</systemitem> distributions please contribute
  them to the <citetitle>HOWTO</citetitle> maintainer.</para>


  <section id="rhl-selectboot">
   <title>Select boot disk</title>

   <para>The key to a remote upgrade is to be able to boot from floppy
   disk to perform the upgrade, and then to reboot from the hard disk.
   The possibilities are:</para>

   <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>Most <acronym>BIOSs</acronym> allow the boot disk order to be
     controlled through the <acronym>BIOS</acronym>' configuration.  If
     the <acronym>BIOS</acronym> supports a serial console then the
     machine can be upgraded whilst leaving the floppy disk in the
     drive.  No one need attend the site to upgrade the operating
     system</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>Someone can insert a floppy disk before the upgrade and
     remove it afterwards.  Most co-location sites will provide this
     level of <quote>board-swap</quote> technical support.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>Two records of the CMOS memory which stores the
     <acronym>BIOS</acronym> configuration can be made: one for booting
     from floppy and another for booting from hard disk.
     Unfortunately the nvram device driver does not yet work on a wide
     enough variety of machines for this HOWTO to pursue this option
     further.</para>

  <section id="rhl-biosserial">
   <title>Configure the <acronym>BIOS</acronym> to use the serial
   port</title>

   <para>Many servers allow the <acronym>BIOS</acronym> to be configured
   from the serial port, especially on systems designed for rack
   mounting.  At the moment few machines designed to be used as
   desktop systems allow the <acronym>BIOS</acronym> to be accessed from
   the serial port.</para>

   <para>Refer to your vendor's documentation to set the
   <acronym>BIOS</acronym> to use the serial port.  Some vendors call
   this feature <quote>console redirection</quote>.  Unfortunately, the
   meaning of this term varies by vendor.  Some vendors use it to mean
   the redirection of the <acronym>VGA</acronym> output and keyboard
   to a remote <acronym>PC</acronym> using a proprietary serial
   protocol.  This feature can only be used in conjunction with the
   <systemitem class="osname">Linux</systemitem> serial console if the
   <acronym>BIOS</acronym> can be instructed to disable the serial
   redirection after booting.</para>

   <para>As an example of the confusion, Dell uses <quote>console
   redirection</quote> when describing the <productname>Dell
   2400</productname> and the <productname>Dell 2450</productname>.
   The <productname>Dell 2450</productname> <acronym>BIOS</acronym>
   can be configured from the serial port.  The <productname>Dell
   2400</productname>'s <quote>console redirection</quote> is
   additional hardware that remotely replicates the computer's
   <acronym>VGA</acronym> monitor and keyboard.</para>

   <para>An example of a <acronym>BIOS</acronym> configuration is given
   in <xref linkend="rhl-biosserial-example">.</para>

   <para>The computer reboots a few times during the upgrade.  These
   reboots hang up the modem. Having to dial in a number of times
   during the upgrade can become annoying. Altering the modem's
   configuration to ignore Data Terminal Ready will cause the modem

   <para>We may also wish to disconnect during the install to reduce

    the boot loader configuration file
    <filename>/mnt/floppy/syslinux.cfg</filename> to use the serial
    port.  If you are going to use the <application>vi</application>

   <application>Xconfigurator</application> manually if you do have a

  <title>Terminal server configuration</title>

  <para>Terminal servers were originally designed for connecting
  terminals to minicomputers.  Each terminal would have an
  <acronym>RS-232</acronym> port.  The connection to the minicomputer
  usually used an ethernet port.  Connecting terminals would be
  connected to a command line interface where they could select from a
  list of predefined machines.  A <application>Telnet</application>
  session would then be started to that machine.</para>

  <para>Over time terminal servers gained more features.  For example,
  modems could be connected.  These initially allowed people to dial
  in to the minicomputer but grew in features until most terminal
  servers became routers with a great number of serial ports.</para>

  <para>As well as allowing the connection of many console to a single
  terminal, the terminal server can be configured with user accounts
  and passwords, preventing unauthenticated access to the console
  whilst still allowing the console to be reached from any
  modem.</para>

  <para>This remainder of this section lists the considerations when
  purchasing terminal servers and the cabling pinouts and basic
  software configuration needed for differing types of terminal
  servers.</para>

  <para>Further contributions are welcome and should be e-mailed to
  the maintainer of this <citetitle>HOWTO</citetitle>.</para>


  <section id="ts-buy">
   <title>Considerations when buying second-hand terminal
   servers</title>

   <para>Internet Service Providers have been large users of terminal
   servers in the past.  Each modem would be connected to a terminal
   server port and incoming users would be permitted to send
   <acronym>IP</acronym> packets anywhere, not just to some predefined
   minicomputer.  Manufacturers renamed the equipment to <quote>access
   servers</quote> or <quote>modem servers</quote> to reflect this new
   use.</para>

   <para>These access servers have been superseded by a new generation
   which allows telephone trunks to be plugged directly into the
   <acronym>ISP</acronym>'s router.  There are no discrete modems; the
   modem tones are decoded by digital signal processing chips within
   the router.  As a result terminal servers are currently readily
   available on the second-hand market.</para>

   <para>When purchasing a second-hand terminal server ensure that you
   are also buying the rights to the software.  Some companies license
   their software and have contract terms which state that the license
   cannot be resold, but has to be repurchased from the company if the
   terminal server changes hands.</para>

   <para>Many vendors require a current maintenance contract to obtain
   software updates.  These maintenance agreements can be expensive, a
   common figure is 15% per annum of the manufacturer's retail price.
   You may be able to source a cheaper software updates from a
   third-party maintenance supplier.</para>

   <para>Many older terminal servers are no longer sold or supported
   by their vendors.  Search the vendor's web site for <quote>end of
   life</quote>.</para>

   <para>Vendor support can be a particular issue when the
   most-recently available software does not fit within the
   <acronym>RAM</acronym> or flash memory contraints of the terminal
   server you have purchased.  You should check this before purchasing
   a seond-hand terminal server.  Upgrading flash memory can be
   particularly difficult, as the <acronym>ROM</acronym> on the
   motherboard may also need to be replaced with one aware of the new
   flash memory's characteristics.<footnote>

     <para>This is a fault with the design of flash memory.  It
     identifies itself with a model designator rather than with the
     timings required to read and write the memory.  So to load
     software from flash memory the boot <acronym>ROM</acronym> must
     have a table of flash memory models and
     timings.</para></footnote></para>

   <para>Third-party parts suppliers such as <ulink
   url="http://www.kingston.com/">Kingston</ulink> or <ulink
   url="http://www.memoryx.net/">MemoryX</ulink> can usually provide
   dynamic <acronym>RAM</acronym> and flash memory.  They cannot
   usually supply <acronym>ROM</acronym>s or static
   <acronym>RAM</acronym>.</para>

   <para>Most old terminal servers will not support
   <application>Secure Shell</application>.  In this is the case
   accessing the terminal server by its ethernet port is a poor idea:
   when you login to the console you password will travel across the
   Internet in clear text.  Either dial in to the terminal server or
   use a one-time password system such as the
   <productname><acronym>RADIUS</acronym></productname> protocol with
   <productname>S/KEY</productname> authentication.</para>

   <para>An alternative to using a terminal server is to use a
   multiport serial card in another <systemitem
   class="osname">Linux</systemitem> system.</para>

   <productname>Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter with
   FIFOs</productname></citetitle></ulink>.</para>

   <para>To set the serial port and serial parameters, most
   <acronym>Linux</acronym> boot loaders use a syntax modeled upon the
   kernel's <literal>console</literal> parameter.  It would be nice to
   retain this consistency, since the user needs to learn the kernel
   syntax in any case.</para>

   <para>The default value should be 9600<abbrev>bps</abbrev>, 8 data
   bits, no parity, 1 stop bit and
   <acronym>CTS</acronym>/<acronym>RTS</acronym> flow control.  This
   gives the maximum interoperability with the other programs that use
   the serial console.</para>

   <para>Please do not ignore the lower speeds, as remote serial
   console is at its most valuable when the computer is located three
   days walk up a mountain in the New Guinea highlands.  It is
   difficult to get more than 75<abbrev>bps</abbrev> from
   <acronym>HF</acronym> radio under adverse sky conditions.</para>

   <para>Be conservative in your use of the modem status lines.  Even
   if you are ignoring incoming status (<acronym>DSR</acronym>,
   <acronym>DCD</acronym>) and handshaking lines (<acronym>RTS</acronym>)
   at least assert the outgoing status (<acronym>DTR</acronym>) and
   handshaking (<acronym>CTS</acronym>) lines.  Correctly configured
   modems will not receive calls with <acronym>DTR</acronym> low, and
   dropping <acronym>DTR</acronym> will cause the modem to hang
   up.</para>

   <para>Consider that the <acronym>BIOS</acronym> may have already
   initialised the <acronym>UART</acronym> and provide a configuration
   option to allow the boot loader to be informed of that.  When the
   boot loader initialises the <acronym>UART</acronym>,
   <acronym>DTR</acronym> will fall and the line will hang up.  In some
   scenarios each hang up requires the satelite circuit to be
   re-booked before another call can be placed. </para>

   <para>Cater for line noise.  Imagine the boot loader starting and
   then being sent nonsensical characters every few seconds.  Although
   this is certainly wrong, a fault in a modem is difficult to
   remotely diagnose and correct if the machine is left stranded at
   the boot loader prompt.  A solution is to boot the default image
   upon the expiry of a timer; the boot occurring even if the user (or
   line noise) has started to type.  For example the boot loader
   configuration could say:</para>

   <informalfigure>
<programlisting>
<lineannotation># Start the machine regardless after 30 minutes
#   30 * 60 seconds per minute * units of tenths of seconds</lineannotation>
<command>lifetime 18000</command></programlisting>
   </informalfigure>

   <para>The default should be no life timer.  The timer is also

     <para>Keep the user interface simple.  There is no need for fancy

     surprising number of these have very buggy <acronym>DEC</acronym>

    <listitem>
     <para>Don't do too much.  In <systemitem class="osname">Linux</systemitem> the
     boot loader and operating system both have explicit support for a
     serial console.  So all the <acronym>BIOS</acronym> need do is to
     support the a serial interface for itself.
     <systemitem class="osname">Linux</systemitem> has no need for a generic serial
     redirection facility.  If you do provide such a facility for
     other operating systems, please allow it to be disabled after
     system boot.</para>
