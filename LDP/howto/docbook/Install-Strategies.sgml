    <title>The basics</title> <simpara>The primary purpose of this document is
      to make the co-existance between Windows and Linux as simple and uncomplex
      as possible which means as far as Windows is concerned Linux doesn't
      exist. It is now possible to install Linux on a Windows partition as a disk
      image with what is known as the <systemitem>loopback</systemitem> filesystem
      &ndash; RedHat and Mandrake offer this &ndash; but it's an extremely bad
      idea because of the way Windows handles files. Defragmenting the system will
      become a nightmare and Linux itself will crawl and it will ruin both your
      Windows and Linux experience. The same applies to the
      <systemitem>Umsdos</systemitem> filesystem (though Linux won't crawl) and
      it's best to install Linux on a partition of its own. This document makes a
      few presumptions but nothing to worry about &ndash; just a few.</simpara>
    
    <para><itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <simpara>You are using Windows 9x (95,98) not Me or 2000.</simpara>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <simpara>You are familiar with computers <abbrev>ie</abbrev> you know
	    how to boot the system using the floppy or cdrom drive</simpara>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <simpara>You know your way around DOS and Windows</simpara>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <simpara>You know what a partition is and want to install Linux on a
	    partition of its own</simpara>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <simpara>You have a large hard disk &ndash; upward of
	    <literal>8.4</literal>&nbsp;Gb &ndash; which currently holds
	    Windows and on which you intend to install Linux (even 
	    those who with smaller disks can read on).</simpara>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    
    <simpara>With that out of the way we can begin. The first thing to do is to
      make space for Linux. Like other Linux wannabes you are likely to be stuck
      with a huge single partition with Windows on it. This would be your
      <medialabel>C</medialabel> drive. In my case it was hogging
      <literal>13.5</literal>&nbsp;gigs. You have to make a separate partition
      for Linux out of this space (which would then be labelled as
      <medialabel>D</medialabel>). You can either use Windows
      <application>Fdisk</application> which really is not a good idea as it
      would entail losing all your data and making new partitions from scratch,
      one for Windows and one for Linux, or you can take the easier and far more
      convenient way out and use a free and excellent non-destructive
      partitioning utility called <application>Fips</application>. What makes
      <application>Fips</application> special is its ability to create a new
      partition out of the free space in your <MediaLabel>C</MediaLabel>
      partition without any loss of data. The latest version of
      <application>Fips</application> (<literal>2.0</literal>) is available at
      its homepage <ulink url="http://www.igd.fhg.de/~aschaefe/fips/"></ulink>
      and most Linux distributions carry it under the 
      <filename	class="directory">/dostools</filename> or 
      <filename class="directory">/dosutils</filename> directory in the primary
      cd.</simpara>
    
    <simpara>We are going to concentrate on using
      <application>Fips</application> so if you are going to use Windows
      <application>Fdisk</application> &ndash; which actually is totally
      unnecessary unless you have just bought a new system and even then it's a
      better idea to make a single partition with Windows
      <application>Fdisk</application>, install Windows on it and then use
      <application>Fips</application> to split it for reasons that I'm going to
      explain later in this document &ndash; or a commercial partition utility
      like <application>Partition Magic</application> you are on your
      own.</simpara>

    <title>A note about hard disks and partitions</title> 

    <simpara>A hard disk can have a maximum of <literal>4</literal> primary
      partitions &ndash; don't ask me why, I don't know. Apart from primary
      partitions a hard disk can also have what is known as an extended partition
      which inturn can hold a number of logical partitions &ndash; I believe the
      number is close to <literal>15</literal>. The extended partitions are not
      real partitions like primary or logical partitions in that they don't store
      data but are actually containers for logical partitions which is where data
      is actually stored &ndash; as you can see it is uneccessarily complex. Thus
      in Windows <medialabel>C</medialabel> is a primary partition and if you used
      Windows <application>Fdisk</application> &ndash; Windows
      <application>Fdisk</application> will not make more than one primary
      partition to partition your hard disk &ndash; <medialabel>D</medialabel> is
      usually the first logical partition of the extended
      partition. <medialabel>E</medialabel> would be the second logical partition
      and so on. In Linux things are slightly different. The first primary
      partition is called <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hda1</filename>, the
      second primary partition <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hda2</filename>
      upto the fourth which is <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hda4</filename>.
      Linux refers to the an extended partition as in the case of a disk with
      <literal>1</literal> primary and one extended partition as 
      <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hda1</filename> for the primary and 
      <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hda2</filename> for the extended. The
      logical partitions of the extended partitions are referred to as 
      <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hda5</filename>, 
      <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hda6</filename> and so on. The second hard disk
      would be referred to as <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hdb</filename>,
      the third <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hdc</filename> (usually the
      cdrom drive if set as secondary master) and the fourth and last hard disk as
      <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hdd</filename> (last because the
      motherboard has place for a maximum of <literal>4</literal>
      <acronym>IDE</acronym> devices) <acronym>SCSI</acronym> devices are referred
      to as <filename class="devicefile">/dev/sda</filename> &ndash; thank god for
      that.</simpara>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1>
    <title>The concepts</title>
    
    <simpara>What <application>Fips</application> does is make a new primary
      partition out of the free space in your hard disk. This is an inherently
      dangerous operation and it's a good idea to back up all your important
      data lest something go wrong. Having said that
      <application>Fips</application> has been used successfully by a large
      number of people in different conditions and unless there is something
      already wrong with your hard disk, <acronym>FAT</acronym> (File Allocation
      Table) or partition table things will work just fine. You should read the
      <application>Fips</application> documentation.</simpara>
    
    <simpara>Before you set out to partition the hard disk you have to decide
      how you want to boot into Linux. The default and most common method is to
      use <application>Lilo</application> &ndash; a simple and basic bootloader
      program that overwrites (after saving) your hard disk's
      <acronym>MBR</acronym> (Master Boot Record) and on booting the system
      gives you a choice between booting either Windows or Linux. If you select
      Windows it boots Windows and you are met with the familiar windows screen
      or if you select Linux it boots Linux and if you don't make a choice in
      the stipulated time &ndash; could be anything from
      &plusmn;<literal>5</literal> seconds depending on how you set it up
      &ndash; it boots the default operating system, Windows or Linux, again
      depending on how you set it up. You can restore your original
      <acronym>MBR</acronym> anytime, when uninstalling Linux for instance,
      either by typing <command>/sbin/lilo <option>-u</option></command> within
      Linux or typing <command>fdisk <option>/MBR</option></command> in DOS
      (this will overwrite the <acronym>MBR</acronym> with the original Windows
      <acronym>MBR</acronym>) needless to say you would lose the option to boot
      into Linux after this and thus access to your Linux partition.</simpara>
    
    <simpara>The problem with using <application>Lilo</application> especially
      for those with large disks is you would have to give up a substantial
      chunk of your disk space to Linux. This is not a flexible solution since
      while you can access your Windows partition from within Linux &ndash; the
      large <acronym>MPEG</acronym> files can thus be stored in Windows and
      accessed by both operating systems &ndash; the alternate is not
      true.</simpara>
    
    <simpara>This is because of an arcane <acronym>BIOS</acronym> limitation
      that limits <application>Lilo</application> to the first
      <literal>1024</literal> cylinders of the hard disk. Windows and Linux have
      no such limitations &ndash; it has something to do with address
      translation and <acronym>LBA</acronym> which I have yet to fully
      understand. Suffice to know the <acronym>BIOS</acronym> cannot access data
      that is beyond this <literal>1024</literal> cylinder limit and since
      <application>Lilo</application> is dependent on the
      <acronym>BIOS</acronym> to boot the <acronym>OS</acronym>'s nor can
      it. Thus if you want to use <application>Lilo</application> to boot Linux
      you got to make sure that the Linux partition is well below the
      <literal>1024</literal> cylinder limit. My hard disk &ndash; and most
      modern hard disks have more than <literal>1024</literal> cylinders &ndash;
      has <literal>1650</literal> cylinders and using
      <application>Lilo</application> means making the Linux partition at about
      the <literal>1000</literal> or <literal>1010</literal> cylinder mark which
      translates into a whopping <literal>5.2</literal>&nbsp;Gb of
      <literal>12.9</literal>&nbsp;Gb to Linux and this wasn't working for me
      since my Linux stuff hardly need more than <literal>2</literal>&nbsp;Gb
      and my Windows data on the other hand with <acronym>MP3</acronym>'s and
      <acronym>MPEG</acronym> movies needs a lot more than
      <literal>7</literal>&nbsp;Gb.</simpara>
    
    <simpara>The solution, and in Linux there are always solutions, is
      <application>Loadlin</application>, an underrated alternative to
      <application>Lilo</application> which is inexplicably not as popular or
      widespread, inexplicable because it's far more flexible. If you intend to
      use <application>Loadlin</application> and for those with large hard-disks
      it's an excellent alternative you don't have to worry about the
      <literal>1024</literal> cylinder limit. Even better you can launch Linux
      from your Windows desktop and modify your
      <filename>autoexec.bat</filename> file to give you an option to boot into
      either of the <acronym>OS</acronym>'s during boot time not unlike
      <application>Lilo</application>. You are then free to size your partitions
      as you please. In my case a <literal>2.2</literal>&nbsp;Gb extended
      partition with <literal>3</literal> logical partitions. That's right
      <literal>3</literal> partitions. It's normal to make three partitions, one
      for the Kernel boot files, one for the root partition and one for the swap
      partition but more on that later.</simpara>

    <simpara>If you must use <application>Lilo</application> but are unwilling
      to give up a lot of space there is a solution. Place the Linux partition
      in the middle of the disk. You have to split the new partition you just
      created using <application>Fips</application> into <literal>2</literal>
      (you would have to use <application>Fips</application> once again for
      this) the first partition which falls within the <literal>1024</literal>
      cylinder limit can be used for Linux and the second you can use for
      Windows. Thus your hard disk will then have <literal>3</literal>
      partitions the first and third for Windows and the one in the middle for
      Linux. I don't like this arrangement but it's up to you. (At the moment we
      are refering to the Linux partition as one but during the installation you
      will split it into <literal>3</literal> using the Linux tools) You can
      also make a small <literal>15</literal>-<literal>20</literal>&nbsp;Mb
      <filename class="directory">/boot</filename> partition and place it before
      the <literal>1024</literal> cylinder mark and the rest of the installation
      anywhere on the hard disk but again I quite don't like this.</simpara>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Partitioning</title>

    <simpara>Now we are ready to actually partition the hard disk. First make a
      DOS boot disk (type <command>format a: <option>/s</option></command> at
      the DOS prompt or in DOS). Put the following three files in the disk,
      <filename>fips.exe</filename>, <filename>restorrb.exe</filename> and
      <filename>errors.txt</filename>. Defragment your hard disk &ndash; this
      puts all the data at the beginning leaving enough space for
      <application>Fips</application> to create a new partition from. If you use
      <application>Norton SpeedDisk</application> select the unfragment free
      space option. <application>Norton</application> usually puts data at the
      end of the disk and this will prevent <application>Fips</application> from
      creating a new partition. Run <application>Scandisk</application> and
      reboot using the bootdisk you just created.</simpara>

    <simpara>Type <command>fips</command> at the prompt and
      <application>Fips</application> will show you your partition table with a
      warning about partition table inconsistency. If your disk has more than
      <literal>1024</literal> cylinders its usually safe to ignore this
      warning. Next <application>Fips</application> will ask you is you want to
      proceed &ndash; the program is extremely meticulous &ndash; answer yes
      obviously and when prompted to save a backup of your partition table and
      boot sector answer yes &ndash; this step is absolutely vital as it allows
      you to restore your hard disk to its unpartioned single partition state
      should anything go wrong. It also comes in handy if you want to uninstall
      Linux or resize your Linux partition. It doesn't matter what happens to
      the new partition in the meantime, if you have the back up you can restore
      your hard disk to its original unpartioned state. This reversible
      operation will work in all circumstances but one; if you format your
      original (Windows) partition which was split to make space for Linux in
      the meantime, the original <acronym>FAT</acronym> is overwritten with a
      new and smaller one and the restore operation will not work.</simpara>
    
    <simpara>After making the backup you will be presented with a screen with
      <literal>3</literal> numbers, the first represents your original partition
      &ndash; notice it is at its smallest size, <application>Fips</application>
      has allocated all free space in the hard disk to the new partition, this
      is the default behavior. The second column shows the cylinder info which
      will be the guide for those who plan to use
      <application>Lilo</application>. The third shows the size of the new
      partition you are going to create &ndash; it is at its largest size. Use
      the arrow keys to resize the partition, you would just have to reduce the
      size of the new partition since it is at its maximum to a size you
      want. For <application>Lilo</application> users the new partition has to
      be below the <literal>1024</literal> cylinder mark,
      <literal>1000</literal> is a reasonable beginning for the new
      partition. After you are satisfied with the size of your new partition
      press enter, <application>Fips</application> will ask you to confirm and
      write the new partition table.</simpara>
    
    <simpara>Reboot your system. Remember to change the <acronym>BIOS</acronym>
      settings to boot from the hard disk or you will end up rebooting with the
      floppy. Double click <guiicon>My Computer</guiicon> and you will see the
      result of all the hard work, there will be a new drive labelled
      <medialabel>D</medialabel> alongside the original
      <medialabel>C</medialabel>. Don't touch <medialabel>D</medialabel>, run
      <application>scandisk</application> on your original partition
      (<medialabel>C</medialabel>) &ndash; hopefully there will be no errors
      &ndash; and at this point you are ready to install Linux.</simpara>

    <simpara>Some of the Linux documentation mistakenly ask you to delete the
      newly created partition using Windows <application>Fdisk</application>. Do
      not commit that blunder because if you do the Linux partitions will show
      up in <guiicon>My Computer</guiicon> when you reboot after installing
      Linux and since Windows obviously cannot read these drives and the
      <acronym>ext2</acronym> filesystem, using
      <application>Explorer</application> and acessing your hard disk in Windows
      will become a time consuming and destabilizing affair. So don't do
      it.</simpara>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Installation</title>

    <simpara>Reboot using your Linux Installation CD &ndash; I use Redhat 6.2 which is
      fairly straight forward and I will focus on it. Most Linux distributions
      have really worked on their installation programs and you shouldn't have a
      problem. Just have the details about your hardware in hand, the horizontal
      and vertical refresh rate of your monitor in case the installation program
      doesn't automatically detect it ( you will find the exact figures in the
      manual ), the video card, its memory type ( <acronym>SDRAM</acronym> or
      <acronym>SGRAM</acronym> ) and size, and your mouse type &ndash;
      <acronym>PS2</acronym> or Serial. As I mentioned earlier you will have to
      make about <literal>3</literal> partitions for Linux, you can make more
      but <literal>3</literal> is the recommended number. There are
      <literal>3</literal> main installation types,
      <emphasis>Workstation</emphasis>, <emphasis>Server</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>Custom</emphasis>. The Server class install erases everything in
      the hard disk so beware. The workstation and custom installs have
      sub-classes but that's for you to explore.</simpara>

    <simpara><application>Loadlin</application> users have to select custom
      installation and dump <application>Lilo</application> when given the
      oppurtunity because the other types of installations install
      <application>Lilo</application> by default and without asking and we dont
      want that do we? <application>Lilo</application> users have no
      restrictions; you can opt for whichever install type you like.</simpara>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>The <application>Lilo</application> way</title>

    <simpara><application>Lilo</application> fans can use <application>Disk
	Druid</application> which is RedHat's default partitioning utility
      &ndash; yes we haven't finished with partitioning just yet. First delete
      the second partition which will show up in 
      <application>Disk Druid</application>'s screen as 
      <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hda2.</filename> Then create a new
      partiton, set its mount point to 
      <filename class="directory">/boot</filename> and size to
      <literal>16</literal>&nbsp;Mb. Create the second partition and set its
      mount point to <filename class="directory">/</filename>(that's called the
      root partition) and size to <emphasis>growable</emphasis>. This tells
      <application>Disk Druid</application> to reclaim all free space after you
      have finshed partititoning . Create the third partition and set its mount
      point to <systemitem>swap</systemitem> and size to about
      <literal>127</literal>&nbsp;Mb presuming you have
      <literal>64</literal>&nbsp;Mb <acronym>RAM</acronym>, those with less can
      make a <literal>64</literal>&nbsp;Mb swap partition.</simpara>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1>
    <title>The <application>Loadlin</application> way</title>

    <simpara>Those who intend to use <application>Loadlin</application> however
      cannot use <application>Disk Druid</application>, they will have to use
      Linux <application>Fdisk</application> which may have an intimidating
      reputation but is actually pretty simple. When presented with the
      <guilabel>installation type</guilabel> screen select
      <guibutton>custom</guibutton> and with <guibutton>fdisk</guibutton> (you
      will find a small button with <guibutton>fdisk</guibutton> on it at the
      top of the screen). For some reason <application>Disk Druid</application>
      doesn't let you proceed with the installation if your 
      <filename class="directory">/boot</filename> partition is above the
      <literal>1024</literal> cylinder limit so if you try to use it to create
      the partitions the install program will refuse to
      proceed. <application>Fdisk</application> is a pretty straight forward
      program and easy to use too. First you have to delete the partition you
      just created using <application>Fips</application>. Many people don't
      understand why they have to delete the partition they just created at
      considerable risk. This new partition is actually a
      <acronym>FAT32</acronym> partiton which Linux cannot use and when you
      delete it, it doesn't revert to being a part of <medialabel>C</medialabel>
      but is actually <guilabel>UNPARTITIONED FREE SPACE</guilabel> which you
      can use to create new partitions.</simpara>
    
    <simpara>You have to understand a few <application>Fdisk</application>
      operations, typing <keycap>m</keycap> lists all the options, typing
      <keycap>p</keycap> at the prompt shows you the current partition table,
      <keycap>d</keycap> deletes a partiton, <keycap>n</keycap> creates a
      partition, <keycap>q</keycap> quits without saving changes so if you make
      any mistakes there is nothing to worry about just type <keycap>q</keycap>
      and start all over again, <keycap>w</keycap> writes changes to the
      partition table use only after you are sure and <keycap>L</keycap> shows
      you the hex numbers for different partition types but you only need to
      know <literal>2</literal>, <symbol>Linux native</symbol> is hex number
      <constant>83</constant> and <symbol>Linux swap</symbol> is hex number
      <constant>82</constant>. So why do you need the Hex numbers? While
      <application>Disk Druid</application> allows you to mount a swap partition
      without going into the hex numbers in <application>Fdisk</application> the
      only way to make a swap partiton is to give it its correct hex number
      which is <constant>82</constant>.</simpara>

    <simpara>Let's start, in <application>Fdisk</application> type
      <keycap>p</keycap> at the prompt and you will see the current partition
      table. Type <keycap>d</keycap> and select the partition you want to delete
      which in this case would be 
      <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hda2</filename> (just type <literal>2</literal>)
      type <keycap>p</keycap> again and you will see the change reflected in the
      partition table. There will now be a single <acronym>FAT32</acronym>
      partition <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hda1</filename> (which is
      actually <medialabel>C</medialabel>). Type <keycap>n</keycap> to create a
      new partition and for <prompt>type of partition</prompt> the choices being
      <emphasis>primary</emphasis> or <emphasis>extended</emphasis> select
      <keycap>e</keycap>. There is no hard and fast rule about this for instance
      you could have a primary partition for 
      <filename class="directory">/boot</filename> and an extended partition
      holding two logical partitions <filename class="directory">/</filename> and
      <systemitem>swap</systemitem>. I recommend an extended partition that
      holds three logical partitions. Now you have to size your extended
      partition properly since it's a container for the three logical
      partitions. From now on you just have to respond to
      <application>Fdisk</application>. It will ask you to set the size of the
      extended partition that you want to create. This partition will start
      where your Windows partition ends and ends at the end of the disk. You can
      either give the size in <acronym>M</acronym> (megabytes) in cylinder
      numbers or in <acronym>K</acronym> (kilobytes). Just accept the default
      for the start of the partition and select the end cylinder number for the
      end &ndash; <application>Fdisk</application> will give you the end
      cylinder number.</simpara>

    <simpara>Repeat the operation for the three logical partitions, only this
      time you would have to select logical instead of extended and the
      appropriate sizes which are <literal>16</literal>&nbsp;Mb for the boot
      partition, <literal>127</literal>&nbsp;Mb for the swap partition (the size
      of the swap partition is variable depending on installed
      <acronym>RAM</acronym>, double your <acronym>RAM</acronym> is recommended)
      and the rest of the free space for the root 
      ( <filename class="directory">/</filename> ) partition. Find your way
      &ndash; it's simple, really! After creating the three partitions type
      <keycap>p</keycap> and you will see the partitions you just created. There
      will be <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hda2</filename> (extended)
      <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hda5</filename> (logical) 
      <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hda6</filename> (logical) and 
      <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hda7</filename> (logical). There is just
      one thing left to do, set the hex number for the swap partition. Type
      <keycap>t</keycap> and select the <literal>127</literal>&nbsp;Mb partition
      you created which would be 
      <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hda6</filename> enter
      <constant>6</constant> for the partition number and
      <constant>82</constant> for the hex number (you will be prompted) and you
      have just finished with partitioning. Type <keycap>w</keycap> after making
      sure and <application>Fdisk</application> will write the new partition
      table and exit. The next screen will be the 
      <application>Disk Druid</application> screen our
      <application>Lilo</application> friends 
      have already seen and you just have to mount the partitions with
      <application>Disk Druid</application>. Select 
      <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hda5</filename> (the
      <literal>16</literal>&nbsp;Mb partition) and mount it as 
      <filename class="directory">/boot</filename>. Select 
      <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hda7</filename> and mount it as 
      <filename class="directory">/</filename> (the root partition)</simpara>

    <title>Rebooting</title>

    <simpara>The rest of the installation is straight forward and requires no
      hand holding. Select the packages you want, make the boot disk when given
      the oppurtunity to (absolutely essential especially for
      <application>Loadlin</application> users) and reboot the
      system. <application>Lilo</application> users should press
      <userinput>dos</userinput> at the <application>Lilo</application> prompt
      to boot into Windows. Like promised none of the Linux partitions will be
      visible to Windows and we can all rest in peace for
      that. <application>Lilo</application> users should reboot the system and
      boot into linux this time by typing <userinput>linux</userinput> at the
      <application>Lilo</application> prompt and depending on the choices you
      made you will either be at the console or the
      <application>gnome</application> or <application>kde</application>
      desktop. From one amateur to another it's always a good idea to log into
      the console first and not graphically and then starting
      <application>X</application> because if <application>X</application>
      crashes on you still have access to the system to make amends.
      <application>Lilo</application> is set to boot into Linux by default after
      a gap of <literal>5</literal> seconds, you can change the default to
      Windows by editing the <filename>lilo</filename> file in 
     <filename class="directory">/etc</filename>. Look for the line that says
      <emphasis>default=linux</emphasis> and change it to
      <token>dos</token>. Alternative launch <application>lilo</application>
      from an <application>xterm</application> and change the asterisk from
      <token>linux</token> to <token>dos</token> (use the arrow buttons,
      dummy). That's set now for <application>Lilo</application>
      users.</simpara>

    <title>Setting up <application>Loadlin</application></title>

    <para><application>Loadlin</application> users still have a little work to
      do. First boot into Linux with the floppy. If you logged in graphically
      start a terminal emulator like <application>xterm</application> or some
      other. There are always a couple of these under the utilities menu. Type
      <command>mkdir /mnt/dosc</command>. This is the first step to make your
      Windows partition accessble to Linux and this is particularly important
      for <application>Loadlin</application> users as it is the easiest way to
      tranfer the Linux kernel to your Windows partition. Next start
      <application>linuxconf</application> from the system menu or the
      <application>xterm</application> and look for the filesystem menu. Expand
      <guibutton>accesss local drives</guibutton> and select
      <guibutton>add</guibutton>. Type <userinput>/dev/hda1</userinput> in the
      partition field, <userinput>vfat</userinput> in the type field and
      <userinput>/mnt/dosc/</userinput> in the mount point field and mount the
      partition. Alternatively you can directly edit the
      <filename>fstab</filename> file in
      <filename class="directory">/etc</filename> in a text editor
      (<application>Gedit</application> is a good choice) and add the following
      line exactly as shown.

      <programlisting>/dev/hda1    /mnt/dosc    vfat    defaults    0  0</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>This should give you access to your Windows partition, it will be in
      <filename class="directory">/mnt/dosc/</filename>. Copy the linux kernel
      to your <medialabel>C</medialabel> directory and rename it to
      <filename>vmlinuz</filename>. You will find it in 
      <filename class="directory">/boot</filename> and probably called
      <wordasword>vmlinuz</wordasword> followed by your kernel version number in
      my case <filename>vmlinuz-2.2.14-5.0</filename>. Do not copy the 
      <filename class="symlink">vmlinuz</filename> with an arrow in it, its a
      symbolic link. Reboot into windows, get the
      <application>loadlin</application> package from the Linux cd &ndash; it
      will be in the <filename class="directory">/dostools/utils</filename>
      subdirectory. Unzip it and place <filename>Loadlin.exe</filename> in the
      <medialabel>C</medialabel> directory. <application>Loadlin</application>
      and the kernel can be anywhere on your windows partition but for the time
      being we will leave it in root directory of Windows. Now its up to you how
      you want to boot into Linux. Read the <application>loadlin</application>
      documentation for the details. The roundabout way is to restart the system
      in <acronym>DOS</acronym> mode and type:
      
      <screen><prompt>C:&gt;</prompt> <userinput>loadlin vmlinuz root=/dev/hda7 ro</userinput></screen>
    </para>
    
    <simpara>This will boot you into Linux. The easier way is to make a
      <filename>.bat</filename> file with the same information and placing it on
      your desktop. Open <application>notepad</application> type
      <userinput>c:\loadlin c:\vmlinuz root=/dev/hda7 ro</userinput> and save
      the file as <filename>linux.bat</filename>, right click the file, select
      <guisubmenu>advanced</guisubmenu>, and check the msdos mode and warn
      settings. Make a shortcut to this file and put it on your desktop. The
      next time you want to boot into Linux just double click this file and you
      will be in &ndash; talk about convenience.</simpara>
    
    <para>If you want to be prompted to boot into linux before Windows boots
      like the <application>Lilo</application> guys you have to make another
      <filename>.bat</filename> file and call it from your
      <filename>autoexec.bat</filename> file. It's very simple and the details
      are available in the <application>Loadlin</application> documentation. The
      file looks a bit like this.
      
      <programlisting>
	@echo off
	cls
	echo.
	echo.
	echo.
	echo.
	choice /t:n,5 "Do you wish to boot Linux?"
	if errorlevel 2 goto End
	c:\loadlin c:\vmlinuz  root=/dev/hda6  ro
	End
      </programlisting>
      <emphasis>(This little script has been filched from the
	<application>Loadlin</application> documentation which you would know if
	you did the sensible thing and read the documentation)</emphasis>
    </para>
    
    <simpara>Save this text as <filename>linux.bat</filename> or if there
      already is a <filename>linux.bat</filename> in your Windows root directory
      you can place it in another directory or give it another name. Add the
      following line to your <filename>autoexec.bat</filename> file
      <userinput>c:\linux '</userinput>(or whatever you have named the
      <filename>.bat</filename> file). The main thing if you are using a
      <filename>.bat</filename> file is to tell
      <application>Loadlin</application> where to find the kernel image file
      (<filename>vmlinuz</filename>). The above <filename>.bat</filename> file
      gives you the option to boot into Linux before Windows loads by typing
      <keycap>y</keycap> (for Linux) or <keycap>n</keycap> (for Windows) within
      five seconds at which point it boots Windows. Enjoy.</simpara>

    <title>Removing Linux and restoring your Windows partition to its Original
      state</title>

    <simpara>Depending on whether you are using <application>Lilo</application>
      or <application>Loadlin</application> the method differs
      slightly. <application>Lilo</application> users have to first restore
      their original <acronym>MBR</acronym> either by typing <command>/sbin/lilo
	<option>-u</option></command> within Linux or typing <command>fdisk
	<option>/MBR</option></command> in <acronym>DOS</acronym>. The next steps
      are common for both <application>Loadlin</application> and
      <application>Lilo</application> users. These are not really neccessary but
      just to be on the safe side I do them all the same.</simpara>

    <simpara>Boot using the Linux installation CD and type <userinput>Linux
	expert</userinput> at the first prompt, answer whatever you wish to the
      next questions until you get to the install selection screen. Here select
      <emphasis>Install</emphasis> and <emphasis>With Fdisk</emphasis> and use
      <application>Fdisk</application> to delete all Linux partitions. Write the
      changes to disk and
      <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>&ndash;<keycap>Alt</keycap>&ndash;<keycap>Delete</keycap>
      your way out of the installation program or reset your system to
      reboot. Remember to change the <acronym>BIOS</acronym> settings to boot
      from the hard disk or else you will reboot from the
      <acronym>CDROM</acronym> again.</simpara>

    <simpara>Reboot once again, this time with the
      <application>fips</application> disk that has the backup of your partition
      table and boot sector &ndash; you saved it, didn't you? &ndash; and type
      <command>restorrb</command> at the prompt. Answer
      <userinput>yes</userinput> to the question, the program will restore your
      partition table and boot sector and you can pat yourself on the back for
      accomplishing the impossible &ndash; reclaiming lost partition space! This
      is all the more reason for making sure that the crucial backup file
      (<filename>Rootboot.000</filename>) is saved in at least
      <literal>5</literal> different locations. You can never be too
      careful. Reboot back into Windows and run
      <application>scandisk</application> on the newly increased
      <medialabel>C</medialabel> drive. It will report one error in the
      <systemitem>fsinfo</systemitem> sector which is just a used and free space
      accounting error. Your Linux data is now naturally lost for
      ever. Hopefully this procedure won't be neccessary unless you are
      increasing space allocated to Linux or getting rid of Windows.</simpara>

    <simpara>It's a good idea to upgrade your <application>Xserver</application>

     <ulink url="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/">ftp.xfree86.org/</ulink>. It provides direct

      cards and those with Nvidia cards are in luck for not only does
      <application>X 4.01</application> natively provide excellent support for
      most of their cards but Nvidia have made available high performance

    <title>The State of Linux &ndash; What to Expect</title>

    <simpara>Programmers and Enthusiasts &ndash; For programmers Linux is already a
      near perfect solution. No other system gives so offers you a wider array of
      tools and platforms for development. The flexibility is simply amazing and
      it doesn't carry a price tag. An added benefit is the sense of community and
      that's priceless.</simpara>
    
    <simpara>Enthusiasts never had it so good. There is aways something new to
      discover and since the system is totally transparent your chances of
      understanding computing and programming in general &ndash; you will be
      interested if you aren't already &ndash; are infinitely higher than in
      Windows. Tinkering will never be the same again.</simpara>

    <simpara>For the home user &ndash; There are <literal>5</literal> separate
      areas here, the internet, 
      gaming, basic word processing, administration and multimedia. We aren't
      going to talk about ease of use here because the days of an ugly and
      unwieldy interface are long gone, at the moment as far as usability and
      sheer visual pizazz is concerned <application>Gnome</application> has
      taken the pants off Windows so 
      there is nothing to worry about there. File management, installing and
      uninstalling software and basic administration are more streamlined and
      centralized and as you use Linux more you probably will get over any
      prejudice toward the command line which is nothing like the impotent 
      <acronym>DOS</acronym> prompt. This is an outrageously powerful shell that
      will accomplish anything 
      you can think off faster than it takes you to select a button. You might be
      intimidated at first but its the heart of Linux the control centre, the
      headquarters, your direct line to the kernel. Hardware configuration is not
      as simple as in Windows mostly because plug and play has complicated things
      not eased them but it's not difficult either, the best thing to do is set
      your <acronym>BIOS</acronym> to <emphasis>non pnp</emphasis> so that it
      can configure things especially the sound 
      card, but <emphasis role="bold">read read read</emphasis>. There is a lot
      of documentation on your system and with that behind you everything
      becomes simple. There is no excuse for ignorance.</simpara>

	<application>Wordperfect 9</application> , <application>8</application>
	is free, good and available. Other options are 
	<application>Applixware</application> and <application>Star
	  Office</application>. I haven't used <application>Applix</application>
	but <application>Star Office</application> is really ugly and slow and
	just the sort of software that could put you off Linux and its just as
	bad in Windows. Version 5.1 was tolerable but after Sun took it over its
	deteriorated and version 5.2 is the pits. Plain text and html editors are
	sprouting by the day. Most distribution carry a lot of software so
	look. I'm not much of a spreadsheet person but there is 
	<application>GNUmeric</application> which is
	not unlike <application>Excel</application> and a glaring inadequacy in

	<acronym>mpeg1</acronym> players are <acronym>GL</acronym> accelerated
	and perhaps my vcd playsback as well as 
	<application>Windows Media Player</application>. Ripping is a reality
	with a lot of options &nbsp; no more <acronym>ASPI</acronym> headaches
	&ndash; most of the Linux apps read digital data directly from 
	the discs and all the popular codecs are available;
	<application>Xing</application>, <application>Fraunhofer</application> but I 
	use <application>Blade</application> and <application>Lame</application>
	&ndash; two excellent freeware encoders avalible for all 
	platforms. There are also a couple of tools for cdwriting. Check some of
	the Linux archives.</simpara>

    <sect2><title>Internet</title>
      
      <simpara>Again things are really happening here though one wishes there
	were a few more browsers other than <application>Netscape</application>
	but then <application>Netcape</application> is adequate. There are all
	the other stuff you will find for Windows, chat utils, instant
	messaging, ftp, downLoaders etc.</simpara>

    <sect2><title>Games</title>
      
      <simpara>The problem area is games, there is a project on to port
	popular games to Linux by Lokigames and they have a number of titles
	ready &ndash;
	<ulink url="http://www.lokigames.com/"></ulink> &ndash;
	<application>Quake</application> 
	2&3 are out, <application>System Shock</application>,
	<application>Heavygear</application> etc. The thing here is to make 
	sure you have at least <application>Xfree 4.01</application> and support
	for your video card.</simpara>

    <sect2><title>Desktop Publishing</title>
      
      <simpara>That leaves us with <acronym>DTP</acronym> and this is one area
	where Linux could pound Windows but the thrust has been missing. Linux could
	really be optimized for
	<acronym>DTP</acronym>. <application>Ghostscript</application> - a
	PostScript RIP &ndash; already 
	offers a professional (if you know how) solution for printing and your
	printer is probably supported. If you already have a postscript
	printer there is no problem to start with. For image editing there is
	<application>Gimp</application>. It is nearly as good as 
	<application>Photoshop</application> &ndash; and
	that's some compliment &ndash;
	but for lack of <acronym>CMYK</acronym> and colour management support
	ruling it out of 
	serious print work but it can be a good semi-professional solution and
	for web work perfect and it's fun to
	use. <application>Gimp</application> also has a couple of 
	good drivers for Epson printers. <application>Ghostscript</application>
	has a problem with bitmaps &ndash; not all bitmaps but photographs, you
	could eventually get some good output but it will take some amount of
	tweaking. As far as text and vector graphics is concerned it's good
	enough to replace my Epson driver in Windows (it has a Windows
	version) <application>GhostScript</application> is available at its
	homepage <ulink url="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/"></ulink>
      </simpara>

      <simpara>Word processing is already covered. The problem areas are
	vector editing and page layout. <application>Framemaker</application>
	for Linux is a solution and <application>CorelDraw</application> is
	available but they are both commercial offerings. There are 
	vector editors but all are at a nascent stage. 
	<application>Sketch</application>,
	<application>Killustrator</application> and 
	<application>Impress</application> are coming along but far away from
	professional solutions like 
	<application>Draw</application> and 
	<application>Adobe Illustrator</application>. For page layout there is
	<application>Tex</application> but those used  
	to <application>Pagemaker</application>,
	<application>Quark</application> or <application>InDesign</application>
	are not going to be amused, its tough to
	learn and difficult to control and there are way too many issues with
	things like fonts and its not <acronym>wysiwyg</acronym> &ndash; we
	can't live without that.</simpara>

      <simpara>On a last note at the moment the only difference in
	productivity for me is in vector graphics, page layout and games. They
	are perhaps a year away at which point Linux would have over taken
	Windows &ndash; at least as far as I'm concerned &ndash; and I would
	have little reason to dual boot but I think having Windows is in a odd
	way comforting as is having Linux, perhaps I will always use them
	both.</simpara>
