<abstract>
<para>This document describes how to optimize and configure power management
on a ready-configured Linux system for use on battery-powered laptops. This
will be helpful for everyone who runs Linux on a portable computer system.
APM/ACPI methods of power management are discussed along with 
power saving tips and techniques.  There is also some discussion about the
different types of batteries available.</para>

<title>Power Management</title>
<para>If you have a relatively recent x86 laptop, odds are it supports either
Advanced Power Management (APM) or Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
(ACPI). ACPI is the newer of the two technologies and puts power management in
the hands of the operating system, allowing for more intelligent power
management than is possible with BIOS controlled APM. This is most useful for 
battery-powered laptops. 
You can only have one
power management interface in control of your machine at a time, so it's
important you decide which method best suits your situation.</para>

<sect2 id="apm">
<title>Advanced Power Management (APM)</title>
<para><emphasis>Advanced Power Management (APM)</emphasis>
allows your computer's BIOS to control your system's power management
without the knowledge of the operating system.
The advantages to APM under Linux are that it's stable, well supported by 
Linux vendors and has a solid history behind it. 
However, not much development has been done with it over the past few 
years.</para>

<para>To use it, you'll need to enable APM in the kernel:</para>

<screen>
      [*] Power Management support
      &lt;*&gt;   Advanced Power Management BIOS support
      [ ]     Ignore USER SUSPEND (NEW)
      [ ]     Enable PM at boot time (NEW)
      [ ]     Make CPU Idle calls when idle (NEW)
      [ ]     Enable console blanking using APM (NEW)
      [ ]     RTC stores time in GMT (NEW)
      [ ]     Allow interrupts during APM BIOS calls (NEW)
      [ ]     Use real mode APM BIOS call to power off (NEW)
</screen>



<para>
Most of the other APM
options exist as work-arounds for known problems with specific hardware 
devices,
so you'll probably only want to enable the first one (CONFIG_APM).</para>

<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Advanced Power Management BIOS support (CONFIG_APM):
			You'll need to enable this in order to do anything 
useful 
			with APM.  User-space programs will receive 
notification of
			APM events (e.g., battery status change) and a 
/proc/apm
			device will provide you with battery status 
information.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Ignore USER SUSPEND (CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND):
			This is a workaround for NEC Versa M 
notebooks.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Enable PM at boot time (CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE):
			Although it sounds nifty, most machines do
			not require this feature to be enabled and in fact can 
hang
			some systems at boot time.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Make CPU Idle calls when idle (CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE): 
On some machines,
			this option provides increased power savings.  On 
others, it will
			hang the system at boot time.  Use with 
caution.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Enable console blanking using APM 
(CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK):
			Instead of blanking the virtual console actually turn 
off the
			screen.  This won't work with X-Windows and actually 
can cause more
			problems that it solves.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>RTC stores time in GMT (CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT): If you 
want to
			store GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) in your RTC (Real Time 
Clock),
			say yes here.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Allow interrupts during APM BIOS calls 
(CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS):
			This is a workaround for some IBM Thinkpads that hang 
while
			suspending.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Use real mode APM BIOS call to power off 
(CONFIG_APM_REAL_MODE_POWER_OFF):
			This is a workaround for a number of broken BIOSes.  
If your computer
			crashes instead of powering off properly, turn this 
on.</para></listitem></itemizedlist>

<para>You'll want to install the APM daemon from
<ulink url="http://www.worldvisions.ca/~apenwarr/apmd/">http://www.worldvisions.ca/~apenwarr/apmd/</ulink> 
and configure your system startup scripts to activate it on boot:</para>

<screen>
# Start the APM daemon if it exists and if APM is enabled in the kernel
if [ -x /usr/sbin/apmd -a -d /proc/apm ]; then
	if cat /proc/apm 1> /dev/null 2> /dev/null ; then
		echo "Starting APM daemon:  /usr/sbin/apmd"
		/usr/sbin/apmd
	fi
fi
</screen>

<para>The APM daemon is actually made up of three primary programs:</para>

<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para><command>apmd</command> - handles power management 
tasks</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para><command>apm</command> - a command-line tool to print 
the current battery status or suspend the computer</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para><command>xapm</command> - a simple battery meter for 
X</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>If you're looking for a simple, "works out of the box" approach to power
management for your Laptop, APM is definitely the way to go.</para>

<para>A simple script to notify you how much battery time is remaining can be 
added to your <filename>~/.profile</filename> file:</para>

<screen>
if [ -f /proc/apm ]; then
        DUMMY=`cat /proc/apm | cut -d" " -f 7`
        # Don't display when fully charged
        if [ "$DUMMY" != "99%" ]; then
                LEVEL=`cat /proc/apm | sed -e "s/^.*% //"`
                echo "Battery at $DUMMY ($LEVEL)"
        fi
fi
</screen>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="acpi">
<title>Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)</title>
<para><emphasis>Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)</emphasis>
is the successor to APM, which places the responsibility of power management
away from the BIOS and into the hands of the operating system.
ACPI Linux is newer than APM Linux, more flexible in responding to power 
management events, has seen
much more development as of late, and as a result of all this is prone to its 
own share of bugs from
time to time.</para>

<para>If you're into cutting-edge development and are not intimidated with 
kernel
builds and applying patches against source code, ACPI is worth 
consideration.</para>

<para>There are two parts to ACPI under Linux:  The ACPI driver built into the
kernel itself, and the ACPI daemon (ACPID).  ACPID in its current incarnation 
is
pretty simple:  monitor /proc/acpi/event and do things in response.  Even if
you don't load the daemon, you'll still get the benefit of ACPI features built
into the kernel such as processor thermal support.</para>

<para>You can determine which version
of the ACPI driver you are using, along with supported suspend states, by 
using:</para>

<screen>
bash $ cat /proc/acpi/info
version: 20030619
states:  S0 S1 S3 S4 S4 S5
</screen>

<para>ACPI development is progressing at a steady rate, so you might want to 
consider 
<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=36832">patching</ulink> 
your kernel against any recent updates to the kernel-level ACPI code.  Once 
you have downloaded the
patch for your specific kernel, you can patch it with something like:</para>

<screen>
bash$ gunzip acpi-[version-kernel].diff.gz
bash# cd /usr/src/linux-[version]
bash# patch -Np1 -i ../acpi-[version-kernel].diff
</screen>

<para>You'll want to recompile your kernel after this, of course:</para>

<screen>
      [*] ACPI Support
      [ ] CPU Enumeration Only
      &lt;*&gt;   AC Adapter
      &lt;*&gt;   Battery
      &lt;*&gt;   Button
      &lt;*&gt;   Fan

      &lt; &gt;   ASUS Laptop Extras
      &lt; &gt;   Toshiba Laptop Extras
      [*]   Debug Statements
</screen>

<para>You'll also want to install the ACPID daemon from
<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=33140">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=33140</ulink>
and configure your system startup scripts to activate it on boot:</para>

<screen>
if [ -x /usr/sbin/acpid -a -d /proc/acpi ]; then
	echo "Starting ACPID Daemon:  /usr/sbin/acpid"
	/usr/sbin/acpid
fi
</screen>

<para>A bit of history... Microsoft was the first vendor to implement ACPI.  
This is both good and
bad.  It is good because when you buy a system, you can pretty much guarantee
that it has passed Microsoft's hardware compliance tests, including the test
of its ACPI implementation.  However, these tests come up short in that they
do not indicate compliance with the ACPI specification, but rather with
Microsoft's implementation of ACPI.  When that same machine is used with
Linux, some classes of errors that did not manifest themselves under Windows
may become apparent.  To protect against this problem, the Linux ACPI driver 
maintains a "bad BIOS" blacklist of known BIOS's that are known to not be ACPI
compliant, and as a result will refuse to enable ACPI if your system is 
listed.</para>

<para>Many manufacturers are now validating that their systems run on Linux.
However, they use major Linux distributions with the default kernel.  This
means that it is somewhat difficult to get OEMs to ensure that their systems
work with ACPI-enabled Linux until a major Linux distribution ships an ACPI
kernel.  This presents a slight dilemma in that Linux distributions want to
ship kernels that run on as many systems as possible, but there have been some
positive moves in this area lately.</para>

<para>To conserve energy while remaining quickly available, ACPI-compatible 
PCs may enter system sleep states. The ACPI specification defines five of 
these states, known as S-states. Unlike processor sleep states, no work is 
done by the system under S-states. Each state introduces greater power savings 
but requires commensurately more time to awaken and begin performing work. 
These are patterned on system states from the APM standard, a predecessor of 
ACPI.</para>

<para>Full details on ACPI sleep states are available at
<ulink url="http://acpi.sourceforge.net/documentation/sleep.html">http://acpi.sourceforge.net/documentation/sleep.html</ulink>.

<sect2 id="whichone">
<title>APM vs. ACPI: Which one?</title>
<para>There are currently two competing standards for providing power 
management: APM and ACPI.  Both cannot be used at the same time, so which one 
is best for your situation?  If you have a relatively recent (>2.4.20) kernel 
and are not intimidated by kernel builds and patching source code, you'll find 
many benefits with the flexibility of ACPI.  If you just want to enable 
generic power management, or are using an older machine, choose APM.  Neither 
method spins down idle hard drives; use hdparm for that instead.  Either way, 
your system's BIOS must correctly support the power management scheme you'd 
like to use as well; if your system does not fully support either standard, 
some of the power management options might crash your system and/or cause data 
loss.  You have been warned!</para>

<para>Even if you don't enable power management on your x86-laptop, Linux will 
always issue the HLT instruction to your 
processor whenever nothing needs to be done 

<footnote><para>source/arch/i386/kernel/process.c</para></footnote>.  

Many Microsoft Windows CPU cooling program use this technique.  This results 
in lowering the power consumption  of your CPU.  Note that the system doesn't 
power down when it receives the HLT instruction; it just stops executing 
instructions until there is an interrupt.</para>

<para>There is generally no advantage to
enabling either type of power management on servers or workstations that do 
not fall into
these categories.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="hyperthread">
<title>SMP, Hyper-Threading, IA64 &amp; NUMA</title>

<para>Some SMP system manufacturers may have omitted the pre-ACPI tables used 
for SMP configurations.  In this case, ACPI is required.</para>

<para>If you have a newer system that supports 
<ulink url="http://www.intel.com/technology/hyperthread/">Hyper-Threading</ulink>, 
you will need to enable ACPI (and, of course, SMP).  Without it, your Linux system 
may be unable to discover and initialize all of the virtual processors.</para>

<para>IA64 machines require ACPI as well.  Additionally, NUMA servers are 
starting to require it for proper initialization.</para>

<sect1 id="displaytypes">
<title>DPMS</title>

<para><command>DPMS</command> (Display Power Management Signaling) is a standard to
reduce power consumption in monitors. Typically, both the monitor and the video card 
must support the DPMS standard in order to receive any benefit from it.  DPMS specifies 
four modes of operation (in order of increasing power savings): "Normal", "Standby", 
"Suspend" and "Off".  Two signal lines, "Horizontal Sync" and "Vertical Sync" provide 
a method for signaling these four different states to a DPMS monitor.</para>  

<para>A good technical resource on DPMS is available at 
<ulink url="http://webpages.charter.net/dperr/dpms.htm">http://webpages.charter.net/dperr/dpms.htm</ulink>.
</para>

<sect2 id="normal">
<title>Normal</title>
<para><command>Normal</command> means just that -- the monitor is fully powered and on. 
LCD laptop panels and LCD flat screens use considerably less power than traditional CRT
monitors.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="standby">
<title>Standby</title>
<para><command>Standby</command> is used to describe a very minor power 
savings level. This setting usually involves
blanking the screen by turning off the electron (RGB) gun.  However, the
power supply is left on and the tube filaments energized.
When you need to use the monitor again, the monitor will come back on very 
quickly.
This option requires DPMS monitor and video card support along with enabling 
DPMS in XFree86.
Standby is sometimes referred to as <emphasis>hsync suspend mode</emphasis> 
since the horizontal sync signal
is turned off to signal this power management state to a DPMS monitor.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="suspend">
<title>Suspend</title>
<para><command>Suspend</command> is used to describe a very strong low power 
state.  This setting usually involves the same
power conservation as <command>Standby</command> however in addition the power 
supply to the monitor is turned off.
This option requires DPMS monitor and video card support along with enabling 
DPMS in XFree86.
Suspend is sometimes referred to as <emphasis>vsync suspend mode</emphasis> 
since the vertical sync signal
is turned off to signal this power management state to a DPMS monitor.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="off">
<title>Off</title>
<para><command>Off</command> usually means just that -- the computer monitor 
is turned off. Usually, a small
auxiliary circuit stays on to monitor the signals from the computer to turn
the monitor back on when data needs to be displayed to the screen.
Obviously, this keeps power consumption to a bare minimum (if not zero).
While the power saving is substantial, to reactivate the monitor may take 
several seconds.
This option requires DPMS monitor and video card support along with enabling 
DPMS in XFree86.
Both the horizontal and vertical sync signals are turned off to signal this 
power management state to a DPMS monitor.</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="methods">
<title>Power Management Methods</title>
<para>The basic goal of any power management technique is to reduce an 
entity's consumption.  In the case of laptop power management, our focus is on 
decreasing CPU and hard drive usage.  To make things a bit simpler, this is 
broken down into <emphasis>obvious, semi-obvious,</emphasis> and 
<emphasis>non-obvious</emphasis> techniques.  Granted, your mileage may 
vary.</para>

<sect2 id="swsusp">
<title>swsusp(8)</title>
<para>Suspend to Disk (S2D) is still an elusive task under Linux.  The main 
project at the moment is swsusp, available at 
<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/swsusp">http://sourceforge.net/projects/swsusp</ulink>.
It's still fairly new and requires a bit of configuration to enable it.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="hdparm">
<title>hdparm(8)</title>
<para><command>hdparm</command> is a Linux shell utility that can be used to 
spin down and improve the performance
of various ATA/IDE drives.  If it's not included with your system, you can 
fetch the source from
<ulink url="http://freshmeat.net/redir/hdparm/4062/url_homepage/hardware">http://freshmeat.net/redir/hdparm/4062/url_homepage/hardware</ulink>.
For example, the following provides 32-bit IO support with sync (-c3), DMA 
support (-d1), Advanced Power Management (-B128), write-caching
(-W1), disk spin down after five minutes (-S60).     gains me tremendous 
performance with added power savings.  Note that your mileage may vary, and 
you'll want to adjust this for your specific system to prevent data loss 
(especially the -B and -m flags!).</para>

<para>In the following example, we run some read/write benchmarks of our hard 
drive before and after using <command>hdparm</command>.
Note that while our cache reads remain about the same, our actual physical 
reads from the drive increase tremendously!
If you like living on the edge, you can play with the -m, -c, -B, and -u 
switches with caution (see the man page).</para>

<screen>
bash# hdparm -tT /dev/hda
Timing buffer-cache reads:   588 MB in  2.01 seconds = 292.15 MB/sec
Timing buffered disk reads:   14 MB in  3.46 seconds =   4.05 MB/sec

bash# hdparm -k1 -K1 -c3 -d1 -W1 /dev/hda
bash# hdparm -tT /dev/hda
Timing buffer-cache reads:   596 MB in  2.01 seconds = 297.01 MB/sec
Timing buffered disk reads:   72 MB in  3.05 seconds =  23.58 MB/sec

<sect2 id="sysklogd">
<title>sysklogd(8)</title>
<para>Examine your <command>/etc/syslog.conf</command> file for unnecessary 
logging activity
and to optimize its performance.  
If you don't want to log any system activity, consider disabling syslogd and 
klogd entirely or,
at the very least, minimize the amount of logging your system performs.
You can also prefix each entry with the minus sign (-) to omit syncing the 
file after each log entry 

<footnote><para>syslogd.c</para></footnote>.  

For example, this will log anything with a priority of 
<emphasis>info</emphasis> or higher, but lower than
<emphasis>warning</emphasis>, to <command>/var/log/messages</command> or 
<command>/var/log/mail</command>
without needing to sync to disk after each write.  Since we want to keep all 
messages with a priority of 
<emphasis>warning</emphasis>, this will be logged to a different file without 
disabling
disk syncing (to prevent data loss in the event of a system crash).</para>

<screen>
*.warning			/var/log/syslog
*.info;*.!warning;mail.none	-/var/log/messages
mail.info;mail.!warning		-/var/log/mail
</screen>

<para>Another item to be aware of is the <command>-- MARK --</command> 
messages that <command>syslogd(8)</command> writes.
This will affect your hard drive inactivity settings.  You can simply disable 
this by running <command>syslogd(8)</command> with:</para>

<para>
<screen>

	# '-m 0' disabled 'MARK' messages
	/usr/sbin/syslogd -m 0

</sect2>

<sect2 id="xf86">
<title>XFree86</title>
<para>There are essentially two different types of screen blanking that can be 
performed under XFree86:  BlankTime and DPMS.
The first is simply a fake "blanking" effect that doesn't actually save any 
power.  The others are specific only to
DPMS-compliant monitors, and must be specifically enabled to take effect.  
They are located in your <command>XF86Config</command>
file, which normally resides in <command>/etc/X11/XF86Config</command>.</para>


<para>If you have a DPMS-compliant monitor, you might want to try enabling 
support for it under the
<emphasis>Monitor</emphasis> section of your <command>XF86Config</command> 
file:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
Section "Monitor"
	Option	"DPMS"
EndSection
</screen>
</para>

<para>To manipulate the DPMS functions, you can create/modify the
following items in the <emphasis>ServerLayout</emphasis> section.</para>

<para>
<screen>
Section "ServerLayout"
	Option "BlankTime"	"10"	# Blank the screen in 10 minutes
	Option "StandbyTime" 	"20"	# Turn off screen in 20 minutes
	Option "SuspendTime"	"30"	# Full hibernation in 30 minutes
	Option "OffTime"	"40"	# Turn off DPMS monitor
EndSection
</screen>
</para>

<para>It's worth noting that <command>BlankTime</command> is not actually a 
power saving level at all.  The screen is sent 
a "fake" blanking effect and defaults to activate after 10 minutes.  
Alternately, it can indicate the number of
minutes until the screensaver should activate. It has nothing to do with 
DPMS.</para>

<para>After activating your changes and restarting X-Windows, you might want 
to examine your
logfile to see if your video card has any problems with your changes:</para>

<para>
<screen>
bash$ egrep "^\(WW|EE\)" /var/log/XFree86.0.log
</screen>
</para>

<para>There may be additional options that you can enable for your specific 
video card/chip driver; see the 
<ulink url="http://www.xfree86.org/support.html">XFree86 Documentation</ulink> 
website for specifics.</para>

<para>Of course, all of this can also be activated "on-the-fly" by using 
<command>xset(1)</command>.  
If you don't have access to your system's <command>XF86Config</command> file, 
a good place to put these commands would be in
your <command>~/.Xsession</command> or <command>~/.xinitrc</command> 
file.</para>

<para>
<screen>
bash$ xset -dpms			# Disable DPMS
bash$ xset +dpms			# Enable DPMS
bash$ xset s off			# Disable screen blanking
bash$ xset s 150			# Blank the screen after 150 seconds
bash$ xset dpms 300 600 900		# Set standby, suspend, & off times (in seconds)
bash$ xset dpms force standby		# Immediately go into standby mode
bash$ xset dpms force suspend		# Immediately go into suspend mode
bash$ xset dpms force off		# Immediately turn off the monitor
bash$ xset -q				# Query current settings
</screen>
</para>

<para>If instead you're using the Linux console (not X-Windows), you'll want 
to use <command>setterm(1)</command>:</para>

<para>
<screen>
bash$ setterm -blank 10			# Blank the screen in 10 minutes
bash$ setterm -powersave on		# Put the monitor into VESA power saving mode
bash$ setterm -powerdown 20		# Set the VESA powerdown to 20 minutes

<title>Swap File</title>
<para>Consider disabling your swap file in <command>/etc/fstab</command> to 
reduce hard drive access. 
If you've got lots of memory, this is definitely the way to go.  
One way to tell if you need your swap file is to enable it, use your system 
for a period of time,
and examine <command>/proc/meminfo</command> and <command>/proc/swaps</command>
to determine how much free memory you've got on average, and whether or not 
your swap file is even being utilized.</para>

<para>For example, today I've compiled several intensive programs and have 
been running my laptop for about eight hours straight.
A simple examination of my system reveals:</para>

bash$ cat /proc/swaps

<sect2 id="tmpfs">
<title>tmpfs</title>
<para>Compile your kernel with tmpfs (temporary file system) enabled and mount 
your /tmp directory using it.
The useful bit here is that nothing will be written to your hard drive on this 
mount point as it will act like
a RAM disk (however nothing will be saved either).  The advantage of tmpfs 
over the more traditional ramfs is
that it lives in the kernel internal cache and grows and shrinks to 
accommodate the files placed there.
See your kernel's Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt for full information.  
If you don't specify a maximum
size, it will default to a ceiling limit of half your available memory.  
An example /etc/fstab with 100MB temporary ram file mounted on /tmp would look 
like:

<screen>
tmpfs	/tmp	tmpfs	size=100m,mode=1777	0 0
</screen>

<para>
Modifying /proc/sys/vm/bdflush allows a user to specify under what 
circumstances dirty buffers are flushed to disk, how many such 
buffers exist, etc.  Details are in linux_src_tree/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt 
(thanks to Marc Liberatore for pointing this out).</para>

<para>Boot your system and list the currently loaded modules with lsmod.
Anything listed here most likely needs to be loaded on a regular basis;
compiling these in as part of your kernel rather than as loadable modules may
help to  decrease the amount of time they must be loaded from disk, and to a
very minor degree, decrease the amount of disk access required to start your 
system.</para>

<para>Examine your crontab settings to see if anything is being run on a
regular basis.  Comment out any unnecessary items.  Don't forget to examine
every user's crontab, including the user 'nobody'.  If you don't need to 
schedule
any background activity, consider disabling crond alltogether.  The same
advice goes for atd.</para>

<para>If you run httpd to test and/or develop web pages, try altering the
values of MinSpareServers and StartServers to 1.  Don't define any
CustomLogging or at least increase the value of LogLevel to warn.  If you're
really sure of yourself, you can change the ErrorLog directive to point to 
/dev/null.</para>

<para>Consider creating a power-saving script that will immediately take your 
laptop
into low-power mode:</para>

<para>
<screen>
#!/bin/sh
if [ -x /usr/sbin/hdparm ]; then
	hdparm -y /dev/hda
fi

if [ -x /usr/X11R6/bin/xset ]; then
	xset dpms force off

<sect2 id="myth">
<title>Power Saving Myths</title>

<para>It used to be beneficial to recompile the Linux PCMCIA drivers to allow 
the slots to have APM power support.  However, most of the functionality of 
these drivers are now built into the kernel itself.
If you're interested in specifics, the PCMCIA project page is available at 
<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcmcia-cs/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcmcia-cs/</ulink>.
</para>

<para>Some people believe that APM offers better power savings over ACPI, and 
vice-versa.  While their power management
techniques differ, in actual battery-usage tests, both reportedly perform 
about the same.</para>

<para>Contrary to popular belief, Lithium Ion (see below) batteries
<emphasis>do</emphasis> suffer from a memory effect.
Luckily, the effect is not large over the lifespan of a typical battery (3-4 
years).  Anyone who tells you different
is selling something.</para>

</sect2>
</sect1>


<sect1 id="battery">
<title>Types of Batteries</title>
<para>There are currently three types of batteries commonly used for
laptops:  Nickel Cadmium, Nickel Metal Hydride, and Lithium Ion.</para>

<sect2 id="nicd">
<title>Nickel Cadmium (Ni-Cd)</title>
<para>Nickel Cadmium (Ni-Cd) batteries were the standard technology for years,
but today they are out of date and new laptops don't use them anymore. They
are heavy and very prone to the "memory effect". When recharging a NiCd
battery that has not been fully discharged, it "remembers" the old charge and
continues there the next time you use it.  The memory effect is caused by
crystallization of the battery's substances and can permanently reduce your
battery's lifetime, even make it useless. To avoid it, you should completely
discharge the battery and then fully recharge it again at least once every few
weeks.  As this battery contains cadmium, a toxic material, it should always
be recycled or disposed of properly.</para>

<para>NiCad batteries, and to a some degree NiMH batteries, suffer from what's
called the <emphasis>memory effect</emphasis>. Memory Effect means that if a 
battery is
repeatedly only partially discharged before recharging, the battery will
forget that it can further discharge. The best way to prevent this situation
is to fully charge and discharge your battery on a regular basis.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="nimh">
<title>Nickel Metal Hydride (Ni-MH)</title>
<para>Nickel Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) batteries are the cadmium-free replacement
for NiCad. They are less affected by the memory effect than NiCd and thus
require less maintenance and conditioning.  However, they have problems at
very high or low room temperatures. And even though they use less hazardous
materials (i.e., they do not contain heavy metals), they cannot be fully
recycled yet.  Another main difference between NiCad and NiMH is that NiMH
battery offers higher energy density than NiCads. In other words, the capacity
of a NiMH is approximately twice the capacity of its NiCad counterpart. What
this means for you is increased run-time from the battery with no additional
bulk or weight.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="liion">
<title>Lithium Ion (Li-ion)</title>
<para> Lithium Ion (Li-ion) are the new standard for portable power.  Li-ion
batteries produce the same energy as NiMH but weighs approximately 20%-35%
less.  They do not suffer significantly from the memory effect unlike their NiMH and Ni-Cd
counterparts. Their substances are non-hazardous to the 0.  Because
lithium ignites very easily, they require special handling. Unfortunately,
few consumer recycling programs have been established for Li-ion batteries at
this point in time.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="smart">
<title>Smart Batteries</title>
<para><emphasis>Smart</emphasis> batteries are not really a different type of
battery, but they do deserve special mention.  Smart batteries have internal
circuit boards with chips which allow them to communicate with the
laptop and monitor battery performance, output voltage and temperature.
Smart batteries will generally run 15% longer due to their increased
efficiency and also give the computer much more accurate "fuel gauge"
capabilities to determine how much battery run time is left before the next
recharge is required.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="batcomp">
<title>General Battery Care</title> 
<para>Even if the battery case looks the same, you cannot just upgrade to
another battery technology unless your laptop has been pre-configured from the
manufacturer to accept more than one type of battery type, since the recharging
process is different for each of the three types of batteries.</para>
 
<para>A battery that is not used for a long time will slowly discharge itself.
Even with the best of care, a battery needs to be replaced after 500 to 1000
recharges. But still it is not recommended to run a laptop without the battery
while on ac power -- the battery often serves as a big capacitor to protect
against voltage peaks from your ac outlet.</para>

<para>As the manufacturers change the shapes of their batteries every few
months, you might have problems to find a new battery for your laptop in a few
years from now. This is somewhat of a concern only if you anticipate using the
same laptop several years from now.  If in doubt, buy a spare battery now - 
before it's out of stock.</para>

<para>New batteries come in a discharged condition and must be fully charged
before use. It is recommended that you fully charge and discharge the new
battery two to four times to allow it to reach its maximum rated capacity.  It
is generally recommend that you perform an overnight charge (approximately
twelve hours) for this. Note: It is normal for a battery to become warm to the 
touch during charging and
discharging.  When charging the battery for the first time, the device may
indicate that charging is complete after just 10 or 15 minutes. This is a
normal with rechargeable batteries. New batteries are hard for the device to
charge; they have never been fully charged and are not broken in. Sometimes the
device's charger will stop charging a new battery before it is fully charged.
If this happens, remove the battery from the device and then reinsert it. The
charge cycle should begin again. This may happen several times during the
first battery charge. Don't worry; it's perfectly normal.  Keep the battery 
healthy by fully
charging and then fully discharging it at least once every two to three weeks.
Exceptions to the rule are Li-Ion batteries which do not suffer from the
memory effect.</para>

<para>Batteries should be stored in a discharged state since they
can self-discharge and may become inactive after a long storage period. They
should not be stored for any length of time while connected to the laptop.
High humidity and temperatures can cause the battery to deteriorate, so these
should be avoided during storage.</para>

<para>Do not remove and carry a battery pack in your pocket, purse, or other
container where metal objects (such as car keys or paper clips) could 
short-circuit the
battery terminals. The resulting excessive current flow can cause extremely
high temperatures and may result in damage to the battery pack or cause fire
or burns.</para>
