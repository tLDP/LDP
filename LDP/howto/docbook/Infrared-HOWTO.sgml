The Infrared-HOWTO (former IR-HOWTO) provides an introduction to Linux and infrared devices and how to use the software provided by the Linux/IrDA project. This package uses IrDA(TM) compliant standards. IrDA(TM) is an industrial standard for infrared wireless communication, and most laptops made after January 1996 are equipped with an IrDA(TM) compliant infrared transceiver. Infrared ports let you communicate with printers, modems, fax machines, LANs, and other laptops. Speed ranges from 2400bps to 4Mbps. The Linux/IrDA stack supports IrLAP, IrLMP, IrIAS, IrIAP, IrLPT, IrCOMM, IrOBEX, and IrLAN. Several of the protocols are implemented as both clients and servers. There is also support for multiple IrLAP connections, via several IrDA(TM) devices at once. The Linux/IrDA project started at the end of 1997 and its status is still experimental, so please don't expect every feature working straight. AFAIK Linux/IrDA is the _only_ open source IrDA implementation currently available. Remote Control (RC) via infrared is not the aim of the project, though partly treated in this HOWTO.

<TITLE>Status of the Document</TITLE>

<PARA>
I hadn't time to follow all the recent developments in Linux/IrDA. Therefore this document still needs a major rewrite, which I intend to do, when the Linux/IrDA source is included into the upcomming stable 2.4.x kernel. So you have to expect that some things described below don't work anymore or in another way. I hope this document may point you in the right direction though.

<TITLE>Project History</TITLE>

<PARA>
The project started at the end of 1997 with the name Linux/IrDA. Due to some troubles with the name IrDA, which is trademarked by the <ULink
URL="http://www.irda.org/"
>Infrared Data Association IrDA</ULink
>, the name was changed to Linux/IR. At the end of 1998 the the relationship between both became better and the name was changed to Linux/IrDA again. Since February 1999 the project is an official member of <ULink

The Linux/IrDA project has undertaken some changes in the program code, which you should know to understand some confusions.
</PARA>

<PARA>
For 2.0.x kernels Linux/IrDA support worked in a totally other way and is no longer supported by the Linux/IrDA project. Since 2.1.131 and 2.2.0  is part of the kernel. Please note that the status of the project just changed from experimental to stable with 2.2.10 kernels.

Currently there are two graphical user interfaces for Linux/IrDA under development one for KDE and one for GNOME. See GUI chapter below. For the GNOME application you will need the Perl-GTK+ module and Python. You must also install all the development packages. To run Linux/IrDA I recommend to check the command line tools first, because the GUIs don't seem to be finished yet.

IrDA(TM) is an industrial standard for infrared wireless communication. Infrared ports let you communicate with printers, modems, fax machines, LANs, and laptops. Speed ranges from 2400bps to 4Mbps. To use this features you need the irda_utils provided by the Linux/IrDA project http://irda.sourceforge.net . Further information you may find there and in the Linux-Infrared-HOWTO at http://mobilix.org/howtos.html . Currently it is recommended to build IrDA support as modules only. Please see Documentation/modules.txt. Please note the status of Linux/IrDA is still experimental.

In the normal life of the IrLAP protocol, it sends a lot of
small RR (Receive Ready) frames over the link (at least when it
has nothing else to do). Saying Y to this option will make IrLAP
recycle these frames thus avoiding many alloc_skb's and

Linux's own serial driver for all IrDA ports that are 16550
compatible. Most IrDA chips are 16550 compatible so you should
probably say Y to this option. Using IrTTY will however limit

Dag Brattli: " The problem is that I'm including kernel header files which conflicts with the libc header files. So why do I need to include kernel header files? Well, the libc/glibc header files does not know that much about IrDA (yet). The reason is just that IrDA is quite new. I could have just defined the stuff in the program itself, but then people would be able to compile the stuff even if the definitions had changed in the kernel. I think its better that you get a compile error than some possible strange behaviour. If you don't want to wait until I figure out how to solve this stuff, you can just remove the linux header files and define the constants in your program yourself:
</PARA>

<PARA>

#define PF_IRDA          23

All the stuff above should not be changed, so it is probably safe to just hardcode them.

The <command>irmanager</command> is user-space daemon that is inspired and quite similar to the <command>cardmgr</command> used in the PCMCIA distribution. For example, if IrLMP discovers a remote device with IrLAN provider capabilities and no local IrLAN client has registered, then IrLMP will send an event to the IrManager and make it <command>modprobe</command> the module required. When application level clients are ready for communication and user-space configuration, they can also notify IrManager about this, so that it can execute the right script. For example will IrLAN send the event <command>EVENT_IRLAN_START</command> when the data channel is ready for exchanging Ethernet frames. When IrManager receives this event, it will execute <command>/etc/irda/network start &lt;devname&gt;</command> to configure the network interface. If you use the RedHat variant of it, it will in turn execute <command>/sbin/ifup&lt;devname&gt;</command> .

<TITLE>irdadump</TITLE>

<PARA>
One advantage of implementing IrDA device drivers as network device drivers is that you should be able to attach sniffers to the device (or actually the packet type). That way, it is possible to use a really handy utility called <command>irdadump</command> (instead of <command>tcpdump</command>). This will make debugging MUCH easier. Linux-2.2 implements the BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter), so its possible to filter out exactly the frames you want to see. 
</PARA>

<PARA>
Note: You probably have to be <Emphasis remap="it">root</Emphasis> for using <command>irdadump</command> . <command>CONFIG_PACKET</command> has to be enabled in the kernel. If compiled as a module you might load the module manually. <command>irdadump</command> has been converted into a library, so it can be used from GUI applications as well.

The <Emphasis remap="it">IrManager</Emphasis> will receive events from the kernel level side of the protocol stack.

For example, if IrLMP discovers a remote device with IrLAN provider capabilities and no local IrLAN client has registered, then IrLMP will send an event to the IrManager and make it "modprobe" the module required. [..]

When application level clients are ready for communication and user-space configuration, they can also notify IrManager about this, so that it can execute the right script.

This network script is actually the same as used by the PCMCIA code and since I'm using the Redhat variant of it, it will in turn execute <command>/sbin/ifup &lt;devname&gt;</command>.
</PARA>

<PARA>
So by using the IrManager, I "only" have to do this when I start the stack:

<ProgramListing>
irattach /dev/ttyS2 &#38;
irmanager -d 1           # -d 1 means: start discovery process
</ProgramListing>

and then when my laptop discovers the IrLAN provider (HP Netbeamer in my case) it will ask <Emphasis remap="it">IrManager</Emphasis> to load the module <command>irlan_client</command>. When the connection is up and ready, it will ask it to execute <filename>/etc/irda/network start eth0</filename>. When the connection is broken, it will again ask it to take down the interface using <command>/etc/irda/network stop eth0</command>.[..]
</PARA>

<PARA>
That's all to get it working if you are using Redhat. If you are using some other distribution which doesn't have <filename>/sbin/ifup</filename>, then you better copy <filename>/etc/pcmcia/network.opts</filename> to <filename>/etc/irda/network.opts</filename> or configure the file yourself.
</PARA>

<PARA>
If you want to use the IrLAN server, you will still have to <command>modprobe irlan_server</command> before you start the <command>irmanager</command> _without_ <command>-d 1</command>.
</PARA>

<PARA>
And just like the <command>cardmgr</command>, you will (if you want to) get the beeps when the connection is up and running and when it is disconnected!!!
</PARA>

<PARA>
I hope that we can add such scripts for all the other clients/services that need user level configuration. It would be really cool to have a <filename>/etc/irda/printer</filename> script for configuring IrDA(TM) capable printers. So if you get in range of an IrDA(TM) capable printer, then IrManager should load the <command>irlpt_client</command> module, and also configure the other stuff that needs to be done for using this printer.
</PARA>

<PARA>
I also hope that we can use the <command>config</command> file for configuring IrDA(TM) ports and device drivers. Something like:

<ProgramListing>
Device Drivers
  module "irtty" script="irattach /dev/ttyS2"
  module "smc_ircc" irq=11 port=0x34f
</ProgramListing>

So that IrManager can load and start all these when it is executed. In this way we would only have to start IrManager in <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d/irda</filename> and the rest would be plug and play. There would be no need for manually starting programs and configuring devices.
When <command>irmanager</command> receives the following events for a device &lt;dev&gt; it will currently do:
</PARA>

<PARA>
EVENT_IRLAN_START, start and configure the device using <command>/sbin/ifup &lt;dev&gt;</command>

If this is not the case, you either don't have infrared support enabled in the BIOS or the SIR mode of your infrared device is not detected by the kernel. Currently I know only two laptop models with this effect, the HP OmniBook 800 and the Toshiba Libretto models. I am not sure whether PnP support effects the detection of the IR port. If you are unsure try it out and let me know the results. Maybe you can use FIR mode if SIR doesn't work.

dongle.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Dag Brattli wrote (modified by wh): "To use dongles you have to do something like this:

<ProgramListing>
modprobe tekram         # or esi or actisys
irmanager -d 1          # 
irattach -d tekram      # or -d esi or -d actisys
</ProgramListing>

As you can see, you must still use the <command>-d</command> option with <command>irattach</command> since it is possible to have two serial ports using different dongles at the same time (so the tty you are binding must know which dongle it is supposed to use). So if you have two dongles and two serial ports, you could do something like this:

<ProgramListing>
modprobe tekram
modprobe esi
irattach /dev/ttyS0 -d esi &#38;
irattach /dev/ttyS1 -d tekram &#38;
</ProgramListing>

PS: I would not try to turn the two dongles against each other, since I really don't know how the stack would react :-) 
...
Since I don't have any of these new ACTiSYS 220L+ dongles, I'm not able to test it. Since the new dongle has support for one extra speed (38400bps), you must specify the dongles differently with <command>irattach</command> so that the kernel knows which dongle you are using (and what QoS can be used):

<ProgramListing>
irattach /dev/ttyS0 -d actisys     # for the 220L dongle 
irattach /dev/ttyS0 -d actisys+    # for the 220L+ dongle
</ProgramListing>

The current implementation of dongle support does not have any state associated with it, so its not possible to use both ACTiSYS dongles (220L and 220L+) at the same time (connected to two serial ports) for now. If someone needs to be able to do so, please mail me (Dag Brattli) and I will think about it!"

Dag Brattli: "It is now possible to use <command>irport</command> instead of <command>irtty</command>! I have moved all the dongle stuff out of <command>irtty</command> and into <command>irda_device</command>, so it will also be possible to attach dongles to <command>irport</command>. Need however to make a small user-space utility <command>dongle_attach</command> that can be used to attach dongles to a specific driver instance. BTW. <command>irattach</command> is still working as before, and you will not notice the difference even when attaching dongles to <command>irtty</command> (I've just redirected the dongle ioctl to irda_device). Irport may be interesting since you avoid one software interrupt (bh) level, and it's also forced to work in half duplex mode so you don't get any echo if the irda port itself don't have echo-cancellation (girbil dongle and HP-4000 etc) ... To use it, you must supply the parameters to <command>insmod</command> like this: <command>insmod irport io=0x3f8 irq=4</command>, or whichever values you use. You can also add these parameters to <filename>/etc/conf.modules</filename> like this: <command>options irport io=0x3f8 irq=4</command>, but then you must remember to do a <command>depmod -a</command> and use <command>modprobe irport</command> instead of <command>insmod</command>."

From James &lt;james@esc.cam.ac.uk&gt; I have this description about setting up the hardware: There are two configurations, a five pin in line connector and a 6 pin DIL (at the end of a 18 pin DIL header). Basically any IrDA conpatible transceiver will work (I have a stack of old IRM3001 these are now obselete) you need to hook a capacitor (use a tantalum about ~1uF) between 5V and 0V near the transceiver and then connect everthing else up (RX-&gt;RX, TX-&gt;TX, 5V-&gt;5V, and 0V-0V). If you don't like soldering irons, lots of companies do sell IR modules for the 5 pin connectors that fit into a hole in your case.

</OrderedList>

Up to 115.200bps (SIR) many (probably all) infrared controllers work like a serial port and use a RZI (return to zero, inverted) modulation. Not every infrared controller supports 4Mps (FIR), up to 4Mbps they have to use 4PPM (4 pulse position) modulation technique. Currently there are two FIR chips supported: NationalSemiConductor NSC PC87108 e.g. used in IBM Thinkpad 560X and Winbond W83977AF (IR) FIR chip e.g. used in the Corel Netwinder PC. You may start the FIR service by loading the according module. Linux/IrDA will probe your hardware then. More drivers are under development.
</PARA>

<PARA>
So what speeds can you expect? Using SIR, you should be able to get about 10 Kbytes/s. Using FIR (4Mbps) you can get over 300 Kbytes/s (if you are lucky).

Why this? Unfortunately Linux users are not always supported with the necessary hardware information. Sometimes it is possible to look at this informations in Window$95. Sometimes its even useful to connect the two. Linux could also provide occasional access point services to a Window95 laptop of a friend dropping by.

Where to get it from? At http://www.microsoft.com in the directory /Windows95/downloads/contents/WURecommended/S_WUCommunications/W95IrDA/ you will find a support pack <Emphasis remap="it">Infrared Transfer 2.0</Emphasis>. It is a self-extracting archive <command>W95IR.EXE</command> with 331KB. Note: Microsoft seems to change the location of this file (and others) at random, the former URL is <ULink

<PARA>
Version 1.0 is still delivered with some hardware.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Version 2.0 is the version they currently offer at their web site. It is in the self-extracting file W95IR.EXE. The last time I looked (1999-02-21) it was 434KB and was found at http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/W95IR.EXE . Their website is frequently changing, so do not be surprised to find the file (also) in another location or not at all. 
</PARA>

<PARA>
Version 3.0 can/could be found in their downloadable Infrared development kit IRDDK30, but is mostly useful for developers. It is internally different from 2.0, it is based on "miniport" network drivers, just like the Linux version. It exists for some time and has some support for NT, but it clearly did not make it into the mainstream NT4.0 distributions. For 95 you are probably better off with 2.0. The choice may depend on the documentation of the drivers you get with your specific hardware.

MS website also used to contain a nice utility <command>IrXfer</command>, contained in the archive <command>IRXFER.EXE</command>, This is the <Emphasis remap="it">Infrared Transfer</Emphasis> utility, which uses an IrOBEX variant I think, it is referenced in the IrOBEX protocol description.

<PARA>
I suppose there are <Emphasis remap="it">four</Emphasis> ways to connect Linux/IrDA and Window$95:
</PARA>

<PARA>
1) A <Emphasis remap="it">network connection</Emphasis> between two PC's. If you have set up <Emphasis remap="it">Infrared Transfer 2.0</Emphasis>, you will find an IrDA(TM) network device in the &lt;<Emphasis remap="it">Network Device Section</Emphasis>&gt;. But I couldn't get a working connection yet.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Some information by Fons Botman: MS does not support PEER mode, which is strange, because it would fit their <Emphasis remap="it">workgroup</Emphasis> model. I have had success with IrLAN DIRECT mode when I removed the <command>COMPUTER</command> entry in the hints bits from the Linux side. Windows95 will recognise the Linux box as a lan access point and will try to install a driver for it but cannot find it. At this point I install the <Emphasis remap="it">network adapter</Emphasis> driver named <Emphasis remap="it">Microsoft IrDA Lan Driver</Emphasis> (you can also do this beforehand). You now should have a new active network driver which can be seen with <command>WINIPCFG</command>. To make it work with TCPIP I give the linux side an address using the redhat configuration tools and start a dhcp server on the linux box which hands out leases on the IrDA subnet. Sometimes I have to use <command>WINIPCFG</command> to explicitly ask for a lease. After this you can freely network between the two computers. Try to telnet or use explorer from Windows95 to linux.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Open points:
</PARA>

<PARA>
a. write a proper <filename>/etc/sysconfig/network/irlan-up</filename> script.
</PARA>

<PARA>
b. solve the direct/peer mode problem and the peer mode dhcp problem (zero, one, too many dhcp servers on the irda sublan), maybe borrow leases from a dhcpserver on the eth0 lan (dhcrelay).
</PARA>

<PARA>
c. Make the <Emphasis remap="it">Microsoft IrDA Lan Driver</Emphasis> install automatically, maybe this is a problem in the PnP configuration. This seemed to work better on Windows98.
</PARA>

<PARA>
d. I sometimes get a TCP configuration problem after disconnect, which can be solved by a Windows95 reboot. Maybe tune the dhcp configuration.
</PARA>

<PARA>
2) Maybe it is also possible to use the <Emphasis remap="it">IrOBEX protocol</Emphasis>. But I don't know which software to use and where to get it. I supposed the necessary software comes with a Palm III, but this seems not to be true.

4) From Fons Botman: IrLPT works fine. Make Linux the IrLPT server, and in Windows95 configure a printer to use the virtual LPT port defined when you installed MS-IrDA. Windows95 periodically sends some short sequence to the printer, I still have to figure out what that is.

Configure a network connection for your WinCE device. Go into "Connections" and create a "Direct Connection" Name it something meaningful, for device select "Infrared Port". Go into settings and change the baud rate to 115200, this is the max for WinCE. Go to
TCP/IP settings and check "Use server-assigned IP address," and "Use software compression," and "Use IP header compression" Make sure "Use Slip," is unchecked. For Name Servers, make sure "Use server-assigned addresses" is checked.  Go to Start, Settings, Communications, Identification and enter something for the Device Name.

Please note this feature is still quite experimental! Dag Brattli wrote: "Just wanted you to know I have just added COMPRESSION support to IrLAP! As you may know, this is _not_ part of the IrDA(TM) standard, but Linux can now negotiate with its peer and check if it has the same compression capabilities). So obviously if you are talking to Win95, Palm III or whatever, you will _not_ get compression!!! This is something which is exclusive for Linux as far as I know! The IrDA(TM) standard says that devices should ignore unknown field in the negotiation header, so we are still "compatible" with IrDA(TM) (have just borrowed an unused header value).

The compression interface is similar to PPP, so you can add as many different compressors as you want. Currently there is only support for GZIP, but BSD compression will be added later.
...
Have just tested GZIP compression at 4Mbps. It was a really bad idea! Compressing the frames takes so much time that the performance is actually worse than when not using compression at all. The conclusion is that compression should only be used for SIR speeds, ..."

Just fire up <command>gpm -t ps2 /dev/irkbd</command> and the laptop will make a keyboard/mouse connection to the IR-660.

... one problem: <command>gpm</command> can handle <Emphasis remap="it">multiple mice</Emphasis>, but Linux cannot handle <Emphasis remap="it">multiple different keyboards</Emphasis>. So if you have one norwegian keyboard and one <Emphasis remap="it">remote</Emphasis> US keyboard like I have, then things will be a little bit confusing. I got a hint from Alan Cox about a project that is implementing <Emphasis remap="it">real</Emphasis> support for multiple keyboards, so I'll check that out.
</PARA>

<PARA>
... OK, I sort of worked it out. By using TIOCSTI on <filename>/dev/console</filename>, you can insert scancodes directly into the tty queue. This can be a problem for virtual consoles that expect to receive some translated and cooked keycodes, but X happens to like raw scancodes, so this will work quite nice when using X but not for other virtual consoles. Anyway this is good enough for me, so I will not use a lot of time converting the scancodes to keycodes and index them with some keymap just to make it work with text only virtual consoles. As I see it the irkbd driver has now been successfully been ported to user-space :-)

<PARA>
... the Tekram IR-660 device can, in addition to attach a keyboard and mouse, also print using IrTTP (it can print using IrLPT, but that is not so funny since it requires exclusive use of IrLMP, and you don't wan't to stop the network, mouse and keyboard just to print a document). I'll try and see if I can get IrTTP printing working using a fifo as well.

... Tekram has added a control channel in addition to the data channel so that you can get some status information about what is going on. The name of their own protocol is P1248. It's published through the "P1248" class and "IrDA:TinyTP:LsapSel" LM-IAS entry, so you can try to find it.

... Canon is using the P1248 protocol, and their printer monitor program BrintBuddy2 (Japanese version) is using this protocol now. I don't know what they use for the data channel.

It is possible to implement both IrDA-D and IrDA-C in the same device. Sharp says that IrDA-D and IrDA-C can coexist -- as long as both of them are not used at the same time in the same IR space. This sounds rather funny to me. According to this definition, anything can co-exist with anything as long as you do not destroy the universe permanently in the process ;-) 
</PARA>

<PARA>
Seriously, what SHARP says is that they can tailor the IrDA-D so that there are some unused time between the negotiated maximum turnaround time and the actual transmission. They then squeeze the IrDA-C frames in those unused time. The IrDA-D Primary and IrDA-C Master must be implemented in the same device. The keyboards will work, but mice and joysticks may be sluggish at times."

<TITLE>How to Make Inrared Light Visible</TITLE>

<PARA>
If you have a IRDA aware printer, you can point you phone at it and you should see a light near the IR port light up or flash. If you have a Palm organizer w/ IR, point it at the phone. If the IR on the phone is in discovery mode, you should see the "Waiting for Sender" dialog box pop up on the Palm.
</PARA>
<PARA>
There is a program for the Palm called "IRMonitor" which measures IR emissions. You can get this off EuroCool or PilotZone. You run the program, point your Palm at where you think the IR beam should be coming from and if there are any emissions from that port, they will  show up as a spike on the IrMonitor scrolling graph. I would highly recommend this program to anybody out there who plays with or works with IR devices.

You may also use a video camera to detect infrared light. But I couldn't check this yet.

Annotations about CORBA by Dag Brattli: I have just had the first successful test running ORBit/CORBA over IrDA sockets/IrTTP! ORBit is btw. the GNU CORBA implementation used by the GNOME project.

Applications on the laptop can then make use of CORBA exported services on your stationary machine.

I use my laptop and a NetWinder for testing. The machines are connected by both Ethernet and IrDA.

If somethings goes wrong, IIOP (TCP/IP) will automagically be used instead. When the transaction if finished, the link goes down again."

The two ways to do this are to increase transmitted light intensity, or to increase receiver sensitivity. In order to extend the link distance, both sensitivity and intensity must be increased for both ends of the IR link. If it is desired to communicate with a standard IrDA device that may have minimum transmitter intensity, the receiver intensity must be increased. The standard IrDA device may also have minimum receiver sensitivity, so transmitter intensity must also be increased."

&lt;tzeruch@ceddec.com&gt;: The main problem is that you generally have to make the receiver more sensitive. Basic physics has the inverse square law: the intensity drops with the SQUARE of the distance, so going from 1 to 5 meters requires 25x the power (and battery drain on a portable device), or 25x the sensitivity (and dynamic range - it still has to be able to work at 3 inches).  And if you want to do it on the other end, it doesn't simply have to be 25x more sensitive, it must pick up the tiny IrDA pulse needle in a haystack of florescent lights, screen savers, moving shadows ...

Also laser diodes (pulsable) were recommended by K-H.Eischer: But they are more expensive. And the laser diodes are also dangerous if they have more than 1 mW. A better solution would be to use lenses to focus the beam. There is a minimum of absorbtion in the air (I don't know the right frequency) and you should use IR diodes with this frequency.

Linux/IrDA may get problems if you are running the esound server (<command>esd</command>) on your machine. Both my machines, a 166Mhz Pentium laptop and a 200Mhz Pentium Pro cannot run Linux/IrDA when esd is running. The reason is that esd makes the soundcard give interrups over 300 times/second which makes the serial driver overrun when receiving. This is because the serial driver now uses slow interrupts in Linux-2.2 (everything is slow interrupts in 2.2), so the interrupt-handler schedules on its way out. The good thing about slow interrupts is that packets are delivered much faster, since you don't need to wait for the next timer-tick. The only exception for this is the pc87108 driver which works fine since it uses DMA and will only give a couple of interrupts per packet.

1) First part is executed as <command>irdaipcfg ifeth ifirlan</command> daemonizes, then looks for ARP packets on ifirlan, checks that the arp was not generated by the machine on which it is running. The arp contains the ip address of the machine on the other end of the irlan (it was generated by the gratuatous arp in the irlan code). The program then sets up a host route to this ip address via ifirlan, adds a proxy arp to ifeth for it and generates a gratuatous arp on ifeth. It writes the ip address of the client in <filename>/var/run/host.ifirlan</filename> so you can easily undo all of this from a script.

If I just kill irattach and remove irtty and serial, and start irattach again, it starts working again. Does this occur with other linux laptops also? Is it a problem in the serial device driver?

Answer by Dag Brattli: "Could you all check if the same thing is happening when your're using PPP (and not using IrDA). I guess the APM stuff shuts down the serial port, so that the driver will need to reinitialize it when waking up again. This is properly implemented by some of the PCMCIA drivers I know about, but I really don't think the serial driver gets any events from the APM system.
</PARA>

<PARA>
So here you have your own little kernel project. Start adding APM support to irport which will be the easiest thing (and also to the FIR drivers), then you can start adding a patch to the serial driver (if needed). Again I think the PCMCIA subsystem may be a good source on how to fix it properly."

<Emphasis remap="it">AIR</Emphasis> is pushed mainly by IBM. You get wider angle and longer distance (10M?) but may be at lower data rate. You can also time-multiplex this already slow channel.

Q1 - Question: I do not know anything about ports and irqs. What should I do? 
</PARA>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<PARA>
Answer: 


<PARA>
PART A: Hardware settings
</PARA>

<PARA>
- 1  Have a look at your hardware specs!!! If not available look at the support page of your vendor, or contact the support hotline. You might also find the information in one of the hardware surveys mentioned above.
</PARA>

<PARA>
- 2  Use a current BIOS. Usually available at the support page of your vendor.
</PARA>

<PARA>
- 3  Try <command>setserial /dev/ttyS? -g -a | egrep 16550A</command>. One of the shown devices is probably the one you are looking for. Usually it is the second one, but with no guarantee.
</PARA>

<PARA>
- 4  Note: What seems like an UART is physically the IrDA controller. For my HP Omnibook 800 this is the VLSI VL82C147 PCI - IrDA controller. These controllers should behave up to 115 200 bps like UART's. But sometimes it is very difficult to get the right configuration.
</PARA>

<PARA>
PART B: How to tell the kernel about the hardware settings
</PARA>

<PARA>
-4  <command>cat /proc/ioports</command> to see which ports are already in use.
</PARA>

<PARA>
-5  <command>cat /proc/interrupts</command> to see which interrupts are already in use.
</PARA>

<PARA>
-6  Make ports and interrupts available for use with the IR device, e.g. stop the pcmcia service or include a line like this in <filename>/etc/sysconfig/pcmcia</filename>: <command>PCIC_OPTS="irq_list=3,4,5,7,9,10,12,14,15"</command>
</PARA>

<PARA>
-7  Now try to guess what the right interrupt and port is. Use <command>setserial /dev/ttySx irq M port 0xNNNN</command> to tell the kernel. If there is more then one possible chance try them all (Note: As mentioned in the <Emphasis remap="it">Serial-HOWTO</Emphasis> you should not try irq 0, 1, 6, 8, 13, 14).
</PARA>

<PARA>
-8  If you were successful please send these parameters to the author, because I would like to include them in the <ULink

It might also be necessary to fine tune the IR serial port with setserial, e.g., <command>setserial /dev/ttyS0 spd_vhi</command> (speed rate 115200).

 Q2 - Question: For me, <command>irattach</command> hangs, but recognizes the printer. <filename>/var/log/messages</filename> shows that irattach found my HP LaserJet 6P.
</PARA>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<PARA>
Answer: The "hang" is normal for irattach. Everything is working right if you see the HP Laserjet show up in the log. "hang" means irattach is polling the IrDA-Devices for incoming connections. If you kill it with &lt;CTRL C&gt; the irattach program crashes and /dev/ttySx does not work anymore. The problem is within the irda module, and not with the irattach program. Rebooting is the only thing to do! Next time put irattach in the background by using <command>irattach &amp;</command>. Stop it if necessary with <command>killall irattach</command>. Recommendation by Andreas Butz: To my knowledge, &lt;CTRL Z&gt; <command>bg</command> should work, too, but I haven't tried it in this specific case. Normally it has the exact same effect as appending <command>&amp;</command> to a command.

<PARA>
Q5 - Question: I have downloaded the latest snapshot, and compiled it successfully under Linux 2.0.33 running on an IBM Thinkpad 560E. In the absence of any other IrDA machines to test with, is it safe to assume that once the module has been inserted and the syslog reports "irattach: Serial connection established.", is the IR really working, and will it start to respond once there is another machine with which to talk?
</PARA>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<PARA>
Answer by Dag Brattli: Sorry, this only means that irattach has done its part of the job, which is just to start the irda-tty. Maybe the message should have been different, but as I said, it tells that the serial connection between the irda-chip and the irda-driver is established.

Q7 - Question by Ho Chin Keong: Is there other way of setting up communication between the 2 laptops besides setting up a LAN route between the two?
</PARA>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<PARA>
Answer by Dag Brattli: Yes and no! One of the IrDA standard, IrCOMM permits you to emulate a serial cable between two laptops, so you can use any application written for serial ports (terminals, PPP, slip, etc.). This is however not yet implemented in Linux/IrDA. The IrLPT (printer) support is actually a subset of IrCOMM, so some of it is working! 
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<PARA>
Q8 - Question by Ho Chin Keong: If I block the infrared path deliberately for more than 10 seconds, the connection could not re-establish. I have to kill the irattach and restart the whole procedure to start the infrared route. The connection could be maintained, however, if the blocking is less than 10 seconds. Is this part of the design or a bug? Is there any way whereby we can lengthen this time limit from 10 s to longer or infinitely? 
</PARA>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<PARA>
Answer by Thomas Davis: This seems to be a bug in the primary side of the IrLAP/IrLMP code. It appears not to send the reset/disconnect notice all the way back up the stack. You'll notice it when IrLPT gets stuck in the query mode while you were trying to talk to a printer, and disconnected/interrupted it when it was handshaking. (and now, it shows up in the IrLAN portion)

Q12 - By Rui Oliveira: I am having a problem connecting a PalmIII to a Linux box with an Actisys 220L adapter. With a motherboard adapter (no brand but, I think, similar to the Actisys 210L) I simply redirect a pilot syncronization tool (pilot-xfer) to <filename>/dev/ttyS1</filename> which has the ir adapter attached and, using IrLink in SIR mode, I can get the Linux box to talk with the PalmIII. Trying the above through a serial port with a serial-irda Actisys 220L adapter I can't get this to work. My question is :What happens if one just throws data into a serial port with a irda adapter?
</PARA>

<PARA>
Answer by Lichen Wang: In terms of hardware, IrDA SIR needs a serializer- deserializer, an encoder-decoder, and a transceiver. The UART that drives the COM port of any PC is a serializer-deserializer. In some PC, there is also an encoder-decoder which can be enabled or disabled by the BIOS. When it is disabled, the COM port is usable as an old COM port. When the encoder-decoder is enabled, usually the COM port is no longer usable but an IrDA port is now usable instead.

Actisys IR-210 is a SIR transceiver and thus can be used if the PC has this kind of UART with an IrDA encoder-decoder and the BIOS has enabled it. Under this hardware configuration, you need to tell the Windows setup program that you have "standard infrared devices" and with "Built-in Infrared port on laptop or desktop".

Actisys IR-220, on the other hand, includes both the encoder-decoder and the transceiver. It is designed to be used with a regular UART. If the UART in the PC has also the encoder-decoder built-in, you must use BIOS to disable that. Under either of this hardware configuration, you need to tell the Windows setup program that you have an "ACTiSYS" manufactured "ACT-IR220L Infrared Wireless Interface".

To answer your question: In addition to throwing data at the serial port, you need to tell the UART and the encoder-decoder what data rate to use. In the case of a built-in encoder-decoder, when you set the data rate of the UART, the encoder-decode also get set correctly. In the case a separate encoder-decoder, you need to tell both of them the data rate separatly.

That should avoid the DNS lookups. ... If both machines are in a private test environment, put the following line in the <filename>/etc/host.conf</filename>, <command>order hosts, bind</command>.

<ListItem>

<PARA>
Answer by Dag Brattli: If you still have Win95 on your machine, you should go to the device manager and change the PnP setup for the IrDA port (something else than the stuff your're already using). You could for example move away ttyS1 (in Win95), so that it uses the values that the PCMCIA card is going to steal, and then use the settings from ttyS1 for ttyS2. 


<ProgramListing>
dagbnb ~/linux/test/ &gt; cat /etc/sysconfig/pcmcia 
PCMCIA=yes
PCIC=i82365
PCIC_OPTS="irq_list=7,9,10"
CORE_OPTS=
</ProgramListing>

... should make sure the PCMCIA controller stays away from irq 11. Also make sure that the IrDA port is enabled in Win95 since it's disabled by default.

SIR operates at higher rates, and is meant for long range transmission where you need more than a few characters pass through (unlike a remote control).

You can use SIR to receive Remote Control signals. Set your baud rate nice and low and data will come through. BUT, from my experience, it's not the RIGHT data. It's not being analyzed in the right way, and as such, you can't compute the checksums or check it with its complement.

</PARA>

<PARA>
Briefly, ASKIR uses 9.6 Kbps (19.2 and 38.4 Kbps are also possible) asynchronous data format of 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and odd parity. The <Emphasis remap="it">start</Emphasis> bit as well as all 0 bit in data/parity are transmitted as IR square wave at 500 KHz (DASK sub-carrier). The <Emphasis remap="it">stop</Emphasis> bit as well as all 1 bit in data/parity are represented by the absence of any IR transmission.
</PARA>

<PARA>
As you can see, this is totally incompatible with existing IR remote control. [..]
</PARA>

<PARA>
True. Not only can you use SIR hardware to <Emphasis remap="it">receive</Emphasis>, you can transmit, too. Of course, there are some limitations.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Most IR remote controls use 38 KHz sub-carrier. 3 times 38 is 114, very close to 115.2. You can set the UART to operate at 115.2 Kbps, 7 data bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit - a total of 9 bits. Each 3 cycles of the 38 KHz sub-carrier can be <Emphasis remap="it">received</Emphasis> or <Emphasis remap="it">transmitted</Emphasis> as a byte of 0x5B. 
</PARA>

<PARA>
There are some physical limitations in addition to the fact that the sub-carrier must be 38 KHz. The SIR <Emphasis remap="it">receiver</Emphasis> is not as sensitive to 38 KHz as the IR remote receiver designed for that. The SIR <Emphasis remap="it">transmitter</Emphasis> has a much lower duty cycle and thus can not emit a strong sub-carrier either.
</PARA>

<PARA>
IR remote encodes the control signal by turning on and off the sub-carrier at certain specific patterns. Now that you can <Emphasis remap="it">transmit</Emphasis> and <Emphasis remap="it">receive</Emphasis> the sub-carrier, what remains is all in timing.
</PARA>

<PARA>
For <Emphasis remap="it">transmit</Emphasis>, you have to know how many consecutive bytes of 0x5B to send for each burst of the sub-carrier, and how long to be quiet between the bursts.
</PARA>

<PARA>
For <Emphasis remap="it">receive</Emphasis>, you have to know how many of the 0x5Bs you received are consecutive, and how long the gaps were between these groups of consecutive bytes. [..]
</PARA>

<PARA>
My experience with the IrDA link distance of SIR, MIR and FIR is somewhat different from what Ryan said. [..]
</PARA>

<PARA>
SIR, MIR and FIR should all work from 0 to 100 cm but in practice:
</PARA>

<PARA>
(a) Some devices may have problems at <Emphasis remap="it">LONG</Emphasis> distances.
</PARA>

<PARA>
When possible, place the two communicating devices no more than 50 cm apart. Low power devices, such as pagers, phones, etc. may have even shorter ranges despite the fact that they use SIR instead of MIR or FIR.
</PARA>

<PARA>
(b) Some devices may have problems at <Emphasis remap="it">SHORT</Emphasis> distances.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Place the two devices at least a few cm apart. Putting the two devices too close to each other can cause troubles. 
</PARA>

<PARA>
It is somewhat intuitive that when the link is not reliable we put the two devices closer together. But it is counterintuitive that too close is not good either. The reason is that the light intensity at 1 cm is 10.000 times brighter than that at 100 cm. At 0.5 cm, it is 40.000 times, etc. The IR receiver manufacturers have difficulties to cover this huge dynamic range. We all have problems reading under a 10 W light bulb, but imagine how it feels under a 100.000 W light!
</PARA>

<PARA>
The IrDA Physical Layer is totally incompatible with the DASK modulation used in IR remote controls. Thus it is not possible to use the same controller function for both FIR and remote control. However, practically all FIR controller chips do include some additional functions to support remote control. National, SMC, and Winbond (just to name a few) all have such I/O chips.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The IR transmitter for FIR and remote control are very similar. I have tried a standard FIR transmitter. It can reach 10 meters for remote control purpose. Thus it performs just as good as transmitters designed for remote control.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The IR receiver for FIR and remote control are somewhat different. A FIR receiver can receive remote control signals but can reach only 1 meter whereas receivers designed for remote control typically can reach 10 meters.
</PARA>

<PARA>
I have an ISA bus adapter with a National I/O chip that supports both FIR and remote control. I also have IR Dongles that include both FIR and remote control receivers. (Plus a transmitter for both modes.) I cannot find any software to support remote control functions. I did my own experiments in DOS (I cannot run Linux yet.) Anybody interest in this? "

I currently don't know about any remote controls using IrControl standard, but there should be some out there (anyone else who knows better?). You should go to the IrDA site (http://www.irda.org) and get the physical layer standard (which includes IrControl I think).
</PARA>

<PARA>
"Normal" IrDA (using IrLAP) is _not_ well suited for remote control because of the connection oriented nature (and just supports 9600bps for connectionless use). The reason for the limited range is eye-safety they say (but I currently don't know why CIR works better using the same power). I have however seen laptops connect at 4-5 meters (but I don't think that any high speed communication would be possible).
</PARA>

<PARA>
Most IrDA chipsets are capable of CIR operation, and it is quite easy to modify the drivers so they talk CIR. Takahide Higuchi has started to look at IrSockets and it would be great if we could open a "raw" Ir(DA) socket which then could send and receive CIR packets. Then all the CIR applications could live in userspace.
</PARA>

I know that Corel is interested in using CIR for controlling the NetWinder (and they actually have running code). Take a look at <ULink

Fortunately, many IrDA devices are compatible with the 38-kbps ASK modulation used in TV remotes. This means that they can work with such kind of infrared type signals. ... However, it seems that there are still many portable computers that can't receive TV infrared stuff. 
</PARA>

<PARA>
For desktop computers, there exist <Emphasis remap="it">two</Emphasis> options, depending on the motherboard you have. Usually a Pentium MoBo has an I/O chipset ready for infrared communication. There is a special connector where you can connect the transducer. The other option is buying a serial type transceiver that connects to the standard serial port (RS-232) of the computer. ... PC Remote Control has been tested with success using both type of IrDA devices:
</PARA>

<PARA>
1) IRmate IR-210 Serial Port Infrared Adapter. ... The serial port speed at wich the device sends recognizable data values is 2400 bps. I don't know if this speed will be the same for all the adapters of this type or is an unique characteristic of this model.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Look at the examples of data values received to see how similar are them. There are some infrared commands that change a lot every time, difficulting the recognition. In such cases, a great tolerance in the comparison could be used, but the risk of confusion between different commands will be increased. An apropiate tolerance value for almost all cases is 20.
</PARA>

<PARA>
2) Actisys IR2000L connected to an Asus P2B motherboard. ... There are several serial port speeds that work well, although 4800 bps seems to be the best one. Other adapters of this same type work also well using this speed. Take a look at the samples of data sequences received using this device. Some remote buttons send exactly the same sequence and it's impossible to distinguish between them at all.
</PARA>

<PARA>
3) Asus IR-eye connected to the same MoBo as above. It works as well as the Actisys device.
</PARA>

<PARA>
TV remotes send commands only one way, in a low-speed burst for distances of up to 30 feet. They use directed IR with LEDs that have a moderate cone angle to improve ease-of-use characteristics. Cordless connectivity via IrDA transfers files, point-to-point and bidirectionally, in a high-speed burst for short distances using directed IR with LEDs having a narrow cone angle. IrDA transmissions require relatively careful aiming, and they're easy to block. For this reason, don't expect a great distance while working with the remote unit.

My guess is that to get LIRC working with it, you should just need ... to read from the IrCOMM virtual serial device (as you would with a /dev/cua or whatever) and use a remote that can be seen by your dongle+IrDAheader pair."

<PARA>
Answer by Dag Brattli: "You are talking about being <Emphasis remap="it">normal</Emphasis> serial ports, but that is something at least I have choosen IrDA not to be. I have implemented all the device drivers as network device drivers, so things are a bit different (more frame oriented). The device drivers deliver IrDA frames and currently nothing else.
</PARA>

<PARA>
But I don't think that we must have a tty interface to the IrDA device drivers in order to support more <Emphasis remap="it">RAW</Emphasis> reads and writes. And btw. forget about IrCOMM, it has nothing to do with this issue.
</PARA>

<PARA>
I have actually already implemented support for <Emphasis remap="it">raw</Emphasis> reads and writes for the device drivers, since some of the dongles require this."

<TITLE>Infrared Light and Eye Safety</TITLE>

<PARA>
This section summarizes some ideas and thoughts that were exchanged on the Linux/IrDA mailing list. It is not medically wellfounded, and whoever has better evidence or some more wellfounded source of information is encouraged to contribute it to this HOWTO.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The IrDA spec says that the range of IrDA devices has been limited to 1m for reasons of eye safety. Another plausible assumption is that power consumption and IR pollution/crosstalk were reasons for this limitation. In principle there could be danger for the eye, because infrared light is not registered by the eye, and thus the pupil won't close in order to protect the retina from bright IR light sources. This is the same situation as with UV light, which will cause snow blindness eventually, but in contrast to UV light, IR light contains much less harmful energy due to its longer wavelength.

The only legal restrictions and medical advices we were able to find on the web were concerned with infrared emissions of heat lamps or in the welding process and IEC 825-1 (CENELEC EN60825-1). This suggests that IR light as emitted by IrDA devices will be harmless, since even the peak power emitted by strong IR LEDs (ca. 300mW) is several orders of magnitude below the power emitted by medical IR heat lamps (up to 500W). For these, however, you are supposed to wear protective goggles, so maybe if you are looking straight into 1.000 infrared LEDs flashing at once, you should do so, too. The effect of infrared light is mostly heat, though, and not an alteration or destruction of the biological cell structure, such as caused by UV light. Though in the specs for the HP OmniBook 800 Hewlett-Packard recommends not to look directly into the IR LED.
</PARA>

<PARA>
As stated above, this discussion is only based on guesswork and common sense assumptions about the data found in IR LED and heat lamp specs. If anybody with a better medical knowledge can comment on this, please do so!!!

Though I hope trademarks will be superfluous sometimes (you may see what I mean at <ULINK

>Open Source Definition</ULINK
>), I declare: If certain words are trademarks, the context should make it clear to whom they belong. For example "MS Windows NT" implies that "Windows NT" belongs to Microsoft (MS). "Mac" is a trademark by Apple Computer. Many of the designations used by manufacturers and sellers to distinguish their products are claimed as trademarks. Where those designations appear in this book, and I was aware of a trademark claim, the designations have been printed in caps or initial caps. All trademarks belong to their respective owners.

<TITLE>0. PREAMBLE</TITLE>
<PARA>
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure
everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered
responsible for modifications made by others. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same
sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation:
a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to
software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 
</PARA>
</SECT2>

<SECT2>
<TITLE>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</TITLE>
<PARA>
This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you". 
</PARA>
<PARA>
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or
with modifications and/or translated into another language. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship
of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that
could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary
Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with
related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
notice that says that the Document is released under this License. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that
says that the Document is released under this License. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available
to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for
images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for
input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an
otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is
not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque". 
</PARA>
<PARA>
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML
produced by some word processors for output purposes only. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. 
</PARA>
</SECT2>

<SECT2>
<TITLE>2. VERBATIM COPYING</TITLE>
<PARA>
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License,
the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.
If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 
</PARA>
</SECT2>

<SECT2>
<TITLE>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</TITLE>
<PARA>
If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover,
and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.
The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on
the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network
location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public
has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must
take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of
copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 
</PARA>
</SECT2>
<SECT2>
<TITLE>4. MODIFICATIONS</TITLE>
<PARA>
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that
you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these
things in the Modified Version: 
</PARA>
<PARA>
     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
     versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as
     a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
</PARA>
<PARA>
     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
     Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
     less than five).
</PARA>
<PARA>
     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
     under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
     license notice. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
     I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
     publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section entitled "History" in the Document,
     create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item
     describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document,
     and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in
     the "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the
     Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
     K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all
     the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the
     equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
     M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
     N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. 
</PARA>

<PARA>
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add
their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other
section titles. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
definition of a standard. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to
the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text
may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same
cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another;
but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 
</PARA>
</SECT2>

<SECT2>
<TITLE>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</TITLE>
<PARA>
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above
for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a
single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section
unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
combined work. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications". You must
delete all sections entitled "Endorsements." 
</PARA>
</SECT2>

<SECT2>
<TITLE>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</TITLE>
<PARA>
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the
individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document. 
</PARA>
</SECT2>

<SECT2>
<TITLE>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</TITLE>
<PARA>
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the other
self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
derivative works of the Document. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate. 
</PARA>
</SECT2>

<SECT2>
<TITLE>8. TRANSLATION</TITLE>
<PARA>
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this License, the original English version will prevail. 
</PARA>
</SECT2>

<SECT2>
<TITLE>9. TERMINATION</TITLE>
<PARA>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other
attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
</PARA>

<SECT2>
<TITLE>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</TITLE>
<PARA>
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version
of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified
version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not
specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
Foundation.
