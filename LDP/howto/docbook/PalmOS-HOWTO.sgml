<abstract>

<para>
This HOWTO describes the use of Palm OS devices with Linux. Most
of the advice is applicable to any version of the Palm PDA, and also to
other devices that use the Palm OS, such as the Handspring Visor and Sony Clie. 
Many of the tools described here will also work with other types of Unix, such
as FreeBSD.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis role="bold">NOTE: </emphasis> this is a work in progress. There's a 
lot more I want to write, and I've noted areas that need work (look for
TODO in the text). This version is very much an early draft to get the
ball rolling. I would especially appreciate feedback from users of other
combinations of PDA and Linux distribution (I currently use an m505 with
Mandrake 8.1).

<sect1 id="introduction"><title>Introduction</title>

<para>
This document describes how to connect your PalmOS PDA to
a computer running Linux, and synchronise the PDA data with local
applications.
</para>


<sect2 id="disclaimer"> <title>DISCLAIMER</title>

<para>
As always with information you read on the net, proceed with
caution. Most of the information in this HOWTO has been tested with the
devices to which I have access; an original Palm Pilot Pro and a new
Palm m505. I have tried to indicate instances where I have not been able
to test the information.
</para>

<para>
If you have access to Windows or a Mac, I would recommend
backing up your PDA with the provided software before testing it under
Linux. Otherwise, take a backup with the Linux software before attempting
to synchronise.

</para>


</sect2>

</sect1>


<sect1 id="pc-connect"> <title>Connecting to the PC</title>

<para>
The first step to getting your PDA running under Linux is to connect it
to your PC. Until recently, all PalmOS devices connected via a serial
cable. The latest devices use USB, and some can also connect via infrared.
</para>


<para>
Another development allows the PDA to physically connect to one
machine on the network and synchronise remotely with another machine.
</para>


<sect2 id="pc-connect-serial"> <title>Serial Connection</title>

<para>
The serial connection is currently the easiest way to connect
your PDA to your PC. Simply connect the cradle to a serial port,
then refer to that port when using coldsync or the pilot-link
suite. The serial connection is slow, but has the advantage of
being tried and tested. It should work with any Palm OS device for
which a serial cable is available. Serial cradles and cables are
available as accessories for the Palm PDAs, including those which
come with USB cradles as standard.
</para>

<para>
For convenience, you may wish
to create a device called <literal remap="tt">/dev/pilot</literal>
as a link to the serial port. The pilot-link suite uses this device
by default, so if the link exists it will save you having to specify
it each time you call one of the programs. 
</para>

<para>
To create the link, log on as root and enter the following command: 
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
ln -s /dev/ttyS0 /dev/pilot
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
Replace <literal remap="tt">/dev/ttyS0</literal> with
the serial port to which you have connected the your PDA. The device
name <literal remap="tt">/dev/ttyS0</literal> corresponds to COM1 in
DOS/Windows terminology, <literal remap="tt">/dev/ttyS1</literal> is
COM2, and so on.  
</para>

<para>
You also need to ensure that you have
permission to write to the serial port. On a standalone workstation you
can change the permissions to allow global access to the port. As root,
enter the following command: 
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
chmod a+rw /dev/ttyS0
</programlisting> 
</para>


<para>
Greater security can be achieved using the group permissions. Set
the permissions to read/write for the group and add the required
users to the user list for the group (see <literal remap="tt">man
group</literal>). (TODO: More detail).  
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="devfs"><title>Devfs device naming</title>

<para>
Recent Linux distributions may use devfs for device naming. In
this case <literal remap="tt">/dev/ttyS0</literal> may not exist, or may
be a symbolic link to <literal remap="tt">/dev/tts/0</literal>. This is
a new naming scheme brought in with the 2.4 kernel. Simply replace all
references to <literal remap="tt">/dev/ttyS0</literal> with <literal
remap="tt">/dev/tts/0</literal>.  
</para>
<para>
If you use symbolic links with devfs, you may find that the links do not persist 
correctly after you reboot. The <computeroutput>/etc/devfsd.conf</computeroutput>
 file controls the creation of symbolic links to dynamically created devices.
</para>

<para>
As always, the operation seems to be set up differently under different
 distributions.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Manrake 8.1 creates a link from /dev/usb/tts/1 to /dev/pilot when the hotsync 
button is pressed on the cradle.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
RedHat 7.2 requires the link to be created manually. The link is then persistent 
across boots (thanks to Jim Mueller for this information).
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>


</sect2>

<sect2 id="pc-connect-usb"> <title>USB Connection</title>

<para>
USB access to Palm devices is relatively new. The Handspring
Visor seems to be well supported, and works with the pilot-link
suite. Currently, the Palm m500 series only works with coldsync, although
pilot-link support is in active development. <emphasis>Update:</emphasis> 
the current development version of pilot-link, 0.10.x, has support for 
USB devices. See the pilot-link section for more about this release. 
</para>

<para>
To use any
USB device under Linux, you need to have USB support in your kernel. You
will also need the relevant modules available. Most (TODO: Check which
distros work out of the box) recent Linux distributions have USB support
enabled by default. To check your system, try the following command as
root: 
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
modprobe visor
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
If you get no output from this command, then the module is available and
you do not need to recompile your kernel. If this does not work, try the
alternative usbserial module: 
</para>

<programlisting>
modprobe usbserial
</programlisting>

<para>
This is used by some distributions, such as
Redhat 7.0.
</para>

<para>
If you need to set up USB support in your kernel, the
<ulink url="http://www.linuxpda.com/visor/howto/current/">Handspring
Visor with Linux mini-HOWTO</ulink> provides instructions. (TODO:
Incorporate into this HOWTO?)  
</para>

<para>
Once USB support is set
up, you should use device <computeroutput>/dev/ttyUSB1</computeroutput>
to communicate with your PDA. Note that this device name only exists
<emphasis>after</emphasis> you have pressed the hotsync button on the
cradle. You must press the button before running the connection software.
</para>

<para>
If you have problems synchronising via USB, try an updated kernel. There 
may be some timing issues with the USB driver. For example, I found that 
stock Mandrake 8.1 did not work on one PC, but worked first time on a faster
 PC. Upgrading to a stock 2.4.17 kernel solved the problem and worked fine on
 both PCs.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="pc-connect-infrared"> <title>IR Connection</title>
<para>
The latest Palm devices have infrared (IrDA) ports. If
you have one of these, and a PC with an infrared port, you can
synchronise over IrDA and do away with the cables altogether.

</para>
<para>
David A. Desrosiers has written a comprehensive <ulink
url="http://www.pilot-link.org/howto/irhsync/">HOWTO</ulink> on the
subject. (TODO: Include this inline?)  
</para>


</sect2>

<sect2 id="pc-connect-network"> <title>Network Connection</title>

<para>
It is possible to physically connect your PDA to one PC,
and synchronise it with another PC elsewhere on the network. This
might be a useful feature if you need to synchronise with a PC to
which you cannot physically connect your PDA.  
</para>

<para>
Once again David A. Desrosiers has written a (less comprehensive) <ulink
url="http://www.pilot-link.org/howto/nhsync">HOWTO</ulink> on the
subject. (TODO: Include this inline? Not convinced of the value of this
method - anyone care to comment?)  
</para>


</sect2>
</sect1>


<sect1 id="pilotlink"><title>The pilot-link suite</title>

<para>
The pilot-link suite provides the tools for communicating with
your PDA. The pilot-link programs provide the background functionality for
many higher level programs, but can also be used on their own as command
line tools.  
</para>

<para>
Most distributions come with the pilot-link
suite available as an optional package. The package will be available on
the installation media or from the ftp site of the distribution. Install
the package in the usual way for your distribution. You may also need
development versions of the packages if you wish to compile any software
that uses pilot-link.  
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>Note:</emphasis> Unless otherwise specified, the details below refer 
to the 0.9.x release of
pilot-link. The version in development is 0.10.x. This version contains 
support for USB devices, and has been updated to ensure greater consistency 
between the various utilities. Once 0.10.x is officially released, this 
document will be updated for the new version.
</para>

<para>
If you upgrade to 0.10.x, you will also need to update applications which use
pilot-link. In particular, J-Pilot and gnome-pilot need modifications to work with 
0.10.x.  J-Pilot 0.99.2 should work with the 
latest version of pilot-link.
</para>

<sect2 id="pilotlink-installing"><title>Installing the pilot-link 
software</title>
<para>
The pilot-link suite comes with most major
Linux distributions, including RedHat, Mandrake, SUSE and Debian. If
you intend to compile applications which rely on pilot-link, you
may need to install development packages as well.  
</para>

<para>
If you use a distribution that does not come with pilot-link, or you
need a more recent version, you can find the latest release at <ulink
url="http://www.pilot-link.org/">www.pilot-link.org</ulink>. As well as
the current version, you will find a link to the latest CVS snapshot.
</para>

<para>
Once you have the downloaded the source, unpack and
compile it as follows: 
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
tar -zxvf pilot-link.0.9.5.tar.gz cd pilot-link.0.9.5
./configure
make
make install
</programlisting> 
</para>

<para>
The programs can be run directly from
the directory in which they were compiled. You may wish to test them
before running <computeroutput>make install</computeroutput>. For more
information, see the README file that comes with pilot-link.  
</para>


</sect2>

<sect2 id="pilotlink-using"><title>Using the pilot-link software</title>

<para>
Most of the programs in the <Literal
remap="tt">pilot-link</Literal> suite are <emphasis>conduits</emphasis>,
that is they transfer data into or out of your Palm OS device.  
</para>


<para>
Each time you use of one of the programs, press the HotSync button
on your PDA's cradle.  This will initiate the PDA
side of the data transfer.  Note that not all of these programs prompt
you to press the `HotSync' button, so you may have to remember to do
it yourself.  
</para>


<para>
For more details, view the corresponding manual
page.  There is an overview manual page under the name
<computeroutput>pilot-link</computeroutput>.
</para>


<para>
The pilot-link programs all use the same method of determining the
location of your PDA: 
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
If a device is specified on the command line, that device will be used
regardless of the other settings.  
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
If the environment variable <computeroutput>$PILOTPORT</computeroutput>
is set, that will be used unless a port is specified on the command line.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
If no port is specified on the
command line, and the <computeroutput>$PILOTPORT</computeroutput> variable
is not set, <computeroutput>/dev/pilot</computeroutput> will be used.
</para>

</listitem>
</itemizedlist>


<sect3 id="pilot-xfer"> <title>pilot-xfer</title>

<para>
Possibly the most useful program in the pilot-link suite,
<computeroutput>pilot-xfer</computeroutput> allows you to install programs
on your Palm OS device, make a backup, and restore that backup.  
</para>


<para>
To install a program:
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -i program.prc
</programlisting>
</para>


<para>
To backup your Palm OS device:
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -b backup-directory
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
This will copy all of the databases on your Palm OS device, (including
programs?)  to a directory called ``backup-directory'', creating it if
it does not already exist.  
</para>

<para>
To restore data to Palm OS device:
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -r backup-directory
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
Generally, you will only need to do this if your Palm OS device loses
power or if you have to do a hard reset.  
</para>


<para>
To list the programs on your Palm OS device:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>
pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -l
</programlisting>
</para>


</sect3>

<sect3 id="install-memo"><title>install-memo</title>
<para>
To install a memo into your (already existing) 
<emphasis remap="it">project</emphasis> category: 
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
install-memo /dev/pilot -c project project.memo
</programlisting> 
</para>

<para>
The name of the
file will be inserted into the memo as its first line and will appear
in the directory of memos on your Palm OS device.  
</para>


</sect3>

<sect3 id="memos"><title>memos</title>

<para>
 This program grabs each memo from the Palm OS device and prints
it out in standard mailbox format.  
</para>


<para>
 To view your memos: 
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
memos /dev/pilot
</programlisting>

</para>


</sect3>

<sect3 id="connect-pilot-addresses"><title>pilot-addresses</title>

<para>
Transfer the address database to or from your PDA.  
</para>

<para>
To write your address data to a Linux file from your PDA: 
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
pilot-addresses /dev/pilot -w storage.file
</programlisting>
</para>


<para>
To read your address data from a Linux file onto your PDA: 
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>
pilot-addresses /dev/pilot -r file
</programlisting>
</para>

</sect3>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="coldsync"><title>Coldsync</title>
<para>
Coldsync is an alternative to the pilot-link suite for transferring data to
and from your PalmOS device. Like pilot-link, it can synchronise,
backup and restore Palm databases.  
</para>

<para>
There are fewer applications available which use coldsync as their backend. That
 may change, but it seems to reflect a difference in philosophy between coldsync
and pilot-link. Applications that sync using pilot-link tend to build
in the functionality for synchronisation. It is therefore the author
of the application that decides to include pilot-link support.  
</para>

<para>
Coldsync takes a different approach. Conduits can be written to
use coldsync with almost any application. The synchronisation process
can be entirely transparent to the application. If the application author
is not interested in adding PDA support, it does not matter. As long as
the data format of the application is available, someone else can write
the conduit.  
</para>

<sect2 id="coldsync-installing"><title>Installing coldsync</title>

<para>
Some Linux distributions are carrying coldsync, but it is
not yet as widely available as pilot-link. It is also a younger
application, so you are more likely to need to compile from source.
</para>

<para>
You can find the latest release of coldsync at <ulink
url="http://www.ooblick.com/software/coldsync/">
www.ooblick.com/software/coldsync</ulink>.
As well as the current version, you will find a link to the latest
CVS snapshot.  
</para>

<para>
Once you have the downloaded the source,
compile it as follows: 
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
tar -xvzf
colsync-2.2.5.tar.gz
cd coldsync-2.2.5
./configure
make
make install
</programlisting> 
</para>
 
<para>
You can run coldsync directly from the
<computeroutput>src</computeroutput> directory. For more information,
see the README file that comes with coldsync.  
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="coldsync-using"><title>Using coldsync</title>

<sect3><title>The .coldsyncrc file</title>

<para>
By default, coldsync reads configuration parameters from a file called
<computeroutput>.coldsyncrc</computeroutput> in your home directory. The
<computeroutput>-f</computeroutput> flag overrides the default if
you need to use an alternative configuration file. In addition, some
of the parameters in the configuration file can be set or overridden
on the command line.  
</para>

<para>
 The following is an example of
a <computeroutput>.coldsyncrc</computeroutput> file: 
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
listen serial {
	device: "/dev/palm";
	protocol: default;
	transient;
}

pda "My Palm" {
	snum: "L0PK17C13832-M";
	username: "Sean";
	userid: 1234;
	directory:
	"/home/sean/m505";
	default;
}
</programlisting> 
</para>

<para>
This example tells coldsync to look for a serial port connection on
<computeroutput>/dev/palm</computeroutput>. The transient keyword
tells coldsync that the device may not exist until the user presses
the Hotsync button. The pda section tells coldsync the serial number
of the device, the username and id of the user and the directory
to which the device will be backed up.	
</para>

<para>
The coldsync configuration file is well documented in the man page 
(<computeroutput>man coldsync</computeroutput>), but it is worth 
repeating some points:
</para>

<para>
<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>
Do not use a userid of 0 in your PDA section. This can lead to a loss of data 
if you need to perform a hard reset of your Palm.  
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
If you have a Palm m505 with a USB cradle under Linux, you
should not use <computeroutput>listen usb</computeroutput>. Instead
use <computeroutput>listen serial</computeroutput> with
<computeroutput>protocol: simple;</computeroutput> 
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist> 
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3> <title>The p5-Palm Perl modules</title>

<para>
P5-Palm is a set of Perl modules for communicating with a Palm device via 
coldsync, and can be downloaded from the coldsync site. The purpose of the 
p5-Palm modules is to simplify and speed up the creation of conduits.  
</para>

<para>
You should install p5-Palm if you want to use any of the coldsync conduits.
You do not need p5-Palm if you will only be using coldsync for simple backups.
</para>

<para>
To install the modules: 
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
tar -zxvf p5-Palm-1.2.4.tar.gz
cd p5-Palm-1.2.4
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install
</programlisting> 
</para>


</sect3>

<sect3><title>Coldsync conduits</title> <para>
 A number
of conduits are available for coldsync. These conduits use
coldsync to synchronise other applications with your PDA. The
conduits generally require the p5-Palm Perl modules described
above.	
</para>

<para>
The list of conduits is available at <ulink
url="http://www.ooblick.com/software/coldsync/conduits/">
http://www.ooblick.com/software/coldsync/conduits/</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
The conduits require an entry in your .coldsyncrc configuration file. To find 
out what should be entered, run <computeroutput>/path/conduit -config
</computeroutput>, where <computeroutput>path</computeroutput> is the 
location of the conduit.

</para>

</sect3>
</sect2>
</sect1>


<sect1 id="apps"><title>Desktop Applications.</title>
<para>
This section
describes applications which can synchronise their data with your PDA. The
applications generally use pilot-link to provide communication with the
PDA. Coldsync provides conduit capabilities to application that are not
specifically written with PDAs in mind.  
</para>


<sect2 id="jpilot"><title>JPilot</title>
<para>
JPilot is a
Personal Information Manager (PIM) that provides a replacement
for the Palm Desktop software provided for Windows and the
Mac. JPilot provides desktop versions of the Palm address book,
todo list, calendar and memopad. JPilot can also be used to install
applications onto the PDA.  
</para>

<para>
JPilot is available with
most Linux distributions. You can also download JPilot from <ulink
url="http://www.jpilot.org/">http://www.jpilot.org</ulink>. To use JPilot
you must have pilot-link installed. As JPilot is a gtk+ application,
you will also need gtk+.  
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="gnome-pilot"><title>Gnome-pilot</title>
<para>
Gnome-pilot
aims to provide PDA connectivity for the Gnome desktop. Gnome-pilot
provides conduits for the Gnome PIM applications, a control centre applet
for configuring the link, and a panel applet for dislaying the hotsync
status.  
</para>

<para>
Gnome-pilot uses a daemon process to communicate
with the PDA via pilot-link. Client applications use the daemon, rather
than call pilot-link directly. The daemon must be running in order
to use the client applications such as the conduits.  
</para>

<para>
Gnome-pilot should be available as part of Gnome. The home page for the
project is at <ulink url="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnome-pilot/">
http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnome-pilot/</ulink>.  
</para>

<para>
Gnome-pilot configuration is done through the Gnome control centre. If you 
have gnome-pilot installed, you should have a "Pilot Link" section under the 
peripherals section of the control centre.
</para>

<sect3 id="gnome-pilot-link"><title>The Pilot Link Applet</title>
<para>
The Gnome control panel Pilot Link applet allows you to configure your PDA for
use with Gnome. You must set up your PDA before you can use any of the Gnome
conduits.
</para>
<para>
The first step is to add a device. Start the Gnome control centre, and click on 
"Pilot Link" in the left hand pane. The right hand pane should show the pilot
 link applet.
</para>

<para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Click on the devices tab, then click "Add". You should see the "Device Settings"
dialog box.

<listitem>
<para>
The "Name" field can contain anything to help you identify the port that you
create.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The "Port" field should contain the port to which you attach your PDA. The port
should be the same as you use for pilot-link.
</para>
</listitem>

<sect3 id="gnome-pilot-conduits"><title>The Pilot Conduits Applet</title>

<para>
Start the Gnome control centre, then click on "Pilot Conduits" in the left hand
pane. If you have a PDA configured in the pilot link applet, you will see a 
list of available conduits. If you have more than one PDA, you can use the 
drop down list to select the one that you wish to configure.
</para>

<para>
Each available conduit starts out disabled. To enable a conduit, select it in 
the list and click on "Enable". You will then be given a choice of methods for
synchronisation.

<sect2 id="evolution"><title>Evolution</title>
<para>
Evolution is a Microsoft Outlook clone for Gnome from Ximian. Evolution comes 
with a conduit for gnome-pilot. The conduit can be configured through the 
gnome-pilot conduits control centre applet described above.
</para>
<para>
<emphasis role="strong">Warning:</emphasis> Mandrake 8.1 comes with a beta
 version of Evolution. This version seems
to have a bug whereby it does not correctly identify records when synching. 
This can lead to records being duplicated on the PDA.
</para>
<para>
The latest version of Evolution can be downloaded from <ulink 
url="http://www.ximian.com/">http://www.ximian.com</ulink>. Evolution is 
designed mainly for use with Ximian Gnome, and installing it independently
involves resolving a number of dependencies.

<para>
This section is included unchanged from the original document. It's
clearly out of date, and I'm not sure if it's worth keeping in. It's a
bit offtopic for a Linux howto, and the effort of keeping it current
seems a bit pointless. Instead I've added a section detailing devices 
that use the Palm operating system, and which therefore should work with 
the instructions in this HOWTO.
</para>

<para>
There are two versions of
the Pilot.  They are the <emphasis remap="it">1000</emphasis> and the
<emphasis remap="it">5000</emphasis> and have 128k and 512k of RAM,
respectively. They come with Palm OS 1.0 in ROM.  
</para>


<para>
Then came two devices with the name <emphasis
remap="it">PalmPilot</emphasis>.  They are the <emphasis
remap="it">PalmPilot Personal</emphasis> and the <emphasis
remap="it">PalmPilot Professional</emphasis> and have 512k and 1 Meg
of RAM, respectively.  They also have a backlighting feature for the
LCD panel and version 2.0 of the operating system.  The <emphasis
remap="it">Professional</emphasis> also comes with a TCP/IP stack and
a few extra programs built-in.	
</para>


<para>
IBM has released a rebadged version of the PalmPilot Professional,
which they call a <emphasis remap="it">WorkPad</emphasis>.  
</para>


<para>
Now we have the Palm III, which has a redesigned case and an
infrared port, not to mention the 2 Meg of RAM and Palm OS 3.0.  
</para>


<para>
There is an announced product from Qualcomm, called the
<emphasis remap="it">pdQ smartphone</emphasis>, which is a cell phone
that incorporates a Palm OS PDA.  Don't get all excited about it yet,
it will not be released until sometime in 1999.  
</para>


<para>
It is possible to upgrade any Pilot by swapping out the memory
card, which includes both RAM &amp; ROM.  Of course, this doesn't get
you backlighting for the original Pilot series.
