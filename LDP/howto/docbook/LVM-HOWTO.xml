   <chapter><title>What is LVM?</title>

      <para>
         LVM is a Logical Volume Manager implemented by Heinz Mauelshagen for
         the Linux operating system.  As of kernel version 2.4, LVM is
         incorporated in the main kernel source tree.  This does not mean,
         however, that your 2.4.x kernel is up to date with the latest version
         of LVM.  Look at the
         <ulink url="ftp://ftp.sistina.com/pub/LVM/1.0/README">README</ulink>
         for the latest information about which kernels have the latest code in
         them.
      </para>
   </chapter>

   <chapter><title>What is Logical Volume Management?</title>
      <para>
         Logical volume management provides a higher-level view of the disk
         storage on a computer system than the traditional view of disks and
         partitions. This gives the system administrator much more flexibility
         in allocating storage to applications and users.
      </para>

      <para>
         Storage volumes created under the control of the logical volume
         manager can be resized and moved around almost at will, although this
         may need some upgrading of file system tools.
      </para>

      <para>
      The logical volume manager also allows management of storage volumes in
      user-defined groups, allowing the system administrator to deal with
      sensibly named volume groups such as "development" and "sales" rather
      than physical disk names such as "sda" and "sdb".
      </para>

      <sect1><title>Why would I want it?</title>
         <para>
            Logical volume management is traditionally associated with large
            installations containing many disks but it is equally suited to
            small systems with a single disk or maybe two.
         </para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1><title>Benefits of Logical Volume Management on a Small System</title>
         <para>
            One of the difficult decisions facing a new user installing Linux
            for the first time is how to partition the disk drive. The need to
            estimate just how much space is likely to be needed for system
            files and user files makes the installation more complex than is
            necessary and some users simply opt to put all their data into one
            large partition in an attempt to avoid the issue.
         </para>

         <para>
            Once the user has guessed how much space is needed for /home /usr /
            (or has let the installation program do it) then is quite common
            for one of these partitions to fill up even if there is plenty of
            disk space in one of the other partitions.
         </para>
   
         <para>
            With logical volume management, the whole disk would be allocated
            to a single volume group and logical volumes created to hold the /
            /usr and /home file systems. If, for example the /home logical
            volume later filled up but there was still space available on /usr
            then it would be possible to shrink /usr by a few megabytes and
            reallocate that space to /home.
         </para>

         <para>
            Another alternative would be to allocate minimal amounts of space
            for each logical volume and leave some of the disk unallocated.
            Then, when the partitionsstart to fill up, they can be expanded as
            necessary.
         </para>

         <para>
            As an example:
         
            Joe buys a PC with an 8.4 Gigabyte disk on it and installs Linux
            using the following partitioning system:
            <screen>
/boot    /dev/hda1     10 Megabytes
swap     /dev/hda2    256 Megabytes
/        /dev/hda3      2 Gigabytes
/home    /dev/hda4      6 Gigabyes
            </screen>
This, he thinks, will maximize the amount of space available for all his MP3
files.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            Sometime later Joe decides that he want to install the latest
            office suite and desktop UI available but realizes that the root
            partition isn't large enough.  But, having archived all his MP3s
            onto a new writable DVD drive there is plenty of space on /home.
         </para>

         <para>
         His options are not good:
         </para>

         <orderedlist>

            <listitem> 
               <para>
                  Reformat the disk, change the partitioning scheme and
                  reinstall.
               </para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem> 
               <para>
                  Buy a new disk and figure out some new partitioning scheme
                  that will require the minimum of data movement.
               </para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem> 
               <para>
                  Set up a symlink farm from / to /home and install the new
                  software on /home
               </para>
            </listitem>

         </orderedlist>

         <para>
           With LVM this becomes much easier:
         </para>

         <para>
         Jane buys a similar PC but uses LVM to divide up the disk in a similar
         manner:
         </para>

         <screen>
/boot     /dev/vg00/boot    10 Megabytes
swap      /dev/vg00/swap   256 Megabytes
/         /dev/vg00/root     2 Gigabytes
/home     /dev/vg00/home     6 Gigabytes

         </screen>

         <para>
            When she hits a similar problem she can reduce the size of /home by
            a gigabyte and add that space to the root partition.
         </para>

         <para>
            Suppose that Joe and Jane then manage to fill up the /home
            partition as well and decide to add a new 20 Gigabyte disk to their
            systems.
         </para>

         <para>
            Joe formats the whole disk as one partition (/dev/hdb1) and moves
            his existing /home data onto it and uses the new disk as /home. But
            he has 6 gigabytes unused or has to use symlinks to make that disk
            appear as an extension of /home, say /home/joe/old-mp3s.
         </para>

         <para>
            Jane simply adds the new disk to her existing volume group and
            extends her /home logical volume to include the new disk. Or, in
            fact, she could move the data from /home on the old disk to the new
            disk and then extend the existing root volume to cover all of the
            old disk.
         </para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1><title>Benefits of Logical Volume Management on a Large System</title>
         <para>
            The benefits of logical volume management are more obvious on large
            systems with many disk drives.
         </para>

         <para>
            Managing a large disk farm is a time-consuming job, made
            particularly complex if the system contains many disks of different
            sizes.  Balancing the (often conflicting) storage requirements of
            various users can be a nightmare.
         </para>

         <para>
            User groups can be allocated to volume groups and logical volumes
            and these can be grown as required. It is possible for the system
            administrator to "hold back" disk storage until it is required.  It
            can then be added to the volume(user) group that has the most
            pressing need.
         </para>

         <para>
            When new drive are added to the system, it is no longer necessary
            to move users files around to make the best use of the new storage;
            simply add the new disk into an exiting volume group or groups and
            extend the logical volumes as necessary.
         </para>

         <para>
            It is also easy to take old drives out of service by moving the
            data from them onto newer drives - this can be done online, without
            disrupting user service.
         </para>

            device).
         </para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1><title>logical volume (LV)</title>
         <para>
            The equivalent of a disk partition in a non-LVM system.  The LV is
            visible as a standard block device; as such the LV can contain a
            file system (eg. <filename class="directory">/home</filename>).
         </para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1><title>physical extent (PE)</title>
         <para>
            Each physical volume is divided chunks of data, known as physical
            extents, these extents have the same size as the logical extents
            for the volume group.
         </para>
      </sect1>


      <sect1><title>logical extent (LE)</title>
         <para>
            Each logical volume is split into chunks of data, known as logical
            extents.  The extent size is the same for all logical volumes in
            the volume group.
         </para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1><title>Tying it all together</title>
         <para>
            A concrete example will help:
         </para>

         <para>
            Lets suppose we have a volume group called VG1, this volume group
            has a physical extent size of 4MB.  Into this volume group we
            introduce 2 hard disk partitions, /dev/hda1 and /dev/hdb1.  These
            partitions will become physical volumes PV1 and PV2 (more
            meaningful names can be given at the administrators discretion).
            The PV's are divided up into 4MB chunks, since this is the extent
            size for the volume group.  The disks are different sizes and we
            get 99 extents in PV1 and 248 extents in PV2.  We now can create
            ourselves a logical volume, this can be any size between 1 and 347
            (248 + 99) extents.  When the logical volume is created a mapping
            is defined between logical extents and physical extents, eg.
            logical extent 1 could map onto physical extent 51 of PV1, data
            written to the first 4 MB of the logical volume in fact be written
            to the 51st extent of PV1.
         </para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1><title>mapping modes (linear/striped)</title>
         <para>
            The administrator can choose between a couple of general strategies
            for mapping logical extents onto physical extents:
         </para>
         
      <orderedlist>

         <listitem> <para>
            <emphasis role="strong">Linear mapping</emphasis> will assign a
            range of PE's to an area of an LV in order eg., LE 1 - 99 map to
            PV1 and LE 100 - 347 map onto PV2.
         </para> </listitem>

         <listitem><para>
            <emphasis role="strong">Striped mapping</emphasis> will interleave
            the chunks of the logical extents across a number of physical
            volumes eg.,
            <screen>
1st chunk of LE[1] -&gt; PV1[1],

2nd chunk of LE[1] -&gt; PV2[1],

3rd chunk of LE[1] -&gt; PV3[1],

4th chunk of LE[1] -&gt; PV1[2],
            </screen>

            and so on.  In certain situations this strategy can improve the
            performance of the logical volume.  Be aware however, that LVs
            created using striping cannot be extended past the PVs they were
            originally created on.
         </para> </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      </sect1>

      <sect1><title>Snapshots</title>
         <para>
            A wonderful facility provided by LVM is 'snapshots'.  This allows
            the administrator to create a new block device which is an exact
            copy of a logical volume, frozen at some point in time.  Typically
            this would be used when some batch processing, a backup for
            instance, needs to be performed on the logical volume, but you
            don't want to halt a live system that is changing the data.  When
            the snapshot device has been finished with the system administrator
            can just remove the device.  This facility does require that the
            snapshot be made at a time when the data on the logical volume is
            in a consistent state, later sections of this document give some
            examples of this.
         </para>

            Once the patches have been correctly applied, you need to make sure

            The 2.4 kernel comes with LVM already included although you should
            check at the Sistina web site for updates, (eg. v2.4.9 kernels and
            earlier must have the
            <link linkend="buildlvmpatch">latest LVM patch</link> applied

            <emphasis role="strong">Multi-device support (RAID and
            LVM)</emphasis>. LVM can be compiled into the kernel or as a
            module. Build your kernel and modules and install then in the usual
            way. If you chose to build LVM as a module it will be called

            If your kernel was compiled with the /proc file system (most are)
            then you can verify that LVM is present by looking for a /proc/lvm

            volume groups and logical volumes. In addition
            there is a <quote>file</quote> called

            A logical volume must be closed before it can be removed:

<command># umount /dev/myvg/homevol
# lvremove /dev/myvg/homevol</command>
<prompt>lvremove -- do you really want to remove "/dev/myvg/homevol"? [y/n]: </prompt><replaceable>y</replaceable>

      <sect1><title>Extending a logical volume</title>
         <para>
            To extend a logical volume you simply tell the lvextend command how
            much you want to increase the size. You can specify how much to
            grow the volume, or how large you want it to grow to:
            <screen>
<command># lvextend -L12G /dev/myvg/homevol</command>
<computeroutput>lvextend -- extending logical volume "/dev/myvg/homevol" to 12 GB
lvextend -- doing automatic backup of volume group "myvg"
lvextend -- logical volume "/dev/myvg/homevol" successfully extended</computeroutput>
            </screen>
            will extend <filename>/dev/myvg/homevol</filename> to 12 Gigabytes.

lvextend -- doing automatic backup of volume group "myvg"
lvextend -- logical volume "/dev/myvg/homevol" successfully extended</computeroutput>
            </screen>
            will add another gigabyte to <filename>/dev/myvg/homevol</filename>.
         </para>

         <para>
            After you have extended the logical volume it is necessary to
            increase the file system size to match. how you do this depends on
            the file system you are using.
         </para>

         <para>
            By default, most file system resizing tools will increase the size
            of the file system to be the size of the underlying logical volume
            so you don't need to worry about specifying the same size for each
            of the two commands.

                  (it can also do file system shrinking, see the next section)
                  so the single command

            LVM allows you to create PVs (physical volumes) out of almost any
            block device so, for example, the following are all valid commands
            and will work quite happily in an LVM environment:

                     It's easier to keep track of the hardware in a system if

                     LVM can't tell that two PVs are on the same physical disk,
                     so if you create a striped LV then the stripes could be on
                     different partitions on the same disk resulting in a

            The recommended method of partitioning a disk is to create a single
            partition that covers the whole disk. This avoids any nasty
            accidents with whole disk drive device nodes and prevents the
            kernel warning about unknown partition types at boot-up.

         </para>

         <para>
            The normal layout for a Sun disk label is for the first partition
            to start at block zero of the disk, thus the first partition also
            covers the area containing the disk label itself.  This works fine
            for ext2 filesystems (and is essential for booting using SILO) but
            such partitions should not be used for LVM. This is because LVM
            starts writing at the very start of the device and will overwrite
            the disk label.
         </para>

         <para>
            If you want to use a disk with a Sun disklabel with LVM, make sure
            that the partition you are going to use starts at cylinder 1 or
            higher.

            <para>
               If the volume group looks correct, it is time to create a
               logical volume on top of the volume group.
            </para>

            <para>
               You can make the logical volume any size you like.  (It is
               similar to a partition on a non LVM setup.)  For this example we
               will create just a single logical volume of size 1GB on the
               volume group.  We will not use striping because it is not
               currently possible to add a disk to a stripe set after the
               logical volume is created.

               You can make the logical volume any size you like (up to the

               partition on a non LVM setup).  For this example we will create
               just a single logical volume of size 1GB on the volume group.
               The logical volume will be a striped set using for the 4k stripe
               size.  This should increase the performance of the logical
               volume.

      <sect1 id="Snapshots_Backup"><title>Taking a Backup Using Snapshots</title>
         <para>
            Following on from the previous example we now want to use the extra
            space in the "ops" volume group to make a database backup every
            evening. To ensure that the data that goes onto the tape is
            consistent we use an LVM snapshot logical volume.
         </para>

         <para>
            This type of volume is a read-only copy of another volume that
            contains all the data that was in the volume at the time the
            snapshot was created. This means we can back up that volume without
            having to worry about data being changed while the backup is going
            on, and we don't have to take the database volume offline while the
            backup is taking place.
         </para>

         <sect2><title>Create the snapshot volume</title>
            <para>
               There is a little over 500 Megabytes of free space in the "ops"
               volume group, so we will use all of it to allocate space for the
               snapshot logical volume.  A snapshot volume can be as large or a
               small as you like but it must be large enough to hold all the
               changes that are likely to happen to the original volume during
               the lifetime of the snapshot. So here, allowing 500 megabytes of
               changes to the database volume which should be plenty.

               first we have to move the physical extents into the free areas
               of the other volumes (in this case /dev/sdf for volume group dev
               and /dev/sde for volume group ops).

               Having your root filesystem on LVM can significantly complicate
               upgrade procedures (depending on your distribution) so it should
               not be attempted lightly.  Particularly, you must consider how
               you will insure that the LVM kernel module (if you do not have
               LVM compiled into the kernel) as well as the vgscan/vgchange
               tools are available before, during, and after the upgrade.

            <para>
               Having your root filesystem on LVM can significantly complicate
               recovery of damaged filesystems.  If you lose your initrd, it
               will be very difficult to boot your system.  You will need to
               have a recover disk that contains the kernel, LVM module, and
               LVM tools, as well as any tools necessary to recover a
               damaged filesystem.
               Be sure to make regular backups and have an up-to-date
               alternative boot method that allows for recovery of LVM.

            In this example the whole system was installed in a single root
            partition with the exception of /boot. The system had a 2 gig disk
            partitioned as:
            <screen>
/dev/hda1  /boot 
/dev/hda2  swap
/dev/hda3  /
            </screen>
         </para>

         <para>
            The / partition covered all of the disk not used by /boot and swap.
            An important prerequisite of this procedure is that the root
            partition is less that half full (so that a copy of it can be
            created in a logical volume).  If this is not the case then a
            second disk drive should be used. The procedure in that case is
            similar but there is no need to shrink the existing root partition
            and /dev/hda4 should be replaced with (eg) /dev/hdb1 in the
            examples.

            To do this it is easiest to use GNU parted. This software allows
            you to grow and shrink partitions that contain filesystems. It is
            possible to use resize2fs and fdisk to do this but GNU parted makes
            it much less prone to error.  It may be included in your
            distribution, if not you can download it from
            <ulink url="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/parted">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/parted</ulink>.

               Boot into single user mode (type <command>linux S</command> at
               the LILO prompt) This is important. Booting single-user ensures
               that the root filesystem is mounted read-only and no programs
               are accessing the disk.

               on the disk for a complete copy of it in a logical volume. In
               this example a 1.8 gig partition is shrunk to 1 gigabyte
               This displays the sizes and names of the partitions on the disk

               The first number here the partition number (hda3), the second is
               the same starting position that hda3 currently has. Do not
               change this.  The last number should make the partition around

               This makes a new partition to hold the initial LVM data. It

      <sect1><title>Sharing LVM volumes</title>
         <warning><title>LVM is not cluster aware</title>
            <para>
               Be very careful doing this, LVM is not currently cluster-aware
               and it is very easy to lose all your data.
            </para>
         </warning>

         <para>  
            If you have a fibre-channel or shared-SCSI environment where more
            than one machine has physical access to a set of disks then you can
            use LVM to divide these disks up into logical volumes. If you want
            to share data you should really be looking at 
            <ulink url="http://www.sistina.com/gfs">GFS</ulink> or other
            cluster filesystems.
         </para>

         <para>
            The key thing to remember when sharing volumes is that all the LVM
            administration must be done on one node only and that all other
            nodes must have LVM shut down before changing anything on the admin
            node.  Then, when the changes have been made, it is necessary to
            run vgscan on the other nodes before reloading the volume groups.
            Also, unless you are running a cluster-aware filesystem (such as
            GFS) or application on the volume, only one node can mount each
            filesystem.  It is up to you, as system administrator to enforce
            this, LVM will not stop you corrupting your data.
         </para>

         <para>
            The startup sequence of each node is the same as for a single-node
            setup with
            <screen>
vgscan
vgchange -ay
            </screen>
            in the startup scripts.
         </para>

         <para>
            If you need to do <emphasis role="strong">any</emphasis> changes to
            the LVM metadata (regardless of whether it affects volumes mounted
            on other nodes) you must go through the following sequence. In the
            steps below ``admin node'' is any arbirarily chosen node in the
            cluster.
            <screen>
Admin node                   Other nodes
----------                   -----------
                             Close all Logical volumes (umount)
                             vgchange -an
&lt;make changes, eg lvextend&gt;
                             vgscan
                             vgchange -ay
            </screen>
         </para>

         <note><title>VGs should be active on the admin node</title>
            <para>
               You do not need to, nor should you, unload the VGs on
               the admin node, so this can be the node with the highest uptime
               requirement.

         Just telling us that LVM did not work does not provide us with enough
         information to help you.  We need to know about your setup and the
         various components of your configuration.  The first thing you should
         do is check the
         <ulink url="http://lists.sistina.com/pipermail/linux-lvm/">linux-lvm mailing list archives</ulink>
         to see if someone else has already reported the same bug.  If you do
         not find a bug report for a problem similar to yours you should
         collect as much of the following information as possible.  The list is
         grouped into three categories of errors.
