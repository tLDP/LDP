    I wrote this as a beginning for using Portslave with the
    Linux router project. It seems that Portslave is a widely used
    program with no documentation. Since I just dove into using
    Portslave I am sure this document can be improved by others over
    time. After several days of fighting Portslave, I figured out how
    incredibly easy to use it really is.

  Share this with all; sell it to no one.

  <para>
First, I just want to thank all the Linux programmers out there. Your
contributions have made a difference. I hope this small contribution
is useful to the Linux users out there.

  <para>
The trouble I ran into most of the time was PAP Authentication
failure. This was really tough thing to work out (I thought). I also
had a few other errors, but if you follow this How To it should at
least get you started (or start you to the insane asylum).

  <title>The Procedure</title>


<para>
First, you need a running version of LRP - either build the disk yourself
or you can grab an image of mine at: 
<ulink url="http://www.computechnology.com/pslave1440.img">
http://www.computechnology.com/pslave1440.img
</ulink>.
This is a copy of my
working disk and you can directly write an image of it to your disk.
It will get you started. All you will then have to do is change to
the appropriate IP numbers and network card drivers. I won't get into
building a lrp disk here because there seems to be fairly good
documentation on that subject available.
</para>

<para>
Assuming you have your disk built, and you computer running, here is
what we need to do to configure your disk.
</para>

<para>
First, <emphasis>DELETE</emphasis> (yes, I said
<emphasis>DELETE</emphasis>) all <filename>options.tty??</filename>
files, the options file, and pap-secrets files located
under <filename>/etc/ppp-radius</filename> and
<filename>/etc/ppp</filename>. If you have an <filename>/etc/ppp</filename>,
you probably installed <filename>ppp.lrp</filename>. Also
remove <filename>ppp.lrp</filename> from your disk and 
<filename>/etc/ppp</filename> will go away.
</para>

<para>
Next, go to <filename>/etc/portslave</filename> and adjust the 
<filename>pslave.conf</filename> file accordingly. I will now 
take you through that file line-by-line. I don't know what all of it
means but I made it work so you can to.

## The all entry is used as a template for all others. This means that
## setting all.debug to 0, you set s0.debug, s1.debug, s2.debug etc.
## to 0. It also means that all these settings can be overridden on a
## per-port basis below.
##
## The "all." stuff is the default for everything unless you specifically
## override it. I'll show you that at the end of this.

## Tty names are s0...s63. For every port we need to define a tty port, and
## an IP number for when radius tells us to pick one ourself. Unless you
## use the IP pool option mentioned above (IP number with "+" appended).
##
## Note that you can change _all_ of the above settings that start
## with all.xxxx on a per-port basis, such as issue, prompt etc.
##
## This is where you can set options to a specific modem. sX.tty is
## for portslaves use you assign it to a real tty device.
## In the /etc/inittab you will see the lines portlsave 0 or 1 etc..
## this 0 or 1 is the tty device number portslave already knows it is
## "tty something" so all it requires is the last digits. 
##
## Since my modem is on COM 4 (DOS) that means s3.tty is ttyS3

s3.tty ttyS3

# Now I can set options for that modem
#
# Here is it's IP number statically assigned

s3.ipno 10.0.0.202

# Here is the protocol to use on that modem. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION HERE!
# This is the line that finally made portslave work perfectly for me.
# You must tie the ppp protocol to your modem. Simple huh?
