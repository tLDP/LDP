    <abstract>
      <para>
	This document attempts to list most of the hardware known to be
	either supported or unsupported under Linux.

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
      This document lists most of the hardware components (not whole
      computers) known to be supported or not supported under Linux, so
      reading through this document you can choose the components for your
      own Linux computer and know what to avoid. As the list of components
      supported by Linux changes constantly, this document will never be
      complete. If a component is not mentioned in this HOWTO, I simply
      have not found support for the component and nobody has told me about
      support.
    </para>

    <para>
      Subsections titled 'Alpha, Beta drivers' list hardware with alpha or
      beta drivers in varying degrees of usability. Note that some drivers
      only exist in alpha kernels, so if you see something listed as
      supported but isn't in your version of the Linux kernel, upgrade.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="binary-only">
      <title>Notes on binary-only drivers</title>

      <para>
        Some devices are supported by binary-only modules; avoid these when
        you can. Binary-only modules are modules which are compiled for ONE
        kernel version. The source code for these modules has NOT been
        released. This may prevent you from upgrading or maintaining your
        system.  It will also prevent you from using the component on
	alternate (usually non-x86) architectures.
      </para>

      <para>
        Linus Torvalds says <quote>I allow binary-only modules, but I want
        people to know that they are _only_ ever expected to
        work on the one version of the kernel that they were compiled
        for.</quote>  (See

      <title>Notes on proprietary drivers</title>

      <para>
	Various proprietary drivers for sound, video, etc. exist for Linux.
	Tracking these proprietary drivers is beyond the scope of this
	document.  These drivers might be mentioned at various points in
	this document, but note that no effort has been made to make sure
	that this information is current.

      <title>Known problems with this document</title>

      <para>
	This document can't possibly be up-to-date at all times.  I would
	like to see this document be a useful reference again.  The
	following items need to be fixed for that to happen:

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Old cruft needs to be eliminated.  Much of this document was
	      written in 1995, give or take, when PCI was new and not
	      supported terribly well, and ISA PnP was seen as something
	      evil.  Oh, how the times have changed...
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      Also, many of the model numbers listed in this document are
	      no longer available, and are probably not of much interest to
	      the vast majority of people.  Personally, I think hardware
	      that hasn't been available for more than 5 years or so can
	      safely be removed.  Old versions of this document will always
	      be available on the Internet...
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

          <listitem>
	    <para>
	      URLs in this document need updating.  I've begun to do that,
	      but it is a big job...  Diffs are welcome.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      In the process of updating and converting this document to
	      DocBook, some cruft was introduced.  If anyone wants to help
	      clean up this, get the latest source (preferably by emailing
	      me at <email>steve@silug.org</email>) and grep for "FIXME".
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Lists in this HOWTO that are available in other HOWTOs or
	      FAQs need to be either updated here or dropped completely
	      from this document.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Newer interfaces such as USB need to be added into the list.
	      (Would a USB-attached hard drive go under "USB", "Removable
	      drives", "Hard drives", or all of the above?)
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      And, of course, random hardware that just isn't listed in
	      this document needs to be added.

	All of this is going to require a lot of work.  If this happens to
	interest you, please email <email>steve@silug.org</email>.  I can
	use the help.  :-)

      <title>Acknowledgments</title>

      <para>
	This document has passed through many hands.  I don't know if he
	wrote the first version, but in 1993 Ed Carp was maintaining it.
	In August of 1994, FRiC (Boy of Destiny) took over.  After he fell
	off the face of the planet in late 1995 or early 1996 (and we all
	miss him from IRC, I might add), Patrick Reijnen took over
	(sometime in 1997) and continued to maintain this document until
	late 1999.
      </para>

      <para>
	Recent versions of this document contained the following:

	<blockquote>
	  <para>
            Thanks to all the authors and contributors of other HOWTO's,
            many things here are shamelessly stolen from their works; to
            FRiC, Zane Healy and Ed Carp, the original authors of this
            HOWTO; and to everyone else who sent in updates and feedbacks.
            Special thanks to Eric Boerner and lilo (the person, not the
            program) for the sanity checks. And thanks to Dan Quinlan for
            the original SGML conversion.

	    <revremark>
	      Replaced "commercial" with "proprietary" in most cases.  (I
	      should probably go one more step and make that "proprietary,
	      closed-source" or something similar.  Comments and
	      suggestions are appreciated.)
	      Added placeholder <link linkend="ieee1394">IEEE 1394</link>
	      section.
	      Updated various other sections.

	      Removed a lot of cruft.
	      Added information direct from pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net on

	      Added a section on <link linkend="dvd">DVD drives</link>.
	      Thanks to Tom Hanlin for pointing out that there was no mention
	      of them before.
	      Replaced all references to metalab with ibiblio, and all
	      references to linuxdoc.org with tldp.org.
	      Probably other changes I'm forgetting, which should teach me
	      not to wait so long between releases.

      In general, any laptop will support Linux fine.  Some specific
      features (wireless and video especially) may have issues, but these
      should not interfere with basic functionality.

    <para>
      Currently, laptops with the
      <ulink url="http://www.intel.com/products/centrino/">Intel&reg;
      Centrino&trade;</ulink> logo are the most likely to work perfectly under
      Linux.  The Intel PRO/Wireless

      <ulink url="http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/">2200</ulink> 802.11b/g
      wireless cards are supported by drivers released by Intel that are being
      integrated into the stock Linux kernel.  Accelerated 3D support for
      the on-board video is provided by the
      <ulink url="http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/Intel">DRI project</ulink> and
      is included in recent releases of

        AMD's 64-bit Opteron and Athlon64 processors, as well as the mobile

        optionally optimized for Athlons, since that's essentially what
        these processors look like in 32-bit mode.  For 64-bit mode,
        compile a kernel for
	<ulink url="http://www.x86-64.org/">x86_64</ulink>.  It will still
	run 32-bit binaries, assuming all the appropriate libraries are

      BIOS may only be able to detect 64MB of RAM.  If you have this
      problem, when you add more than 64 Mb of memory you have to add the
      following line to your LILO configuration file:

      <blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	<para>
          append="mem=96M"
	</para>
      </blockquote>

      Don't use a number higher than the amount of RAM you really have.
      This will cause crashes.

    <para>
      Linux will work with all video cards in text mode, VGA cards not listed
      below probably will still work with mono VGA and/or standard VGA drivers.
    </para>

    <para>
      If you're looking into buying a cheap video card to run X, keep in mind
      that accelerated cards (ATI Mach, ET4000/W32p, S3) are MUCH faster than
      unaccelerated or partially accelerated (Cirrus, WD) cards.
    </para>

    <para>
      "32 bpp" is actually 24 bit color aligned on 32 bit boundaries.  It
      does NOT mean the cards are capable of 32 bit color, they still
      display 24 bit color (16,777,216 colors).  24 bit packed pixels modes
      are not supported in XFree86, so cards that can do 24 bit modes to
      get higher resolutions in other OS's are not able to do this in X
      using XFree86. These cards include Mach32, Cirrus 542x, S3
      801/805/868/968, ET4000, and others.
    </para>

    <para>
      AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port) support is growing fast.  Most of the
      X-servers (both freely available and proprietary versions) have more
      or less support for AGP. 
    </para>

      <para>
	The following is a list of cards known to work with XFree86
	versions 3.3.6 and/or 4.1.0.  See <ulink
	url="http://www.xfree86.org/">the XFree86 web site</ulink> for
	more information.

	The kernel supports a graphical console on some video cards.  This

	generally do not have text-capable video cards.  It was integrated
	into the kernel in 2.2, and now supports various video cards.

      Linux will work with standard IDE, MFM and RLL controllers. When using
      MFM/RLL controllers it is important to use ext2fs and the bad block
      checking options when formatting the disk.

	    3ware's 5000-series and 6000-series controllers have been
	    supported since kernel 2.2.15.  Support for the 7000-series
	    controllers and RAID5 on the 6000-series controllers requires
	    kernel 2.4.5 or 2.2.20 or better.  Also make sure to use a
	    recent firmware for RAID 5, since older firmware revisions
	    (and older versions of the driver) can cause data
	    corruption when a RAID 5 array runs degraded.  8000-series
	    SATA cards also work fine with recent 2.4.x or 2.6.x kernels.
            9000-series cards are supported with the 3w-9xxx driver
            (instead of the older 3w-xxxx driver).

      Any standard serial/parallel/joystick/combo cards. Linux
      supports 8250, 16450, 16550, and 16550A UART's. Cards that support
      non-standard IRQ's (IRQ &gt; 9) can be used.
    </para>

    <para>
      See National Semiconductor's ``Application Note AN-493'' by
      Martin S. Michael. Section 5.0 describes in detail the
      differences between the NS16550 and NS16550A. Briefly, the
      NS16550 had bugs in the FIFO circuits, but the NS16550A (and
      later) chips fixed those. However, there were very few NS16550's
      produced by National, long ago, so these should be very rare.
      And many of the ``16550'' parts in actual modern boards are from
      the many manufacturers of compatible parts, which may not use
      the National ``A'' suffix. Also, some multiport boards will use
      16552 or 16554 or various other multiport or multifunction chips
      from National or other suppliers (generally in a dense package
      soldered to the board, not a 40 pin DIP). Mostly, don't worry
      about it unless you encounter a very old 40 pin DIP National
      ``NS16550'' (no A) chip loose or in an old board, in which case
      treat it as a 16450 (no FIFO) rather than a 16550A. - Zhahai

          are set using <literal remap="tt">setserial</literal>.)

          Ethernet adapters vary greatly in performance. In general the
          newer the design the better. Some very old cards like the 3Com
          3c501 are only useful because they can be found in junk heaps
          for $5 a time. Be careful with clones, not all are good clones
          and bad clones often cause erratic lockups under Linux. Read the
          <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Ethernet-HOWTO.html">
          Ethernet HOWTO</ulink> for detailed descriptions of various cards.

          For ethernet cards with the DECchip DC21x4x family the
          "Tulip" driver is available. More information on this driver

        OSS supports all MIDI daughter cards including Wave
        Blaster, TB Rio and Yamaha DB50XG. The only requirement is that
        the "host" card is supported by OSS. Note that only the "host"
        card needs to be configured using soundconf. The daughter card
        will be automatically accessible through the MIDI of the "host"
        card.

    <para>
      (From the SCSI HOWTO) All direct access SCSI devices with a
      block size of 256, 512, or 1024 bytes should work. Other block
      sizes will not work (Note that this can often be fixed by changing
      the block and/or sector sizes using the MODE SELECT SCSI
      command).
    </para>

    <para>
      Large IDE (EIDE) drives work fine with newer kernels. The
      boot partition must lie in the first 1024 cylinders due to PC BIOS
      limitations.

      Some Conner CFP1060S drives may have problems with Linux and

      and corrupt file systems. Conner has released a firmware upgrade
      to fix this problem, contact Conner at 1-800-4CONNER (US) or
      +44-1294-315333 (Europe). Have the microcode version (found on
      the drive label, 9WA1.6x) handy when you call.

        All CD-ROM drives should work similarly for reading data.
        There are various compatibility problems with audio CD playing
        utilities. (Especially with newer low-end NEC drives.) Some
        alpha drivers may not have audio support yet.

      of the drivers are often binary-only.  (See the
      <link linkend="binary-only">note</link> on binary-only drivers.) See
      <ulink url="http://www.linmodems.org/">Linmodems.org</ulink> for more
      information on Linux-supported winmodems.
    </para>

    <para>
      Note that there are external USB winmodems on the market now, so be
      very careful when shopping for external modems.
    </para>

    <para>
      Furthermore, many flash upgradable modems only have
      flash programs for Win95/NT. These modems cannot be upgraded under
      Linux.
    </para>

    <para>
      A small number of modems come with DOS software that
      downloads the control program at runtime. These can normally be
      used by loading the program under DOS and doing a warm boot. Such
      modems are probably best avoided as you won't be able to use them
      with non PC hardware in the future.
    </para>

    <para>
      Most 16-bit PCMCIA modems should work with the PCMCIA drivers.
      CardBus modems are usually winmodems much like PCI modems.  Your best
      bet for now is to find a card that lists compatibility with DOS and
      Windows 3.1.
    </para>

    <para>
      All that said, if a modem is known to have a real UART (or hardware
      UART emulation), whether it is ISA, PCMCIA, etc., it should work
      under Linux.
    </para>

    <para>
      Fax modems need appropriated fax software to operate. Also
      be sure that the fax part of the modem supports Class 2 or Class
      2.0. It seems to be generally true for any fax software on unix
      that support for Class 1.0 is not available.
    </para>

    <para>
      An exception to this is the Linux efax program which
      supports both Class 1 and Class 2 fax modems. In some cases there
      can be a few (minor) technical problems with Class 1 modems. If
      you have a choice it is recommend to get a Class 2 modem.
    </para>

    <para>
      See Appendix B <link linkend="incompatible">Linux
      Incompatible Hardware</link> for specific cards known not to work with
      Linux.
    </para>

		Linux PCMCIA Supported Device List

		Last updated: 2004/10/27 05:22:16

The following cards are known to work in at least one actual system.
Other cards may also work -- if you can get a card to work that is not
on this list, please let me know.  This list is complete to the best
of my knowledge.

CardBus cards are listed towards the end of each section.  All 16-bit
PCMCIA drivers have names ending in "_cs".  CardBus drivers included
in the pcmcia-cs package have names ending in "_cb"; for the kernel
PCMCIA subsystem, the drivers for these cards are regular PCI drivers.
Beware that some cards have 16-bit and CardBus versions with similar
names, but completely different implementations.  If the CardBus
version is not specifically listed as supported here, then you should
not expect it to work.

Next to each driver, I've tried to indicate which system architectures
(x86,ppc,axp) are known to be supported.  This information is likely
to be incomplete, and additions/corrections would be very welcome.

	modems that emulate a standard UART are also supported.  Some
	Winmodem drivers do exist (i.e., the ltmodem driver for Lucent
	chipsets).  For more information about WinModems, drivers,

ATA/IDE card drives:

	[ide-cs driver] [x86,ppc,smp]
	Most cards should work fine, including adapters for external
	IDE devices.  Both Flash-ATA cards and 	rotating-media cards
	are supported, including "Smartmedia" flash and Compact flash
	cards.

	The very old Western Digital 40MB drives are not supported,
	because they do not conform to the PCMCIA ATA specification.

The following cards have contributed drivers which are distributed as
separate packages.  The drivers are not included in the base PCMCIA
package for maintenance reasons: they are for less common cards and I
cannot test them.  Most are available on the Linux PCMCIA FTP site, at

their own web sites.

The following cards are NOT supported.  This list is not meant to be
comprehensive: I list these cards because people frequently ask about
them.  In general, there are no technical reasons why a card is not
supported: simply put, as far as I know, no one is working on these
cards, therefore, drivers will not be written.  Most cards on this
list have been there for a very long time, so please do not send me
email just to ask if their status has changed.

The following vendors have assisted in the development of the Linux
PCMCIA driver package by contributing hardware and/or technical
documentation about their products.  It could be inferred that since
these vendors support Linux development and have provided technical
help, that their cards are likely to be better supported under Linux.

      <para>
        The Linux Lab Project site collects drivers for hardware
        dealing with data acquisition, they also maintain some mailing
        lists dealing with the subject. I have no experience with data
        acquisition so please check the site for more details.

    <para>
      More and more, the parallel port is used to connect other
      devices than printers. To support this parallel port drivers are
      written for the devicesto work. This appendix presents devices for
      which parallel port support is written.

      To be clear: printers are not presented in this appendix as
      they are not supported by parallel port support projects.

    <title>Appendix B. Linux incompatible Hardware</title>

    <para>
      Some hardware manufacturers have created devices which are
      compatible with MS-DOS and Windows 95/98 only. They seem to
      emulate part of the normally available hardware in the devices by
      software packages sold together with the device. Specification on
      these devices are not presented to the world so it is almost
      impossible to write drivers for these devices. Below a list of
      devices reported as being Linux incompatible will be given.
    </para>

    <para>
      Simply put, it is best to avoid hardware which states things
      like "Needs Windows" or "Windows only".

              Redudant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks. The basic idea of
              RAID is to combine multiple small, inexpensive disk
              drives into an array of disk drives which yields
              performance exceeding that of a single large expensive
              drive. There are five types of redundant array
              Architectures; RAID-1 through RAID-5. A non-redudant
              array of disk drives is referred to as RAID-0. Some RAID
              systems can mix formats.

              printers. In essence, the protocol moves the low-level
              processing of the data to the host computer rather than
              the printer. This allows for a low-cost printer with a
              small amount of memory and computing power and a flexible
              driver. However, this comes at the price of compatibility.
              HP's decision was to develop drivers only for Windows 95
              for this printer.
