    <abstract>
      <para>
	This document attempts to list most of the hardware known to be
	either supported or unsupported under Linux.
      </para>
    </abstract>

  </artheader>

  <sect1 id="intro">
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
      This document lists most of the hardware components (not whole
      computers) known to be supported or not supported under Linux, so
      reading through this document you can choose the components for your
      own Linux computer and know what to avoid. As the list of components
      supported by Linux changes constantly, this document will never be
      complete. If a component is not mentioned in this HOWTO, I simply
      have not found support for the component and nobody has told me about
      support.
    </para>

    <para>
      Subsections titled 'Alpha, Beta drivers' list hardware with alpha or
      beta drivers in varying degrees of usability. Note that some drivers
      only exist in alpha kernels, so if you see something listed as
      supported but isn't in your version of the Linux kernel, upgrade.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="binary-only">
      <title>Notes on binary-only drivers</title>

      <para>
        Some devices are supported by binary-only modules; avoid these when
        you can. Binary-only modules are modules which are compiled for ONE
        kernel version. The source code for these modules has NOT been
        released. This may prevent you from upgrading or maintaining your
        system.  It will also prevent you from using the component on
	alternate (usually non-x86) architectures.
      </para>

      <para>
        Linus Torvalds says <quote>I allow binary-only modules, but I want
        people to know that they are _only_ ever expected to
        work on the one version of the kernel that they were compiled
        for.</quote>  (See
        <ulink url="http://lwn.net/1999/0211/a/lt-binary.html">http://lwn.net/1999/0211/a/lt-binary.html</ulink>

      <title>Notes on commercial drivers</title>

      <para>
	Various commercial drivers for sound, video, etc. exist for Linux.
	Tracking these commercial drivers is beyond the scope of this
	document.  These drivers might be mentioned at various points in
	this document, but note that no effort has been made to make sure
	that this information is current.

      <title>Known problems with this document</title>

      <para>
	This document can't possibly be up-to-date at all times.  I would
	like to see this document be a useful reference again.  The
	following items need to be fixed for that to happen:

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Old cruft needs to be eliminated.  Much of this document was
	      written in 1995, give or take, when PCI was new and not
	      supported terribly well, and ISA PnP was seen as something
	      evil.  Oh, how the times have changed...
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      Also, many of the model numbers listed in this document are
	      no longer available, and are probably not of much interest to
	      the vast majority of people.  Personally, I think hardware
	      that hasn't been available for more than 5 years or so can
	      safely be removed.  Old versions of this document will always
	      be available on the Internet...
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

          <listitem>
	    <para>
	      URLs in this document need updating.  I've begun to do that,
	      but it is a big job...  Diffs are welcome.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      In the process of updating and converting this document to
	      DocBook, some cruft was introduced.  If anyone wants to help
	      clean up this, get the latest source (preferably by emailing
	      me at <email>steve@silug.org</email>) and grep for "FIXME".
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Lists in this HOWTO that are available in other HOWTOs or
	      FAQs need to be either updated here or dropped completely
	      from this document.  (A good example is the list of video
	      cards supported by XFree86.)
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Newer interfaces such as USB need to be added into the list.
	      (Would a USB-attached hard drive go under "USB", "Removable
	      drives", "Hard drives", or all of the above?)
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      And, of course, random hardware that just isn't listed in

	use the help.  :-)

      <title>Acknowledgments</title>

      <para>
	This document has passed through many hands.  I don't know if he
	wrote the first version, but in 1993 Ed Carp was maintaining it.
	In August of 1994, FRiC (Boy of Destiny) took over.  After he fell
	off the face of the planet in late 1995 or early 1996 (and we all
	miss him from IRC, I might add), Patrick Reijnen took over
	(sometime in 1997) and continued to maintain this document until
	late 1999.
      </para>

      <para>
	Recent versions of this document contained the following:

	<blockquote>
	  <para>
            Thanks to all the authors and contributors of other HOWTO's,
            many things here are shamelessly stolen from their works; to
            FRiC, Zane Healy and Ed Carp, the original authors of this
            HOWTO; and to everyone else who sent in updates and feedbacks.
            Special thanks to Eric Boerner and lilo (the person, not the
            program) for the sanity checks. And thanks to Dan Quinlan for
            the original SGML conversion.
	  </para>

      <para>
	Many thanks to all those who have contributed to this document over
	the years.

	Group</ulink> and the <ulink url="http://www.luci.org/">Linux Users
	of Central Illinois</ulink> for giving me so many interesting

	putting up with me all these years.  :-)

  <sect1 id="motherboards">
    <title>Computers/Motherboards/BIOS</title>

    <para>
      ISA, VLB, EISA, PCI, and AGP buses are all supported.  All recent
      motherboards should work fine, although certain integrated
      controllers may or may not work well (or at all).

        PROCEDURE TO REPORT NEW PCI DEVICES
        We are trying to collect information on new PCI devices, using
        the standard PCI identification procedure. If some warning is
        displayed at boot time, please report 
         - /proc/pci
         - your exact hardware description. Try to find out
           which device is unknown. It may be you mainboard chipset.
           PCI-CPU bridge or PCI-ISA bridge.
         - If you can't find the actual information in your hardware
           booklet, try to read the references of the chip on the board.
         - Send all that to linux-pcisupport@cao-vlsi.ibp.fr,
           and I'll add your device to the list as soon as possible

       BEFORE you send a mail, please check the latest linux releases
       to be sure it has not been recently added.

           Thanks
                 Frederic Potter.

    <title>Memory</title>

    <para>
      All memory like DRAM, EDO and SDRAM can be used with Linux.  Be aware
      that older kernels or kernels running on a mortherboard with an older
      BIOS may only be able to detect 64MB of RAM.  If you have this
      problem, when you add more than 64 Mb of memory you have to add the
      following line to your LILO configuration file:

      <blockquote>
	<para>
          append="mem=&lt;number of Mb&gt;M"
	</para>
      </blockquote>

      So when you have 96 MB of memory this should become 

      <blockquote>
	<para>
          append="mem=96M"
	</para>
      </blockquote>

      Don't use a number higher than the amount of RAM you really have.
      This will cause crashes.

    <para>
      If you're looking into buying a cheap video card to run X, keep in mind
      that accelerated cards (ATI Mach, ET4000/W32p, S3) are MUCH faster than
      unaccelerated or partially accelerated (Cirrus, WD) cards.
    </para>

    <para>
      "32 bpp" is actually 24 bit color aligned on 32 bit boundaries.  It
      does NOT mean the cards are capable of 32 bit color, they still
      display 24 bit color (16,777,216 colors).  24 bit packed pixels modes
      are not supported in XFree86, so cards that can do 24 bit modes to
      get higher resolutions in other OS's are not able to do this in X
      using XFree86. These cards include Mach32, Cirrus 542x, S3
      801/805/868/968, ET4000, and others.

      It is important to pick a SCSI controller carefully.  Many cheap ISA
      SCSI controllers are designed to drive CD-ROM's rather than anything
      else.  Such low-end SCSI controllers are no better than IDE.  See the
      SCSI HOWTO and look at performance figures before buying a SCSI card.

      See National Semiconductor's ``Application Note AN-493'' by
      Martin S. Michael. Section 5.0 describes in detail the
      differences between the NS16550 and NS16550A. Briefly, the
      NS16550 had bugs in the FIFO circuits, but the NS16550A (and
      later) chips fixed those. However, there were very few NS16550's
      produced by National, long ago, so these should be very rare.
      And many of the ``16550'' parts in actual modern boards are from
      the many manufacturers of compatible parts, which may not use
      the National ``A'' suffix. Also, some multiport boards will use
      16552 or 16554 or various other multiport or multifunction chips
      from National or other suppliers (generally in a dense package
      soldered to the board, not a 40 pin DIP). Mostly, don't worry
      about it unless you encounter a very old 40 pin DIP National
      ``NS16550'' (no A) chip loose or in an old board, in which case
      treat it as a 16450 (no FIFO) rather than a 16550A. - Zhahai

          Non-intelligent cards usually come in two varieties, one
          using standard com port addresses and use 4 IRQ's, and
          another that's AST FourPort compatible and uses a selectable
          block of addresses and a single IRQ. (Addresses and IRQ's
          are set using <literal remap="tt">setserial</literal>.)
          If you're getting one of these cards, be sure to check
          which standard it conforms to, prices are no indication.

          Ethernet adapters vary greatly in performance. In general the
          newer the design the better. Some very old cards like the 3Com
          3c501 are only useful because they can be found in junk heaps
          for $5 a time. Be careful with clones, not all are good clones
          and bad clones often cause erratic lockups under Linux. Read the
          <ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Ethernet-HOWTO.html">

        OSS supports all MIDI daughter cards including Wave
        Blaster, TB Rio and Yamaha DB50XG. The only requirement is that
        the "host" card is supported by OSS. Note that only the "host"
        card needs to be configured using soundconf. The daughter card
        will be automatically accessible through the MIDI of the "host"
        card.

      <para>
        All CD-ROM drives should work similarly for reading data.
        There are various compatibility problems with audio CD playing
        utilities. (Especially with newer low-end NEC drives.) Some
        alpha drivers may not have audio support yet.
      </para>

      <para>
        Early (single speed) NEC CD-ROM drives may have trouble
        with currently available SCSI controllers.
      </para>

      <para>
        PhotoCD (XA) is supported. The hpcdtoppm program by Hadmut
        Danisch converts PhotoCD files to the portable pixmap format.
        The program can be obtained from 

        <ulink url="ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/hpcdtoppm">
        <!-- FIXME -->here</ulink>
        or as part of the PBM utilities.
      </para>

      <para>
        Also, reading video CD is supported in kernel series
        2.1.3x and later. A patch is available for kernel 2.0.30.
      </para>

      <para>
        Finally, most IDE CD-ROM Changers are supported.

      <para>
        Touchpad devices like Alps Glidepoint also work, so long
        they're compatible with another mouse protocol.
      </para>

      <para>
        Newer Logitech mice (except the Mouseman) use the
        Microsoft protocol and all three buttons do work. Eventhough
        Microsoft's mice have only two buttons, the protocol allows
        three buttons.
      </para>

      <para>
        The mouse port on the ATI Graphics Ultra and Ultra Pro use
        the Logitech busmouse protocol. (See the
	<ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Busmouse-HOWTO.html">
        Busmouse HOWTO</ulink> for details.)

    <title>Modems</title>

    <para>
      All external modems connected via a RS-232 serial port should work. 
      This includes external ISDN adapters, although some of the extended
      features of external ISDN adapaters (such as multilink) may or may
      not work.
    </para>

    <para>
      Internal modems are another story, however.  There are many so-called
      "winmodems" available now.  In fact, it seems that most PCI modems
      are winmodems.  Some of them do have drivers for Linux now, but many
      of the drivers are often binary-only.  (See the
      <link linkend="binary-only">note</link> on binary-only drivers.) See
      <ulink url="http://www.linmodems.org/">Linmodems.org</ulink> for more
      information on Linux-supported winmodems.
    </para>

    <para>
      Note that there are external USB winmodems on the market now, so be
      very careful when shopping for external modems.
    </para>

    <para>
      Furthermore, many flash upgradable modems only have
      flash programs for Win95/NT. These modems cannot be upgraded under
      Linux.
    </para>

    <para>
      A small number of modems come with DOS software that
      downloads the control program at runtime. These can normally be
      used by loading the program under DOS and doing a warm boot. Such
      modems are probably best avoided as you won't be able to use them
      with non PC hardware in the future.
    </para>

    <para>
      Most 16-bit PCMCIA modems should work with the PCMCIA drivers.
      CardBus modems are usually winmodems much like PCI modems.  Your best
      bet for now is to find a card that lists compatibility with DOS and
      Windows 3.1.
    </para>

    <para>
      All that said, if a modem is known to have a real UART (or hardware
      UART emulation), whether it is ISA, PCMCIA, etc., it should work
      under Linux.
    </para>

    <para>
      Fax modems need appropriated fax software to operate. Also
      be sure that the fax part of the modem supports Class 2 or Class
      2.0. It seems to be generally true for any fax software on unix
      that support for Class 1.0 is not available.
    </para>

    <para>
      An exception to this is the Linux efax program which
      supports both Class 1 and Class 2 fax modems. In some cases there
      can be a few (minor) technical problems with Class 1 modems. If
      you have a choice it is recommend to get a Class 2 modem.
    </para>

    <para>
      See Appendix E <link linkend="incompatible">Linux
      Incompatible Hardware</link> for specific cards known not to work with
      Linux.

    <title>Appendix B. Supported PCMCIA cards</title>

    <para>
      These cards are supported by David Hinds' PCMCIA package and
      this list is taken from his web page (<ulink
      url="http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/">
      <!-- FIXME -->here</ulink>).

    <para>
      CardBus cards are listed at the end of each section. At this
      time, all CardBus drivers should be treated as experimental.
      Beware that some cards have 16-bit and CardBus versions with very
      similar names. If the CardBus version is not specifically listed
      as supported here, then you should not expect it to work.

        Be careful. Many vendors, particularly CD-ROM vendors,
        seem to switch controller chips at will. Generally, They will
        use a different product code, but not always: older (supported)
        New Media Bus Toaster cards are not easily distinguishable from
        the current (unsupported) Bus Toaster cards.

      <para>
        These card drives are supported starting with kernel
        1.3.72. Both Flash-ATA cards and rotating-media cards are
        supported. The very old Western Digital 40MB drives are not
        supported, because they do not conform to the PCMCIA ATA
        specifications.

      More and more, the parallel port is used to connect other

      To be clear: printers are not presented in this appendix as

      For people having trouble getting Plug and Play devices to

      Quote from the README:
    </para>

    <para>
      These programs allow ISA Plug-And-Play devices to be
      configured on a Linux machine. This program is suitable for all

    <title>Appendix E. Linux incompatible Hardware</title>

    <para>
      Some hardware manufacturers have created devices which are
      compatible with MS-DOS and Windows 95/98 only. They seem to
      emulate part of the normally available hardware in the devices by
      software packages sold together with the device. Specification on
      these devices are not presented to the world so it is almost
      impossible to write drivers for these devices. Below a list of
      devices reported as being Linux incompatible will be given.

      Simply put, it is best to avoid hardware which states things
      like "Needs Windows" or "Windows only".

              AT Attachment Packet Interface. A new protocol for
              controlling mass storage devices similar to SCSI
              protocols. It builds on the ATA (AT Attachment) interface,
              the official ANSI Standard name for the IDE interface
              developed for hard disk drives. ATAPI is commonly used for
              hard disks, CD-ROM drives, tape drives, and other
              devices.

              Redudant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks. The basic idea of
              RAID is to combine multiple small, inexpensive disk
              drives into an array of disk drives which yields
              performance exceeding that of a single large expensive
              drive. There are five types of redundant array
              Architectures; RAID-1 through RAID-5. A non-redudant
              array of disk drives is referred to as RAID-0. Some RAID
              systems can mix formats.

              Printing Performance Architecture. Protocol
              developed by Hewlett Packard for their series of Deskjet
              printers. In essence, the protocol moves the low-level
              processing of the data to the host computer rather than
              the printer. This allows for a low-cost printer with a
              small amount of memory and computing power and a flexible
              driver. However, this comes at the price of compatibility.
              HP's decision was to develop drivers only for Windows 95
              for this printer.
