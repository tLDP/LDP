    <abstract>
      <para>Imagine your disk drive has just become a very expensive hockey puck. Imagine you have had a fire, and your computer case now looks like something Salvador Dal&itilde; would like to paint. Now what?</para>
      <para>Total restore, sometimes called bare metal recovery, is the process of rebuilding a computer after a catastrophic failure. In order to make a total restoration, you must have complete backups, not only of your file system, but of partition information and other data. This HOWTO is a step-by-step tutorial on how to back up a Linux computer so as to be able to make a bare metal recovery, and how to make that bare metal recovery. It includes some related scripts.</para>
    </abstract>
  </articleinfo>

  <sect1 id="intro">
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>The normal bare metal restoration process is: install the operating system from the product disks. Install the backup software, so you can restore your data. Restore your data. Then you get to restore functionality by verifying your configuration files, permissions, etc.</para>
    <para>
   The process and scripts explained in this HOWTO will save re-installing the operating system. The process explained here will restore only files that were backed up from the production computer. Your configuration will be intact when you restore the system, which should save you hours of verifying configurations and data.</para>

  <sect1 id="Overview">
    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>The process shown below is not easy, and can be hazardous to your data. Practice it before you need it! Do as I did, and <emphasis>practice on a sacrificial computer</emphasis>!</para>
    <para>The original target computer for this HOWTO was a Pentium computer. Originally, it had a <ulink url="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</ulink> 7.1 Linux server or workstation installation on one IDE hard drive. Since then, I have used a number of computers, and they have been ugraded to Red Hat 8.0 and <ulink url="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora Cores 1, 3 and 4.</ulink>. The target computer does not have vast amounts of data because the computer was set up as a <quote>sacrificial</quote> test bed. That is, I did not want to test this process with a production computer and production data. Also, I did a fresh installation before I started the testing so that I could always re-install if I needed to revert to a known configuration.</para>
    <note>
      <title>NOTE</title><para>The sample commands will show, in most cases, what I had to type to recover the target system. You may have to use similar commands, but with different parameters. It is up to you to be sure you duplicate your setup, and not the test computer's setup.</para>
    </note>
    <para>The basic procedure is set out in W. Curtis Preston, <ulink url="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/unixbr/"><citetitle pubwork="book">Unix Backup &amp; Recovery</citetitle></ulink>, O'Reilly &amp; Associates, 1999, which I have favorably reviewed in <ulink url="http://www2.linuxjournal.com/lj-issues/issue78/3839.html"><citetitle pubwork="journal">Linux Journal</citetitle></ulink>. However, the book is a bit thin on specific, real-time questions. For example, exactly which files do you back up? What metadata should you preserve, and how? This document explores those questions.</para>
    <para>Before beginning the process set forth in this HOWTO you will need to back up your system with a typical backup tool such as Amanda, <trademark class="trade">BRU</trademark>, tar, <trademark class="registered">Arkeia</trademark> or cpio. The question, then, is how to get from toasted hardware to the point where you can run the restoration tool that will restore your data.</para>
    <para>Users of Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) based Linux distributions should also save RPM metadata as part of their normal backups. The following is in one of the scripts in this HOWTO:</para>
    <programlisting>bash# <command>rpm -Va | sort +2 -t ' ' | uniq > /etc/rpmVa.txt</command></programlisting>
    <para>It provides a basis for comparison after a bare metal restoration.</para>
    <para>To get to this point, you must have:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Your hardware up and running again, with replacement components as needed. The BIOS should be correctly configured, including time and date, and hard drive parameters. At the moment, there is no provision for using a different hard drive.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
		<para>When I started this project, I used a <ulink url="http://www.iomega.com/zip/products/par100_250.html"><trademark class="registered">ZIP</trademark> drive</ulink>. Now, they are rather cramped for space and can be inconvenient. You can substitute a USB flash disk, NFS mount, CD-RW or other medium. Just be sure that the Linux distribution you use for first stage restore supports your medium. For historical reasons, this document will refer to the <ulink url="http://www.iomega.com/zip/products/par100_250.html"><trademark class="registered">ZIP</trademark> drive</ulink>; please substitute the medium of your choice. There is more discussion of alternatives below in the section on <link linkend="themeandvariations">Theme And Variations</link>.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Your normal backup media: tape hard drive, etc.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>A minimal Linux system that will allow you to run the restoration software, which we will call the restoration Linux.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>To get there, you need at least two stages of backup, and possibly three. Exactly what you back up and in which stage you back it up is determined by your restoration process. For example, if you are restoring a tape server, you may not need networking during the restoration process. So only back up networking in your regular backups.</para>
    <para>You will restore in stages as well. In stage one, we build partitions, file systems, etc. and restore a minimum of files from the ZIP disk. The goal of stage one is to be able to boot to a running computer with a network connection, tape drives, restoration software, or whatever we need for stage two.</para>
    <para>The second stage, if it is necessary, consists of restoring backup software and any relevant databases. For example, suppose you use Arkeia and you are building a bare metal recovery ZIP disk for your backup server. Arkeia keeps a huge database on the server's hard drives. You can recover the database from the tapes, if you want. Instead, why not tar and gzip the whole arkeia directory (at /usr/knox), and save that to another computer over NFS or SSH? Stage one, as we have defined it below, does not include X, so you will have some experimenting to do if you wish to back up X as well as your backup program. Some restore programs require X.</para>
    <para>Of course, if you are using some other backup program, you may have some detective work to do to. You will have to find out the directories and files it needs to run. If you use tar, gzip, cpio, mt or dd for your backup and recovery tools, they will be saved to and restored from our ZIP disk as part of the stage one process describe below.</para>
    <para>The last stage is a total restoration from tape or other media. After you have done that last stage, you should be able to boot to a fully restored and operational system.</para>
    <sect2 id="limitations">
      <title>Limitations</title>
      <para>This HOWTO is restricted to making a minimal backup such that, having then restored that backup to new hardware (<quote>bare metal</quote>), you can then use your regular backups to restore a completely working system. This HOWTO does not deal with your regular backups at all.</para>
      <para>Even within that narrow brief, this HOWTO is not exhaustive. You still have some research, script editing, and testing to do.</para>
      <para>The scripts here restore the partition data exactly as found on the source hard drive. This is nice if you are restoring on an identical computer or at least an identical hard drive, but that is often not the case. For now, there are two remedies (which will make more sense after you've read the rest of the HOWTO):</para>
      <itemizedlist>

    <para>Build yourself a restoration Linux disk. I have used <ulink url="http://www.knoppix.org/">Knoppix</ulink>. See the notes on <link linkend="knoppix">Knoppix</link> below. However, everything here is command line. We don't need a GUI. A GUI-less distribution will boot faster and can load itself into memory (so you can use the CD drive) even on a minimal machine. For this I now use <ulink url="http://www.finnix.org/">Finnix</ulink>.</para>
    <para>In the past, I have used <ulink url="http://www.toms.net/rb">tomsrtbt</ulink>. It is well documented and packs a lot of useful tools onto one floppy diskette. Unfortunately, the changes I've had to make in the scripts to handle more recent Linux systems cause problems for <ulink url="http://www.toms.net/rb">tomsrtbt</ulink>. The <ulink url="http://www.toms.net/rb">tomsrtbt</ulink> 2.0.103 tar is based on <ulink url="http://www.busybox.net/">busybox</ulink>, so remarks about it may apply to other Linux disties which use busybox.</para>
    <para>Next, figure out how to do the operating system backup you will need so that you can restore your normal backup. I used to follow Preston's advice and use an Iomega parallel port ZIP drive. The drives get approximately 90 MB of useful storage to a disk. I need about 85 MB to back up my desktop, so a 100MB ZIP drive may be pushing your luck. These days I use CD-RWs or NFS. For more on those, see the sections on using <link linkend="cd-rom">CD-ROM</link>s and <link linkend="nfs">NFS</link>.</para>

      <title>Backup Server</title>
      <para>You can set up a backup server for this process. Scripts on the backup server interact with the target machines (including itself) via SSH. They assume that your backup server user (root here, for simplicity) can log in with no password to the targets. This is necessary for unattended backups.</para>
      <para>First, create a suitable directory to keep all the backups in. We'll call it <filename>backs</filename>. In backs, create a directory for each target computer. The first field in the directory should be the host name. Subsequent fields can be other useful information. For example, to preserve the last backup of a target before an installation of a new version of the distribution, I use an abbreviation for the distribution, e.g. <quote>fc5</quote>. Fields are separated with periods (<quote>.</quote>). So, for example, <filename>tester.f7</filename>. The host name is required because the scripts use that to determine which host to back up.</para>
      <para>Copy the scripts <filename>get</filename> and <filename>restore</filename> into each target's directory. Then customize them for each host as needed.</para>
      <para>Also create in <filename>backs</filename> a directory called <filename>scripts</filename> and put in it the script <filename>get.target</filename>. This is a library for the backup and restore scripts. It performs actions common to all backups and restorations.</para>

    <title>Creating the Stage 1 Back Up</title>
    <para>Having made your production backups, you need to preserve your partition information so that you can rebuild your partitions.</para>
    <para>The script <link linkend="make.fdisk"><filename>make.fdisk</filename></link> scans a hard drive for partition information, and saves it in four files. The first is an executable script, called <link linkend="make.dev.hda"><filename>make.dev.x</filename></link> (where <quote>x</quote> is the name of the device file, e.g. hda). Second is <link linkend="mount.dev.hda"><filename>mount.dev.x</filename></link>, which creates mount points and mounts the newly created partitions on them. The next, <link linkend="dev.hda"><filename>dev.x</filename></link>, is the commands necessary for <command>fdisk</command> to build the partitions. Last is an input file for <command>sfdisk</command> to create partions. (<command>sfdisk</command> is preferable and used if found.) You specify which hard drive you want to build scripts for (and thus the file names) by naming the associated device file as the argument to <link linkend="make.fdisk"><filename>make.fdisk</filename></link>. For example, on a typical IDE system,</para>
    <programlisting>bash# <command>make.fdisk /dev/hda</command></programlisting>
    <para>spits out the scripts <link linkend="make.dev.hda"><filename>make.dev.hda</filename></link>, <link linkend="mount.dev.hda"><filename>mount.dev.hda</filename></link> and the input files for <command>fdisk</command> and <command>sfdisk</command>, <link linkend="dev.hda"><filename>dev.hda</filename></link> and <link linkend="dev.hda.sfd"><filename>dev.hda.sfd</filename></link>, respectively.</para>
    <para>In addition, if <link linkend="make.fdisk"><filename>make.fdisk</filename></link> encounters a FAT partition, it preserves the partition's boot sector in a file named <filename>dev.xy</filename>, where x is the drive's device name (e.g. sdc, hda) and y is the partition number. The boot sector is the first sector, 512 bytes, of the partition. This sector is restored at the same time the partitions are rebuilt, in the script <link linkend="make.dev.hda"><filename>make.dev.hda</filename></link>.</para>
    <para>Fortunately, the price of hard drives is plummeting almost as fast as the public's trust in politicians after an election. So it is good that the output files are text, and allow hand editing. That's the most difficult but most flexible way to rebuild on a larger replacement drive. (See the <link linkend="todo">To Do list</link>.)</para>
    <para>Other metadata are preserved by the script <link linkend="save.metadata"><filename>save.metadata</filename></link>. The script saves the partition information in the file <filename>fdisk.hda</filename> in the root of the ZIP disk. It is a good idea to print this file and your <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> so that you have hard copy should you ever have to restore the partition data manually. You can save a tree by toggling between two virtual consoles, running <command>fdisk</command> in one and catting <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> or <filename>/fdisk.hda</filename> as needed. However, doing so is error prone.</para>
    <para>You will also want to preserve files relevant to your restoration method. For example, if you use NFS to save your data, you will need to preserve hosts.allow, hosts.deny, exports, etc. Also, if you are using any network-backed restoration process, such as Amanda or Quick Restore, you will need to preserve networking files like HOSTNAME, hosts, etc. and the relevant software tree.</para>
    <para>The simplest way to handle these and similar questions is to preserve the entire <filename>/etc</filename> directory.</para>
    <para>There is no way a 100 MB ZIP drive is going to hold a server installation of a modern distribution of Linux. We have to be much more selective than simply preserving the whole kazoo. What files do we need?</para>

    <para>We may require several iterations of back up, test the bare metal restore, re-install from CD and try again, before we have a working backup script.

    <para>One thing you can do on an RPM based system is use the <command>rpm</command> program to determine which files are where. For example, to get a complete list of the files used by the openssh package, run:</para>

      <title>WARNING</title>
      <para>Recent kernels have incorporated a new ATA (IDE) hard drive driver, libata. Because of this, parallel ATA drives (PATA) now show up as SCSI drives, as serial ATA (SATA) have always done. However, not all rescue distributions (e.g. finix) use this new driver. There is a line toward the bottom of <link linkend="save.metadata"><filename>save.metadata</filename></link> wich very carefully replaces "/dev/sda" with "/dev/hda". Use this as a template if you have multiple IDE hard drives. Comment it out or delete it if this is not an issue for you.</para>
      <para>Note that there is no guaranteed mapping! Systems with multiple hard drives may have confusing mappings. Be sure to edit this line carefully. Check it if you add or remove a hard drive of any interface type to or from your system!</para>
      <para>N.B: if you have libata IDE drive issues, the grub-install line at the end of <link linkend="restore.metadata"><filename>restore.metadata</filename></link> won't work. If it doesn't, use your rescue disk to do the same. Or burn and boot to the boot image that is made as part of the first stage backup. Boot to it and do the second state restore as usual. The second state restore should re-run <filename>grub-install</filename> or you can run it manually.</para>

        <title>No ZIP drive</title>
        <para>This backup process used to require you to have the ZIP disk drive present at each backup. It now creates the archive in a directory, which you can back up over the net. Then you only need to build a ZIP disk (with <command>cp -rp</command>) on the backup server when you need to restore.</para>
        <para>The backup process will be faster than directly writing to the ZIP drive, but you should check that the resulting directory will fit on your ZIP disk (with the output of <command>du -hs $target.zip</command> in the script <link linkend="save.metadata"><filename>save.metadata</filename></link>)! See the definition of the variable <varname>zip</varname> in that script.</para>
        <para>One of my laptops has problems running both a network card and a ZIP drive, so this is the process I use to back it up. I keep a backup image as well as the current one, so that I have a fallback in case the computer crashes during a backup.</para>

        <title id="cd-rom">CD-ROM</title>
        <para>This is similar to the no ZIP drive option above. Save your backups to a directory on your hard drive, as noted. Then use <command>mkisofs</command> to create an ISO 9660 image from that directory, and burn it. This does not work with some CD-ROM based restoration Linuxes, like <ulink url="http://www.knoppix.org/">Knoppix</ulink>, because the Linux has to have the CD-ROM drive. Unless you have two CD-ROM drives, say one in a USB clamshell. I have a DVD burner set up this way with exactly this in mind. Or have <ulink url="http://www.finnix.org/">Finnix</ulink> load itself into memory on boot and then use the CD-ROM drive from which you booted.</para>
        <para>These remarks should also apply to DVDs.</para>
        <para>Also, look at <ulink url="http://www.knoppix.net/wiki/Knoppix_Remastering_Howto">remastering</ulink> Knoppix with your first and second stage backups on the CD-ROM. You should also be able to <ulink url="http://www.finnix.org/Remastering_Finnix">remaster Finnix</ulink>.</para>
        <para>These days many computers come with a CD-ROM drive but no floppy diskette. And floppy drives do fail. So it's a good idea to burn your CD-ROM with a bootable image on it. The bad news is that the <quote>El Torito</quote> format supports 1.2 MB, 1.44 MB and 2.88 MB floppy images, and <ulink url="http://www.toms.net/rb">tomsrtbt</ulink> uses a 1.7 MB floppy. The good news is that you can get a 2.88 MB version, <filename>tomsrtbt-2.0.103.ElTorito.288.img</filename>, from the same mirrors where you get the floppy image. Place a <emphasis>copy</emphasis>
<footnote>
            <para>I emphasize copy because <command>mkisofs</command> will mung the file in the directory from which it makes the ISO image.</para>
          </footnote>
 in the root directory of the backup files. Then use the <command>mkisofs</command> command line option -b to specify <filename>tomsrtbt-2.0.103.ElTorito.288.img</filename> as the boot image file.</para>
        <para>The only down side of this process is that many older BIOSes do not support 2.88 MB floppy images on CD-ROMs. Most of those will boot to a <ulink url="http://www.toms.net/rb">tomsrtbt</ulink> floppy.</para>
        <para>An alternative is to use <ulink url="http://syslinux.zytor.com/">Syslinux</ulink>. It is not dependent on a floppy diskette image, and you can build your own CD with a number of tools, such as <ulink url="http://www.toms.net/rb">tomsrtbt</ulink>, on it.</para>
        <para>You may have to adjust the BIOS options to allow the computer to boot to CD-ROM drive. If you can't do that, either because the BIOS won't support booting to CD-ROM, or because you can't get into the BIOS, see <ulink url="http://btmgr.webframe.org/">Smart Boot Manager (SBM)</ulink> as described in the <link linkend="resources">Resources</link>.</para>
        <para>One variant is to dispense with the tarballs in the first stage, and create a tarball of the entire system. When you build your restoration CD, put the monster tarball in the data directory of the CD. The scripts will pick that up and restore for you, combining the first and second stages. This eliminates a lot of the cruft related to permissions and ownership in <link linkend="restore.metadata"><filename>restore.metadata</filename></link> and <link linkend="save.metadata"><filename>save.metadata</filename></link></para>
        <para><emphasis>Test</emphasis> your CDs on the drive you will use at restoration time. If you find you need to hack the scripts, you can copy them to <filename>/tmp</filename>, usually a RAM drive, and edit them there. The scripts will run there.

        <para>There are time when you need to squeeze a few megabytes from the first stage data, especially when you are pushing the limit of your ZIP disk. The function <command>crunch</command> in the script <link linkend="save.metadata"><filename>save.metadata</filename></link> takes multiple parameters to feed to <command>tar</command>. It can also take the <command>--exclude</command> parameter. So, for example, you can exclude the <filename>samba</filename> and <filename>X11</filename> directories under <filename>/etc</filename> like so:</para>
        <programlisting><![ CDATA [crunch etc --exclude etc/samba --exclude etc/X11 etc]]></programlisting>
        <para>Why those two? Because they're hard drive space hogs and we don't need them when booting after the first stage.</para>
        <para>If you keep multiple kernels around, you can eliminate the modules for all of the kernels you won't boot to. Check your <filename>lilo.conf</filename> or <filename>/boot/grub/menu.lst</filename> to see which kernel you will use, and then check <filename>/lib/modules</filename> for module directories you can exclude.</para>
        <para>How to find more good candidates for exclusion? List the target directories with <command>ls -alSr</command> for individual files, and <command>du | sort -n</command> for directories.</para>
        <para>Another (probably neater) way to exclude directories is to put a complete list of directories into a file, then refer to it via the tar option <filename>--exclude-from=FILENAME</filename>.</para>

For example, you should always run these scripts as root even if some other user gives you the requisite privileges.</para>
      <para>Once the restoration Linux has booted and you have a console, mount the ZIP drive. It is probably a good idea to mount it read only. On <ulink url="http://www.toms.net/rb">tomsrtbt</ulink>:</para>
      <programlisting># <command>mount /dev/sda1 /mnt -o ro</command></programlisting>
      <para>Check to be sure it is there:</para>
      <programlisting># <command>ls -l /mnt</command></programlisting>
      <para>On <ulink url="http://www.knoppix.org/">Knoppix</ulink> or <ulink url="http://www.finnix.org/">Finnix</ulink>, you may want to make a directory under <filename>/mnt</filename> and mount it there, like so:</para>
      <programlisting># <command>mkdir /mnt/zip</command>
# <command>mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/zip -o ro</command></programlisting>
      <para>Now cd into the mounted device, and into the <filename>bin</filename> directory below it. On <ulink url="http://www.finnix.org/">Finnix</ulink>, for example:</para>
      <programlisting># <command>cd /mnt/zip/bin</command></programlisting>
      <para>The scripts assume you are in this directory, and call data files relative to it. At this point, you can run the restoration automatically or manually. Use the automated restore if you don't need to make any changes as you go along.</para>
      <para>One consideration here is whether you have multiple hard drives. If your Linux installation mounts partitions on multiple hard drives, you must mount the root partition first. This is to ensure that mount point directories are created on the partition where they belong. The script <link linkend="first.stage">first.stage</link> will run the scripts to mount the drives in the order in which they are created. If you have created them (in the script <filename>save.metadata</filename>) in the order in which they cascade from root, the mounting process should work just fine.</para>
      <para>If you have multiple hard drives, and they cross-mount, you are on your own. Either combine and edit the scripts to mount them in the correct order, or do it manually.</para>
      <sect3>
        <title>Automated</title>
        <para>The automatic process calls each of the manual scripts in proper order. It does not allow for manual intervention, say for creating file systems that this HOWTO does not support. To run the first stage restore automatically, enter the command:</para>
        <programlisting># <command>first.stage</command></programlisting>

        <para>Now is a good time to check the geometry of the drive.

To force it to be correct on <ulink url="http://www.knoppix.org/">Knoppix</ulink>, edit <link linkend="make.dev.hda"><filename>make.dev.x</filename></link>.

    <note>
      <title>NOTE</title>
      <para>When you restore, read the documentation for your restoration programs carefully. For example, tar does not normally restore certain characteristics of files, like suid bits. File permissions are set by the user's umask. To restore your files exactly as you saved them, use tar's p option. Similarly, make sure your restoration software will restore everything exactly as you saved it.</para>
    </note>
    <para>To restore the test computer:</para>
    <programlisting>bash# <command>restore.all</command></programlisting>
    <para>If you used tar for your backup and restoration, and used the -k (keep old files, don't overwrite) option, you will see a lot of this:</para>
    <screen><![ CDATA [tar: usr/sbin/rpcinfo: Could not create file: File exists
]]><![ CDATA [tar: usr/sbin/zdump: Could not create file: File exists
]]><![ CDATA [tar: usr/sbin/zic: Could not create file: File exists
]]><![ CDATA [tar: usr/sbin/ab: Could not create file: File exists]]></screen>
    <para>This is normal, as tar is refusing to overwrite files you restored during the first stage of restoration.</para>
    <para>Then reboot. On the way down, you will see a lot of error messages, such as <quote>no such pid.</quote> This is a normal part of the process. The shutdown code is using the pid files from daemons that were running when the backup was made to shut down daemons that were not started on the last boot. Of course there's no such pid.</para>
    <para>Your system should come up normally, with a lot fewer errors than it had before; ideally no errors. The acid test of how well your restore works on an RPM based system is to verify all packages. During the first stage backup, a verification was performed on the system, producing the file <filename>rpmVa.txt</filename>. Verify your system again, and compare the results to the one made earlier. E.g.:</para>
    <programlisting>bash# <command>rpm -Va | sort +2 -t ' ' | uniq > ~/foo.txt
diff /mnt/zip/metadata/rpmVa.txt ~/foo.txt</command></programlisting>
    <para>Prelinking error messages are normal and you can ignore them. Do not first run the command <command>/etc/cron.daily/prelink</command> to remove them. Doing so may introduce new errors in the verification results that will skew your results.</para>
    <para>Some files, such as configuration and log files, will have changed in the normal course of things, and you should be able to mentally filter those out of the report. Emacs users should check out its ediff facilities.</para>
    <para>Now you should be up and running. It is time to test your applications, especially those that run as daemons. The more sophisticated the application, the more testing you may need to do. If you have remote users, disable them from using the system, or make it <quote>read only</quote> while you test it. This is especially important for databases, to prevent making any corruption or data loss worse than it already might be.</para>
    <para>If you normally boot to X, it was disabled as part of the first stage restoration. Test X before you re-enable it. Re-enable it by changing that one line in <filename>/etc/inittab</filename>. Find the line that looks like this:</para>
    <programlisting><![ CDATA [id:3:initdefault:]]></programlisting>
    <para>and change it to this:</para>
    <programlisting><![ CDATA [id:5:initdefault:]]></programlisting>
    <para>Or just run this on the target to change it back. Note: different distributions use different run level schemes. These values work on Red Hat derived distributions; they may not on others.</para>
    <programlisting>sed -i s/id:.:initdefault:/id:5:initdefault:/g /etc/inittab</programlisting>

      <blockquote>
        <para>For me the best thing about using Knoppix is that I don't need a specific boot medium for each machine, but I can use the same tools all the time. And hardware support in Knoppix is really great. I don't have that much experience with different platforms, but all the machines I've tried have worked fine, scsi drivers are found and so on.</para>
        <para>I'm doing this recovery thing by copying the backups over the network to other machine. The restore involves booting the Knoppix cd, fetching the metadata.tar.gz from the network machine. Then make.dev, mount.dev, fetching the other tar.gz files, grub and reboot. Some typing involved but thanks to your scripts it's quite straighforward. Unless changing from ide to scsi or something, but even then it's not that difficult, since Linux is easy to restore to different hardware.</para>
      </blockquote>
      <para>Let me add to that that <ulink url="http://www.knoppix.org/">Knoppix</ulink> detects USB devices for you, which is really nice. They make excellent (and roomier) substitutes for the ZIP drive.</para>

Also, for <ulink url="http://www.knoppix.org/">Knoppix</ulink>, we tar the first stage stuff saving numeric user &amp; group values instead of by name.

    <sect2 id="Arkeia">
      <title>Arkeia</title>
      <para>These notes are based on testing with Arkeia 4.2.</para>
      <para><ulink url="http://www.arkeia.com/">Arkeia</ulink> is a backup and restore program that runs on a wide variety of platforms. You can use Arkeia as part of a bare metal restoration scheme, but there are two caveats.</para>
      <para>The first is probably the most problematic, as absent any more elegant solution you have to hand select the directories to restore in the navigator at restoration time. The reason is that, apparently, Arkeia has no mechanism for not restoring files already present on the disk, nothing analogous to <command>tar</command>'s -p option. If you simply allow a full restore, the restore will crash as Arkeia over-writes a library which is in use at restore time, e.g. <filename>lib/libc-2.1.1.so</filename>. Hand selection of directories to restore is at best dicey, so I recommend against it.</para>

      <para>The second caveat is that you have to back up the Arkeia data dictionary and/or programs. To do that, modify the <filename>save.metatdata</filename> script by adding Arkeia to the list of directories to save:</para>
      <programlisting><![ CDATA [# arkeia specific:
tar cf - usr/knox | gzip -c > $zip/arkeia.tar.gz]]></programlisting>
      <para>You <emphasis>must</emphasis> back up the data dictionary this way because Arkeia does not back up the data dictionary. This is one of my complaints about Arkeia, and I have solved it in the past by saving the data dictionary to tape with <ulink url="http://www.estinc.com/">The TOLIS Group's BRU</ulink>.</para> <!-- bad host name: 2003 07 25 -->

      <para><ulink url="http://www.amanda.org/">Amanda</ulink> (The Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver) works quite well with this set of scripts. Use the normal Amanda back-up process, and build your first stage data as usual. Amanda stores the data on tape in GNU tar or cpio format, and you can recover from individual files to entire backup images. The nice thing about recovering entire images is that you can then use variants on the scripts in this HOWTO to restore from the images, or direct from tape. I was able to restore my test machine with the directions from W. Curtis Preston's <ulink url="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/unixbr/"><citetitle pubwork="book">Unix Backup &amp; Recovery</citetitle></ulink>. For more information on it, see the <link linkend="resources">Resources</link>. The Amanda chapter from the book is <ulink url="http://www.backupcentral.com/amanda.html">on line</ulink>.</para>
      <para>I made two changes to the script <link linkend="restore"><filename>restore</filename></link>. First, I changed it to accept a file name as an argument. Then, since Amanda's <command>amrestore</command> decompresses the data as it restores it, I rewrote it to cat the file into the pipe instead of decompressing it.</para>
      <para>The resulting line looks like this:</para>
      <programlisting>cat $file | ssh $target "umask 000 ; cd / ; tar -xpkf - "
</programlisting>
      <para>where <command>$file</command> is the script's argument, the image recovered from the tape by <command>amrestore</command>.</para>
      <para>Since the command line arguments to <command>tar</command> prohibit over-writing, restore from images in the <emphasis>reverse</emphasis> of the order in which they were made. Restore most recent first.</para>
      <para>Amanda does require setting ownership by hand if you back up the amanda data directory with <link linkend="save.metadata"><filename>save.metadata</filename></link>. Something like:</para>

          <para>Recent kernels have incorporated a new ATA (IDE) hard drive driver, libata. Because of this, parallel ATA (PATA) drives now show up as SCSI drives, as serial ATA (SATA) have always done. However, not all rescue distributions (e.g. Finnix) use this new driver. There is a line toward the bottom of <link linkend="save.metadata"><filename>save.metadata</filename></link> wich very carefully replaces "/dev/sda" with "/dev/hda". Use this as a template if you have multiple IDE hard drives. Comment it out or delete it if this is not an issue for you.</para>
          <para>Note that there is no guaranteed mapping! Systems with multiple hard drives may have confusing mappings. Be sure to edit this line carefully. Check it if you add or remove a hard drive of any interface type to or from your system!</para>

Among the techniques Frisbee uses are an appropriately-adapted method of filesystem-aware compression, a custom application-level reliable multicast protocol, and flexible application-level framing. This design results in a system which can rapidly and reliably distribute a disk image to many clients simultaneously. For example, Frisbee can write a total of 50 gigabytes of data to 80 disks in 34 seconds on commodity PC hardware.

      <para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>

      <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only.</para>

      <para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</para>

      <title>VERBATIM COPYING</title>

      <para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</para>

      <para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.</para>

      <title>COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>

      <para>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.</para>

      <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</para>

      <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.</para>

      <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</para>

      <para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</para>

      <para>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</para>

      <para>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.</para>

      <para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy.

Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</para>

      <para>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".
