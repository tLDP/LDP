<Title>Introduction</Title>

<Para>
More and more, Linux machines are installed as part of a network of
computers. To simplify network administration, most networks (mostly
Sun-based networks) run the Network Information Service. Linux machines
can take full advantage of existing NIS service or provide NIS service
themselves. Linux machines can also act as full NIS+ clients, this
support is in beta stage.

This document tries to answer questions about setting up NIS(YP) and NIS+
on your Linux machine. Don't forget to read

<Para>
The choice between "traditional NIS" or the NIS code in the NYS library
is a choice between laziness and maturity vs. flexibility and love of
adventure.
</Para>

<Para>
The "traditional NIS" code is in the standard C library and has been
around longer and sometimes suffers from its age and slight
inflexibility.
</Para>

<Para>
The NIS code in the NYS library requires you to recompile the libc
library to include the NYS code into it (or maybe you can
get a precompiled version of libc from someone who has already done it).
</Para>

<Para>
Another difference is that the traditional NIS code has some support
for NIS Netgroups, which the NYS code doesn't. On the other hand
the NYS code allows you to handle Shadow Passwords in a transparent
way. The "traditonal NIS" code doesn't support Shadow Passwords over NIS.

<Para>
Forgot all this if you use the new GNU C Library 2.x (aka libc6). It
has real NSS (name switch service) support, which makes it very flexible,
and contains support for the following NIS/NIS+ maps: aliases, ethers, group,
hosts, netgroups, networks, protocols, publickey, passwd, rpc, services
and shadow. The GNU C Library has no problems with shadow passwords over NIS.
</Para>

<Sect2>
<Title>NIS or NIS+ ?
<IndexTerm><Primary
>NIS vs. NIS+</Primary></IndexTerm>
</Title>

<Para>
The choice between NIS and NIS+ is easy - use NIS+ only if you have
severe security needs. NIS+ is much more problematic to administer
(it's pretty easy to handle on the client side, but the server side
is horrible). Another problem is that the support for NIS+ under Linux
contains a lot of bugs and that the development has stopped.

<Title>How it works</Title>

<Sect2>
<Title>How NIS works
<IndexTerm><Primary
>NIS/YP, theory of operation</Primary></IndexTerm>
</Title>

<Para>
Within a network there must be at least one machine acting as a NIS
server. You can have multiple NIS servers, each serving different NIS
"domains" - or you can have cooperating NIS servers, where one is the
master NIS server, and all the other are so-called slave NIS servers
(for a certain NIS "domain", that is!) - or you can have a mix
of them...
</Para>

<Para>
Slave servers only have copies of the NIS databases and receive these
copies from the master NIS server whenever changes are made to the
master's databases.  Depending on the number of machines in your
network and the reliability of your network, you might decide to
install one or more slave servers.  Whenever a NIS server goes down or
is too slow in responding to requests, a NIS client connected to that
server will try to find one that is up or faster.
</Para>

<Para>
NIS databases are in so-called DBM format, derived from ASCII
databases.  For example, the files <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> and
<filename>/etc/group</filename> can be directly converted to DBM format
using ASCII-to-DBM translation software (<Command>makedbm</Command>,
included with the server software). The master NIS server should have
both, the ASCII databases and the DBM databases.
</Para>

<Para>
Slave servers  will be notified of any change to the NIS maps, (via the
<Command>yppush</Command> program), and automatically retrieve the
necessary changes in order to synchronize their databases. NIS clients
do not need to do this since they always talk to the NIS server to read
the information stored in it's DBM databases.
</Para>

<Para>
Old ypbind versions do a broadcast to find a running NIS server.
This is insecure, due the fact that anyone may install a NIS server
and answer the broadcast queries. Newer Versions of ypbind
(ypbind-3.3 or ypbind-mt) are able to get the server from a
configuration file - thus no need to broadcast.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>How NIS+ works
<IndexTerm><Primary
>NIS+!theory of operation</Primary></IndexTerm>
</Title>

<Para>
NIS+ is a new version of the network information nameservice from Sun.
The biggest difference between NIS and NIS+ is that NIS+ has
support for data encryption and authentication over secure RPC.
</Para>

<Para>
The  naming  model of NIS+ is based upon a tree structure. Each node in
the tree corresponds to an NIS+ object, from which we have six types:
directory, entry, group, link, table and private.
</Para>

<Para>
The NIS+ directory that forms the root of the NIS+ namespace is called
the root directory. There are two special NIS+ directories:
org_dir and groups_dir. The org_dir directory consists of all
administration tables, such as passwd, hosts, and mail_aliases. The
groups_dir directory consists of NIS+ group objects which are used for
access control. The collection of org_dir, groups_dir and their parent
directory is referred to as an NIS+ domain.

<Para>
To run any of the software mentioned below you will need to run the
program /sbin/portmap. Some Linux distributions already have
the code in the /sbin/init.d/ or /etc/rc.d/ files to start up this
daemon. All you have to do is to activate it and reboot your Linux
machine. Read your Linux Distribution Documentation how to do this.
</Para>

<Para>
The RPC portmapper (portmap(8)) is a server that converts RPC program
numbers into TCP/IP (or UDP/IP) protocol port numbers. It must be
running in order to make RPC calls (which is what the NIS/NIS+ client
software does) to RPC servers (like a NIS or NIS+ server) on that machine.
When an RPC server is started, it will tell portmap what port number it
is listening to, and what RPC program numbers it is prepared to serve.
When a client wishes to make an RPC call to a given program number, it
will first contact portmap on the server machine to determine the port
number where RPC packets should be sent.
</Para>

<Para>
Since RPC servers could be started by inetd(8), portmap should
be running before inetd is started.
</Para>

<Para>
For secure RPC, the portmapper needs the Time service. Make sure, that the
Time service is enabled in /etc/inetd.conf on all hosts:

<Screen>
#
# Time service is used for clock syncronization.

IMPORTANT: Don't forget to restart inetd after changes on its
configuration file !

To answer this question you have to consider two cases:
</Para>

<Para>

<OrderedList>
<ListItem>

<Para>
Your machine is going to be part of a network with existing NIS servers
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
You do not have any NIS servers in the network yet
</Para>
</ListItem>

</OrderedList>

</Para>

<Para>
In the first case, you only need the client programs (ypbind, ypwhich,
ypcat, yppoll, ypmatch). The most important program is ypbind. This
program must be running at all times, which means, it should always appear
in the list of processes. It is a daemon process and needs to
be started from the system's startup file (eg. /etc/init.d/nis,
/sbin/init.d/ypclient, /etc/rc.d/init.d/ypbind, /etc/rc.local).
As soon as ypbind is running your system has become a NIS client.
</Para>

<Para>
In the second case, if you don't have NIS servers, then you will also
need a NIS server program (usually called ypserv). <XRef LinkEnd="ypserv">
describes how to set up a NIS server on your Linux machine using the
<Command>ypserv</Command>
daemon.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>The Software
<IndexTerm><Primary
>NIS!library requirements</Primary></IndexTerm>
</Title>

<Para>
The system library "/usr/lib/libc.a" (version 4.4.2 and better) or the
shared library "/lib/libc.so.x" contain all necessary system calls to
succesfully compile the NIS client and server software. For the
GNU C Library 2 (glibc 2.x), you also need /lib/libnsl.so.1.
</Para>

<Para>
Some people reported that NIS only works with "/usr/lib/libc.a" version
4.5.21 and better so if you want to play it safe don't use older
libc's.  The NIS client software can be obtained from:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
  Site                  Directory                        File Name

  ftp.kernel.org        /pub/linux/utils/net/NIS         yp-tools-2.8.tar.gz
  ftp.kernel.org        /pub/linux/utils/net/NIS         ypbind-mt-1.13.tar.gz
  ftp.kernel.org        /pub/linux/utils/net/NIS         ypbind-3.3.tar.gz
  ftp.kernel.org        /pub/linux/utils/net/NIS         ypbind-3.3-glibc5.diff.gz
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
Once you obtained the software, please follow the instructions which
come with the software. yp-clients 2.2 are for use with libc4 and libc5
until 5.4.20. libc 5.4.21 and glibc 2.x needs yp-tools 1.4.1 or later.
The new yp-tools 2.4 should work with every Linux libc. Since there was
a bug in the NIS code, you shouldn't use libc 5.4.21-5.4.35. Use libc
5.4.36 or later instead, or the most YP programs will not work.
ypbind 3.3 will work with all libraries, too. If you use gcc 2.8.x or
greater, egcs or glibc 2.x, you should add the ypbind-3.3-glibc5.diff
patch to ypbind 3.3. If possible you should avoid the use of ypbind 3.3
for security reasons.
ypbind-mt is a new, multithreaded daemon. It needs a Linux 2.2 kernel
and glibc 2.1 or later.

<Para>
After you have succesfully compiled the software you are now ready
to install it. A suitable place for the ypbind daemon is the directory
/usr/sbin. Some people may tell you that you don't need
ypbind on a system with NYS. This is wrong. ypwhich and ypcat need it
always.
</Para>

<Para>
You must do this as root of course. The other binaries (ypwhich,
ypcat, yppasswd, yppoll, ypmatch) should go in a directory accessible
by all users, normally /usr/bin.
</Para>

<Para>
Newer ypbind versions have a configuration file called /etc/yp.conf. You can
hardcode a NIS server there - for more info see the manual page for ypbind(8).
You also need this file for NYS.
An example:

<Screen>
ypserver 10.10.0.1
ypserver 10.0.100.8
ypserver 10.3.1.1
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
If the system can resolve the hostnames without NIS, you may use
the name, otherwise you have to use the IP address. ypbind 3.3 has a bug
and will only use the last entry (ypserver 10.3.1.1 in the example). All
other entries are ignored. ypbind-mt handle this correct and uses
that one, which answerd at first.
</Para>

<Para>
It might be a good idea to test ypbind before  incorporating it in the
startup files. To test ypbind do the following:
</Para>

<Para>

<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>

<Para>
Make sure you have your YP-domain name set. If it is not set then
issue the command:


<Screen>
	    /bin/domainname nis.domain

</Screen>


where <Literal remap="tt">nis.domain</Literal> should be some string _NOT_ normally
associated with the DNS-domain name of your machine! The reason for
this is that it makes it a little harder for external crackers
to retreive the password database from your NIS servers. If you
don't know what the NIS domain name is on your network, ask
your system/network administrator.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

Start up "<Command>/sbin/portmap</command>" if it is not already running.

To check if the domainname is set correct, use the

yp-tools 2.2. It uses the yp_get_default_domain() function which is more
restrict. It doesn't allow for example the "(none)" domainname, which
is the default under Linux and makes a lot of problems.
</Para>

If the test worked you may now want to change your startupd files

act as a NIS client. Make sure that the domainname will
be set before you start ypbind.

You can also use the + and - characters to include/exclude or change
users. If you want to exclude the user guest just add -guest to your

You want to use a different shell (e.g. ksh) for
the user "linux"?  No problem, just add "+linux::::::/bin/ksh"
(without the quotes) to your <filename>/etc/passwd</filename>. Fields
that you don't want
to change have to be left empty. You could also use Netgroups for
user control.
</Para>

</Title>

<Para>
Shadow passwords over NIS are always a bad idea. You loose the security,
which shadow gives you, and it is supported by only some few Linux C
Libraries. A good way to avoid shadow passwords over NIS is,
to put only the local system users in /etc/shadow. Remove the NIS user
entries from the shadow database, and put the password back in passwd.
So you can use shadow for the root login, and normal passwd for NIS
user. This has the advantage that it will work with every NIS client.
</Para>

The only Linux libc which supports shadow passwords over NIS, is the

The Linux NIS+ client code was developed for the GNU C library 2.
There is also a port for Linux libc5, since most commercial Applications
where linked against this library in the past, and you cannot recompile
them for using glibc. There are problems with libc5 and NIS+:
static programs cannot be linked with it, and programs compiled
with this library will not work with other libc5 versions.
</Para>

<Para>
As base System you need a glibc based Distribution like Debian,
Red Hat Linux or SuSE Linux. If you have a Linux Distribution, which

After installing the new libc and nis-tools, create the credentials for
the new client on the NIS+ server. Make sure portmap is running. Then
check if your Linux PC has the same time as the NIS+ Server. For secure RPC,
you have only a small window from about 3 minutes, in which the credentials
are valid. A good idea is to run xntpd on every host. After this, run

Compile the software to generate the <Command>ypserv</Command> and
<Command>makedbm</Command>
programs. ypserv-2.x only supports the securenets file for access
restrictions.
</Para>

<Para>
If you run your server as master, determine what files you require to be
available via NIS and then add or remove the appropriate
entries to the "all" rule in <filename>/var/yp/Makefile</filename>.
You always should look at the Makefile and edit the Options at the
beginning of the file.
</Para>

<Para>
There was one big change between ypserv 1.1 and ypserv 1.2. Since
version 1.2, the file handles are cached. This means you have to
call makedbm always with the -c option if you create new maps. Make
sure, you are using the
new <filename>/var/yp/Makefile</filename> from ypserv 1.2 or later,
or add the -c flag to makedbm in the Makefile. If you don't do that,
ypserv will continue to use the old maps, and not the updated one.
</Para>

<Para>
Now edit <filename>/var/yp/securenets</filename> and
<filename>/etc/ypserv.conf</filename>.
For more information, read the ypserv(8) and ypserv.conf(5) manual pages.

On a slave make sure that <Command>ypwhich -m</Command> works. This means,

If you have bigger problems, you could start <Command>ypserv</Command> and
<Command>ypbind</Command> in debug

wrong.
</Para>

<Para>
If you need to update a map, run <Command>make</Command> in the
<Literal remap="tt">/var/yp</Literal>
directory on the NIS master. This will update a map if the source file
is newer, and push the files to the slave servers. Please don't use
<Command>ypinit</Command> for updating a map.
</Para>

<Para>
You might want to edit root's crontab *on the slave* server and add the
following lines:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>

      55 6,18 * * *    /usr/lib/yp/ypxfr_2perday
</Screen>

This will ensure that most NIS maps are kept up-to-date, even if an
update is missed because the slave was down at the time the update was
done on the master.
</Para>

<Para>
You can add a slave at every time later. At first, make sure that
the new slave server has permissions to contact the NIS master. Then run

<Screen>
    % /usr/lib/yp/ypinit -s masterhost
</Screen>

on the new slave. On the master server, add the new slave server name
to <filename>/var/yp/ypservers</filename> and run
<Command>make</Command> in <Literal remap="tt">/var/yp</Literal>
to update the map.
</Para>

<Para>
If you want to restrict access for users to your NIS server, you'll have
to setup the NIS server as a client as well by running ypbind and adding the
plus-entries to <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> _halfway_
the password file. The library
functions will ignore all normal entries after the first NIS entry, and
will get the rest of the info through NIS. This way the NIS access rules
are maintained. An example:

</Title>

<Para>
rpc.ypxfrd is used for speed up the transfer of very large
NIS  maps  from a NIS master to NIS slave servers. If a
NIS slave server receives a message that there is  a  new
map,  it  will  start  ypxfr  for transfering the new map.
ypxfr will read the contents of  a  map  from  the  master
server  using the yp_all() function. This process can take
several minutes when there are very large maps which  have
to store by the database library.
</Para>

<Para>
The  rpc.ypxfrd  server  speeds up the transfer process by
allowing NIS slave  servers  to  simply  copy  the  master
server's  map  files  rather  than building their own from
scratch.  rpc.ypxfrd uses an RPC-based file transfer  protocol,
so that there is no need for building a new map.
</Para>

<Para>
rpc.ypxfrd can be started by inetd. But since it starts
very slow, it should be started with ypserv. You need to start
rpc.ypxfrd only on the NIS master server.

<Para>
Whenever users change their passwords, the NIS password database and
probably other NIS databases, which depend on the NIS password
database, should be updated.  The program "rpc.yppasswdd" is a server that
handles password changes and makes sure that the NIS information will
be updated accordingly. rpc.yppasswdd is now integrated in ypserv. You
don't need the older, separate yppasswd-0.9.tar.gz or yppasswd-0.10.tar.gz,
and you shouldn't use them any longer.
</Para>

<Para>
You need to start rpc.yppasswdd only on the NIS master server. By default,
users are not allowed to change their full name or the login shell.
You can allow this with the -e chfn or -e chsh option.
</Para>

<Para>
If your passwd and shadow files are not in another directory then
/etc, you need to add the -D option. For example, if you have put
all source files in /etc/yp and wish to allow the user to change
his shell, you need to start rpc.yppasswdd with the following parameters:
</Para>

<Para>
The length of one entry is limited by the NIS protocol to 1024 characters.
You can't just increase this value and recompile the system. Every system
that uses NIS v2 expects key and data values to be no more than 1024 bytes
in size; if you suddenly make YPMAXRECORD larger on your client and server,
you will break interoperability with all other systems on your network that
use NIS. To make it work right, you'd have to go to every vendor that supports
NIS and get them to all make the change at the same time. Chances are you
won't be able to do this.
</Para>

With glibc 2.1 and newer this limit was removed from the glibc NIS
implementation. So it is possible under Linux to use longer entries,
but only if you have no other NIS clients or servers in your network.
</Para>

To allow the creation of NIS maps with a longer entry, you need to add
the <Literal remap="tt">--no-limit-check</Literal> option to the

<Literal remap="tt">/var/yp/Makefile</Literal>.

There is another way of solving this problem for
<filename>/etc/group</filename> entries. This idea is
from Ken Cameron:
</Para>

<Screen>
1. Break the entry into more than one line and name each group
   slightly differnet.

2. keep the GID the same for all.

3. have the first entry with the right group name and the GID.
   I don't put any user names in this one.

What happens is that going by user name you pick up the GID when the code
reads it. Then going the other way it stops after the first match of GID
and takes that name. It's ugly but works!

<Title>Changing passwords with rpasswd
<IndexTerm><Primary

</Title>

<Para>
The standard way to change a NIS password is to call
<command>yppasswd</command>, on some systems this is only
an alias for <command>passwd</command>. This commands uses
the yppasswd protocol and needs a running
<command>rpc.yppasswdd</command> process on the NIS master
server. The protocol has the disadvantage, that the old
password will be send in clear text over the network.
This is not so problematic, if the password change was
successfull. In this case, the old password is replaced
with the new one. But if the password change fails, an attacker
can use the clear password to login as this user.
Even more worse: If the system administrator changes the
NIS password for another user, the root password of the NIS
master server is transfered in clear text over the network.
And this one will not be changed.
</Para>

<Para>
One solution is to not use yppasswd for changing the password.
Instead, a good alternative is the <command>rpasswd</command>
command from the <Literal remap="tt">pwdutils</Literal> package.
