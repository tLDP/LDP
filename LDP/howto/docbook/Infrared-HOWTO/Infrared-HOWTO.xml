<para>
The Infrared-HOWTO provides an introduction to Linux and
infrared devices and how to use the software provided by the Linux/IrDA
project. This package uses IrDA(TM) compliant standards. IrDA(TM) is an
industrial standard for infrared wireless communication, and most laptops made
after January 1996 are equipped with an IrDA(TM) compliant infrared
transceiver. Infrared ports let you communicate with printers, modems, fax
machines, LANs, and other laptops or PDAs. Speed ranges from 2400bps to 4Mbps.
</para>

<para>
The Linux/IrDA stack supports IrLAP, IrLMP, IrIAS, IrIAP, IrLPT, IrCOMM,
IrOBEX, and IrLAN. Several of the protocols are implemented as both clients
and servers. There is also support for multiple IrLAP connections, via
several IrDA(TM) devices at once. The Linux/IrDA project started at the end
of 1997 and experienced some major rewrites since then. Please don't expect every
feature working straight yet. As far as I know Linux/IrDA is the only open source IrDA
implementation available.
</para>

<para>
Remote Control (RC) via infrared is the aim of the 
Linux Infrared Remote Control - LIRC project, and also described in this HOWTO.

<title>Project History</title>

<para>
   The project started at the end of 1997 with the name Linux/IrDA. Due
   to some troubles with the name IrDA, which is trademarked by the
   Infrared Data Association IrDA , the name was changed to Linux/IR. At
   the end of 1998 the relationship between both became better and
   the name was changed to Linux/IrDA again. Since February 1999 the
   project is an official member of IrDA .
</para>

<para>
   Companies and developers which are interested in joining these efforts
   should contact the Linux/IrDA Project or me at &lt;wehe_at_tuxmobil.org&gt;.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="infrared-howto-s-code-history">
<title>Code History</title>

<para>
   The Linux/IrDA project has undertaken some changes in the program
   code, which you should know to understand some possible confusions
   with older documentation, which you shouldn't use anyway.
</para>


<warning>
<para>
   Some caveats in the documentation have been caused by changes of the following
   concepts, device names and parameters. I hope I have got them alright now, they confused me
   sometimes, too. The new style stuff works from Kernel 2.2.15 / 2.4.0.
   Some important changes were made again in Kernel 2.6, not all of these are
   mentioned in this document yet, I will fix that hopefully soon.
   Anyway I recommend not to use any earlier kernel version than 2.6.
   This document will describe
   differences to the kernel 2.4 series in the appropriate places
   to provide documentation for situations where you must
   use kernel 2.4, which is hopefully rare.
   <!-- FIXME -->
   You should always use current Kernel, irda-utils and documentation.

   Sometimes, when you compile the IrDA stack or some various IrDA package, you
   may have the compiler complaining the things such as IRLMP_HINT_MASK_SET or
   IRDAPROTO_ULTRA are not defined.  This is because of a mess related to
   kernel headers and the way most distributions deal with it. If you have the
   2.4.X kernel source lying around, the fix is simple. Just copy the header
   irda.h from the kernel to your include directory 
   <command>cp /usr/src/linux/include/linux/irda.h /usr/include/linux</command>

   Debian/GNU Linux provides an irda-utils package since Potato.

   Some caveat with precompiled packages might be some incompatibilities
   between kernel version and appropriate package version.

<title>irattach</title>

<para>
   <command>irattach</command> uses the module set as 
   parameter; it can be a specific 
   FIR driver: <command>irattach toshoboe</command>
   or <command>ircomm</command> (and then it loads the module aliased 
   as "irda0" in <filename>/etc/modules.conf</filename>)
</para>

<para>
   If you are one of the lucky people which have a FIR chipset that is
   supported, then you don't need to use irattach anymore. Now you just
   have to modprobe the driver.
</para>

</sect4>

<sect4>
<title>irdadump</title>

<para>
   A program that displays all the frames sent, and received on the
   infrared link.
</para>

<para>
   One advantage of implementing IrDA device drivers as network device
   drivers is that you should be able to attach sniffers to the device
   (or actually the packet type). That way, it is possible to use a
   really handy utility called irdadump (instead of tcpdump). This will
   make debugging MUCH easier. Linux-2.2 implements the BPF (Berkeley
   Packet Filter), so its possible to filter out exactly the frames you
   want to see.
</para>

<para>
   Note: You probably have to be root for using <command>irdadump</command> . CONFIG_PACKET
   has to be enabled in the kernel. If compiled as a module you might
   load the module manually. <command>irdadump</command>
   has been converted into a library,
   so it can be used from GUI applications as well.
</para>

<para>
   Here is a sample output of a small session between Linux and a Palm
   III. This log shows that the local irobex layer is not responding, so
   the Palm III sends a disc frame.

<title>irdaping</title>

<para>
   Makes it possible to try and ping a remote device using IrDA test
   frames. Not all devices implement support for test frames. This is a
   program similar to ping(8). It sends IrDA test frames, enriched by some
   userdata which contain the frame number and the time the frame was
   sent. You can also change the size of the frame by using the 
   <command>-s</command>
   option. You must supply an IrDA device address, and not an IP address.
   You have to be able to get that device address by using irdadump.

<title>openobex</title>

<para>
   The overall goal of the 
   <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openobex/">OpenOBEX</ulink>
   project is to make an open source
   implementation of the Object Exchange (OBEX) protocol. <acronym>OBEX</acronym> is a
   session protocol and can best be described as a binary HTTP protocol.
   <acronym>OBEX</acronym> is builtin in devices 
   like PDA's like the Palm Pilot, and mobile phones
   like the Ericsson R320, Siemens S25, Siemens S45, Siemens ME45, Nokia NM207 and

<title>IrNET for Linux-IrDA</title>

<para>
   <ulink url="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/IrDA/index.html">IrNET</ulink> 
   is a protocol allowing to carry TCP/IP traffic between two IrDA
   peers in an efficient fashion. It is a thin layer, passing PPP packets
   in a IrTTP socket. It uses PPP in synchronous mode for efficiency, and
   offers lots of flexibility and various features. The main part of
   IrNET in included in kernel 2.4.x, and a user-space daemon (to
   automate connections) is available on the web page.

   developers can develop applications involving infrared access much
   easily. The API is very similar to java.net.Socket API and has been
   implemented using the Linux infrared stack. Both connection oriented
   streams (IrSocket and IrServerSocket) and connectionless Ultra

<title>General Parameters</title>

<para>
   Make sure you use kernel 2.6 sources. I recommend not to use 
   any earlier kernel version, but this document will describe
   differences to the kernel 2.4 series in the appropriate places.
   If unsure about your kernel version try <command>uname -r</command>.
</para>

<para>
   For current 2.6 kernels there are no patches necessary.
   In case there is a kernel patch from the Linux/IrDA project or
   other places to apply (for example for kernel 2.4), 
   put it into the directory <filename>/usr/src</filename> 
   or where else your kernel sources live and apply something like (replace
   <filename>patch-2_4.0-irdaXXX</filename> with the actual file name):

<programlisting role="small">
cd /usr/src
tar xvzf patch-2_4.0-irdaXXX.tar.gz
cd linux
patch -p1 -l &lt; ../patch-2_4.0-irdaXXX
</programlisting>

   For latest drivers experimental support has to be enabled
   <command>CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL</command>, at least in kernel 2.4.
</para>

<para>
   Enable sysctl in "General Setup" <command>CONFIG_SYSCTL</command>.
</para>

<para>
   You should have proc file system support <command>CONFIG_PROC_FS</command>.
</para>

<para>
   Also serial support for the SIR features <command>CONFIG_SERIAL</command>.
</para>

<para>
   I am not sure whether there has to be printer support for using a
   printer with Linux/IrDA <command>CONFIG_PRINTER</command>. But I assume this feature is
   not necessary.
</para>

<para>
   Networking support _must_ be enabled <command>CONFIG_NET</command>.
</para>

<para>
   Make sure you have module support <command>CONFIG_MODULES</command> in your kernel! Test
   it e.g. with <command>lsmod</command>.
</para>

<para>

   Also kerneld support <command>CONFIG_KERNELD</command>. But <command>kmod</command> 
   (<command>CONFIG_KMOD</command>) also
   works. A monolithic kernel seems to work, too. But modules are highly
   recommended!
</para>

<para>
   To use <command>irdadump</command> you probably have to set <command>CONFIG_PACKET</command>.
</para>

<para>
   If you only apply the Linux/IrDA patch, you should not have to do a
   make clean, so that should save you some time. I suggest you do
   something like this:
</para>

<para>
   For kernel 2.4 use: 
   <command>make dep &amp;&amp; make all &amp;&amp; make modules 
   &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; make modules_install</command>.
   For kernel 2.6 use: 
   <command>make all &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; make modules_install</command>.
   If you get really strange errors, then try to rebuild from scratch
   after a <command>make clean</command>.
</para>

</para>

<sect3>
<title>IrDA subsystem support</title>

<para>
CONFIG_IRDA
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrDA (TM) protocols.
  The Infrared Data Associations (tm) specifies standards for wireless
  infrared communication and is supported by most laptops and PDA's.
</para>

<para>
  To use Linux support for the IrDA (tm) protocols, you will also need
  some user-space utilities like irattach
  . For more information, see the file
  Documentation/networking/irda.txt. You also want to read the
  InfraRed-HOWTO, available at 
  <ulink url="http://tuxmobil.org/howtos.html">TuxMobil</ulink>
  .
</para>

<para>
  This support is also available as a module called irda.o. If you
  want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.
</para>

<para>
IrDA Cache last LSAP
</para>

<para>
CONFIG_IRDA_CACHE_LAST_LSAP
  Say Y here if you want IrLMP to cache the last LSAP used. This makes
  sense since most frames will be sent/received on the same
  connection. Enabling this option will save a hash-lookup per frame.
</para>

<para>
  If unsure, say Y.
</para>

<para>
IrDA Fast RR's
</para>

<para>
CONFIG_IRDA_FAST_RR
  Say Y here is you want IrLAP to send fast RR (Receive Ready) frames
  when acting as a primary station. This will make IrLAP send out a RR
  frame immediately when receiving a frame if its own transmit queue
  is currently empty. This will give a lot of speed improvement when
  receiving much data since the secondary station will not have to
  wait the max. turn around time before it is allowed to transmit the
  next time. If the transmit queue of the secondary is also empty the
  primary will back off waiting longer for sending out the RR frame
  until the timeout reaches the normal value. Enabling this option
  will make the IR-diode burn more power and thus reduce your battery
  life.
</para>

<para>
  If unsure, say N.
</para>

<para>
IrDA Debug
</para>

<para>
CONFIG_IRDA_DEBUG
  Say Y here if you want the IrDA subsystem to write debug information
  to your syslog. You can change the debug level in
  <filename>/proc/sys/net/irda/debug</filename>
</para>

<para>
  If unsure, say Y (since it makes it easier to find the bugs).
</para>

<para>
IrLAP Compression support
</para>

<para>
CONFIG_IRDA_COMPRESSION
  Compression is _not_ part of the IrDA(tm) protocol specification,
  but it's working great! Linux is the first to try out compression
  support at the IrLAP layer. This means that you will only benefit
  from compression if you are running a Linux &lt;-&gt; Linux configuration.
</para>

<para>
  If you say Y here, you also need to say Y or M to a compression
  protocol below.
</para>

<para>
IrLAP Deflate Compression Protocol (EXPERIMENTAL)
</para>

<para>
CONFIG_IRDA_DEFLATE
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the Deflate compression
  protocol. The deflate compression (GZIP) is exactly
  the same as the one used by the PPP protocol. 
</para>

<para>
  If you want to compile this compression support as a module, say M
  here and read Documentation/modules.txt. The module will be called
  irda_deflate.o.
</para>

<para>
IrLAN Protocol 
   But currently the IrLAN protocol is no longer maintained
   by the Linux/IrDA core team.
</para>

<para>
CONFIG_IRLAN
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrLAN protocol. If
  you want to compile it as a module (irlan.o), say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt. IrLAN emulates an Ethernet and makes it
  possible to put up a wireless LAN using infrared beams.
</para>

<para>
  The IrLAN protocol can be used to talk with infrared access points 
  like the HP NetbeamIR, or the ESI JetEye NET. You can also connect 
  to another Linux machine running the IrLAN protocol for ad-hoc 
  networking!
</para>

<para>
IrCOMM Protocol
</para>

<para>
CONFIG_IRCOMM
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrCOMM protocol. If
  you want to compile it as a module (you will get <command>ircomm.o</command> and
  <command>ircomm-tty.o</command>), say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. IrCOMM
  implements serial port emulation, and makes it possible to use all
  existing applications that understands TTY's with an infrared link.
  Thus you should be able to use application like PPP, minicom and
  others. Enabling this option will create two modules called <filename>ircomm</filename>
  and <filename>ircomm-tty</filename>.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Device Drivers</title>

<para>
IrTTY IrDA Device Driver
</para>

<para>
CONFIG_IRTTY_SIR
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrTTY line
  discipline. If you want to compile it as a module (irtty.o), say M
  here and read Documentation/modules.txt. IrTTY makes it possible to
  use Linux's own serial driver for all IrDA ports that are 16550
  compatible. Most IrDA chips are 16550 compatible so you should
  probably say Y to this option. Using IrTTY will however limit the
  speed of the connection to 115200 bps (IrDA SIR mode)
</para>

<para>
  If unsure, say Y.
</para>

<para>
IrPORT IrDA Device Driver
</para>

<para>
CONFIG_IRPORT_SIR
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrPORT IrDA device
  driver. If you want to compile it as a module (irport.o), say M here
  and read Documentation/modules.txt. IrPORT can be used instead of
  IrTTY and sometimes this can be better. One example is if your IrDA
  port does not have echo-canceling, which will work OK with IrPORT
  since this driver is working in half-duplex mode only. You don't
  need to use <command>irattach</command> with IrPORT, but you just insert it the same
  way as FIR drivers (<command>insmod irport io=0x3e8 irq=11</command>). Notice that
  IrPORT is a SIR device driver which means that speed is limited to
  115200 bps.
</para>

<para>
  If unsure, say Y.
</para>

<para>
Winbond W83977AF IrDA Device Driver
</para>

<para>
CONFIG_WINBOND_FIR
  Say Y here if you want to build IrDA support for the Winbond
  W83977AF super-io chipset. This driver should be used for the IrDA
  chipset in the Corel NetWinder. The driver supports SIR, MIR and FIR
  (4Mbps) speeds.
</para>

<para>
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt. The module will be called w83977af_ir.o.
</para>

<para>
NSC PC87108 IrDA Device Driver
</para>

<para>
CONFIG_NSC_FIR
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the NSC PC87108 and
  PC87338 IrDA chipsets. This driver supports SIR, 
  MIR and FIR (4Mbps) speeds. 
</para>

<para>
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt. The module will be called nsc-ircc.o.
</para>

<para>
Toshiba Type-O IR Port Device Driver
</para>

<para>
CONFIG_TOSHIBA_FIR
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the Toshiba Type-O IR
  chipset. This chipset is used by the Toshiba Libretto 100CT, and
  many more laptops. If you want to compile it as a module, say M here
  and read Documentation/modules.txt. The module will be called
  toshoboe.o.
</para>

<para>
SMC IrCC (Experimental)
</para>

<para>
CONFIG_SMC_IRCC_FIR
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the SMC Infrared
  Communications Controller. It is used in the Fujitsu Lifebook 635t
  and Sony PCG-505TX. If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read Documentation/modules.txt. The module will be called
  smc-ircc.o.
</para>

<para>
ALi M5123 FIR Controller Driver (Experimental)
</para>

<para>
CONFIG_ALI_FIR
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the ALi M5123 FIR 
  Controller. The ALi M5123 FIR Controller is embedded in ALi
  M1543C, M1535, M1535D, M1535+, M1535D South Bridge. This 
  driver supports SIR, MIR and FIR (4Mbps) speeds.
</para>

<para>
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt. The module will be called ali-ircc.o.
</para>

<para>
Serial dongle support
</para>

<para>
CONFIG_DONGLE
  Say Y here if you have an infrared device that connects to your
  computer's serial port. These devices are called dongles. Then say Y
  or M to the driver for your particular dongle below.
</para>

<para>
  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause this configure script to skip all
</para>

<para>
ESI JetEye PC Dongle
</para>

<para>
CONFIG_ESI_DONGLE
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the Extended Systems
  JetEye PC dongle. If you want to compile it as a module, say M here
  and read Documentation/modules.txt. The ESI dongle attaches to the
  normal 9-pin serial port connector, and can currently only be used
  by IrTTY. To activate support for ESI dongles you will have to
  start irattach like this: <command>irattach -d esi</command>.
</para>

<para>
ACTiSYS IR-220L and IR220L+ dongle
</para>

<para>
CONFIG_ACTISYS_DONGLE
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the ACTiSYS
  IR-220L and IR220L+ dongles. If you want to compile it as a module,
  say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. The ACTiSYS dongles
  attaches to the normal 9-pin serial port connector, and can
  currently only be used by IrTTY. To activate support for ACTiSYS
  dongles you will have to start irattach like this: 
  <command>irattach -d actisys</command> or <command>irattach -d actisys+</command>.
</para>

<para>

From Florian Lohoff <!-- flo_at_rfc822.org -->
You should also set "port 0x0 irq 0" otherwise you will see interesting
effects if there is suddenly a different S1 e.g. by inserting
a modem PCMCIA card. The serial driver will then touch
the OLD ports without having acquired those which will cause
the irda stuff to die/hang. This is a bug i havent been able
to find in the serial driver but it definitly
exists (Put a printk into the serial_out serial_in stuff).

<!--
   When you do modprobe irlan, the hotplug system tries to configure it, and
   since this is not setup right, the configuration never ends. When you then
   do ifconfig, it hangs, since hotplug is already doing that.
   I had to modify the net.agent file, in order to stop hotplug from
   configuring. After that I was able to do ifconfig irlan0 192.168.2.2

<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>
   Try to find out which serial port is used by the IR device. You
   may do so by watching the output of 
   <command>dmesg</command>. If serial support is
   modularized do an <command>modprobe serial</command>
   first. Look for an entry like:

<programlisting role="small">
Serial driver version 4.25 with no serial options enabled
ttyS00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A     #first serial port /dev/ttyS0
ttyS01 at 0x3000 (irq = 10) is a 16550A    #e.g. infrared port
ttyS02 at 0x0300 (irq = 3) is a 16550A     #e.g. PCMCIA modem port
</programlisting>

   If this is not the case, you either don't have infrared support
   enabled in the BIOS or the SIR mode of your infrared device is not
   detected by the kernel. Currently I know only two laptop models
   with this effect, the HP OmniBook 800 and the Toshiba Libretto
   models. I am not sure whether PnP support effects the detection of
   the IR port. If you are unsure try it out and let me know the
   results. Maybe you can use FIR mode if SIR doesn't work.

</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</para>

<para>
   Up to 115.200bps (SIR) many (probably all) infrared controllers work
   like a serial port and use a RZI (return to zero, inverted)
   modulation. Not every infrared controller supports 4Mps (FIR), up to
   4Mbps they have to use 4PPM (4 pulse position) modulation technique.
   A list of supported FIR chips is included in
   <filename>/usr/src/linux/drivers/net/irda/Kconfig</filename>. 
   <!-- FIXME include survey -->
   You may start the FIR
   service by loading the according module. Linux/IrDA will probe your
   hardware then. More drivers are under development.
</para>

<para>
   So what speeds can you expect? Using SIR, you should be able to get
   about 10 Kbytes/s. Using FIR (4Mbps) you can get over 300 Kbytes/s (if
   you are lucky).

<title>Dongle Connection - Infrared Adapters for the Serial Port</title>

<para>
   A survey of supported dongles is included in
   <filename>/usr/src/linux/drivers/net/irda/Kconfig</filename>. 
   <!-- FIXME include survey -->
</para>

<para>
   Dag Brattli wrote (modified by wh): "To use dongles you have to do
   something like this:

<programlisting role="small">
modprobe tekram         # or esi or actisys
irattach -d tekram      # or -d esi or -d actisys
</programlisting>

   <command>modprobe</command> is not necessary, if 
   <filename>/etc/modules.conf</filename> is correct.
   As you can see, you must still use the <command>-d</command>
   option with <command>irattach</command> since
   it is possible to have two serial ports using different dongles at the
   same time (so the tty you are binding must know which dongle it is
   supposed to use). So if you have two dongles and two serial ports, you
   could do something like this:

<programlisting role="small">
modprobe tekram
modprobe esi
irattach /dev/ttyS0 -d esi &amp;
irattach /dev/ttyS1 -d tekram &amp;
</programlisting>

   PS: I would not try to turn the two dongles against each other, since
   I really don't know how the stack would react :-) ... Since I don't
   have any of these new ACTiSYS 220L+ dongles, I'm not able to test it.
   Since the new dongle has support for one extra speed (38400bps), you
   must specify the dongles differently with 
   <command>irattach</command> so that the kernel
   knows which dongle you are using (and what QoS can be used):

<programlisting role="small">
irattach /dev/ttyS0 -d actisys     # for the 220L dongle
irattach /dev/ttyS0 -d actisys+    # for the 220L+ dongle
</programlisting>

   The current implementation of dongle support does not have any state
   associated with it, so its not possible to use both ACTiSYS dongles
   (220L and 220L+) at the same time (connected to two serial ports) for
   now. If someone needs to be able to do so, please mail me (Dag
   Brattli) and I will think about it!"

   Note: When I tried to use an infrared modem (Swissmod 56Ki,

   infrared support in the BIOS to get it working!

   Dag Brattli: "It is now possible to use 
   <command>irport</command> instead of <command>irtty</command>! I
   have moved all the dongle stuff out of <command>irtty</command> 
   and into <command>irda_device</command>, so
   it will also be possible to attach dongles to irport. Need however to
   make a small user-space utility <command>dongle_attach</command> 
   that can be used to
   attach dongles to a specific driver instance. 
   BTW: <command>irattach</command> is still
   working as before, and you will not notice the difference even when
   attaching dongles to <command>irtty</command> 
   (I've just redirected the dongle ioctl to
   <command>irda_device</command>). Irport may be 
   interesting since you avoid one software
   interrupt (bh) level, and it's also forced to work in half duplex mode
   so you don't get any echo if the irda port itself don't have
   echo-cancellation (Girbil dongle and HP-4000 etc) ... To use it, you
   must supply the parameters to <command>modprobe</command> 
   like this: <command>modprobe irport io=0x3f8
   irq=4</command>, or whichever 
   values you use. You can also add these parameters

   From James I have this description about setting

   connector and a 6 pin DIL (at the end of a 18 pin DIL header).
   Basically any IrDA compatible transceiver will work (I have a stack of
   old IRM3001 these are now obselete) you need to hook a capacitor (use
   a tantalum about ~1uF) between 5V and 0V near the transceiver and then
   connect everthing else up 
   (RX-&gt;RX, TX-&gt;TX, 5V-&gt;5V, and 0V-0V). If you
   don't like soldering irons, lots of companies do sell IR modules for

PPP

   latest IrCOMM patch (050998) of Takahide Higuchi, I managed to
   HotSync and establish a PPP connection between my Palm III and my
   Linux box. I'm using IRLink (from IsComplete) to redirect the
   serial port to ir. Communication with <command>pilot-xfer</command>
   (available from the "pilot-link" package at
   <ulink url="http://www.slac.com/pilone/kpilot_home/">kpilot</ulink>
   ) works
   flawlessly. Although I was able to establish a PPP connection, I'm
   still unable to fetch mail and do Web browsing. This is probably
   due to connection time-outs. I am checking this out. Please see
   the 
   <ulink url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/PPP-HOWTO/">PPP-HOWTO</ulink> 
   for further information about PPP.
   I managed to establish an apparently robust connection between
   my Linux box and a Palm III. The pppd invocation I use is as
   follows:

<programlisting role="small">
   /usr/sbin/pppd /dev/ircomm0 57600 192.168.2.10:192.168.2.11
   proxyarp passive silent persist noauth local nodetach
</programlisting>

   Over the PPP connection I used <command>ping</command>,
   <command>ssh</command>, and HTTP.
   Strange is however the fact that discovery must be enabled (maybe
   obsolete) . Otherwise, even with an active IrCOMM connection, the
   link goes down due to a IrLAP disconnect.
   The pilot-link tools (used for Linux/Palm synchronization) also
   ran flawlessly over IrCOMM via <filename>/dev/ircomm0</filename>."
   There are also reports about <command>kpilot</command>, though not working as
   flawlessly as <command>pilot-xfer</command>.

<title>Connecting from Linux to WinCE 2.11</title>

<para>
   Submitted by Arthur Tyde and Bryan Abshier of Linuxcare Inc.
</para>

<para>
   This will tell you how to set up a masqueraded PPP connection via.
   IrDA from WinCE to a Linux based notebook computer. Once you are IP
   connected, the rest is up to you. We put this together as a guide for
   Sony notebook users with Casio E-100/105 PDA's, though the procedure
   should work for any WinCE 2.11 device with infrared capabilities
   talking to any notebook. Do all the Linux side testing signed on as
   root, standard warnings apply.
</para>

<para>
Configure WinCE

   Configure a network connection for your WinCE device. Go into
   "Connections" and create a "Direct Connection" Name it something
   meaningful, for device select "Infrared Port". Go into settings and
   change the baud rate to 115200, this is the max for WinCE. Go to
   TCP/IP settings and check "Use server-assigned IP address," and "Use
   software compression," and "Use IP header compression" Make sure "Use
   Slip," is unchecked. For Name Servers, make sure "Use server-assigned
   addresses" is checked. Go to Start, Settings, Communications,
   Identification and enter something for the Device Name. (I used
   "cetoy") You most likely already have these values set if you have
   synced with a Win9x desktop using Activesynch.
</para>

<para>
Configure Linux/IrDA

   Set up IrDA support on your notebook (described elsewhere) and get to
   the point where your notebook will discover an IrDA compliant device.
   A good sign is the irda0 device will show up when you execute
   ifconfig. It will not have an IP address, this is ok.
</para>

<para>
Setup the Connection

   Test the discovery by setting an IrDA device in range of your IR port,
   wait 5 seconds, and;
</para>

<para>
   <command>cat /proc/net/irda/discovery</command>
</para>

<para>
   For example, the Ericsson I888 World Phone with IR port enabled should
   immediately show something like this;
</para>

<para>

<programlisting role="small">
"name:I 888 WORLD   ,hint:0x9104,saddr:0x838470e5,daddr:0x152dceaa"
</programlisting>

   Your WinCE machine will not be discovered unless it's actively looking
   for a connection. So, if you want to test with WinCE position your
   device and double tap on the network icon you created in step 2, you
   should see something like this:
</para>

<para>

<programlisting role="small">
"name:mytoy,hint:0x8204,saddr:0x838470e5,daddr:0x00000b72"
</programlisting>

   The name displayed will be whatever value you have entered into the
   Start, Settings, Communications, Identification as the Device Name. At
   this point, with basic IrDA functioning- we can move on to
   establishing a PPP connection for WinCE. These scripts can also be
   used for serial cable connects. Create the following files and copy
   them into the directory indicated.
</para>

<para>
   <command>/usr/sbin/cebox.sh</command> - make it executable

<programlisting role="small">
#!/bin/sh
pppd call cebox
</programlisting>

   Because Microsoft likes to break standards, you need the following
   chat script. This will feed WinCE the proper ASCII keywords it wants
   before allowing a PPP connection.
</para>

<para>
   <command>/etc/ppp/cebox.chat</command>

<programlisting role="small">
TIMEOUT 3600
"CLIENT"    "CLIENT\c"
""      "SERVER\c"
</programlisting>

   The following file will allow you to specify the IP addresses, IR (or
   serial port if using a cable) device, DNS and so forth. I do not
   recommend you change the 192.IP addresses below. WinCE really has an
   affection for 192.168.55.100 because all the MS synch tools seem to
   have it hardcoded. DNS can be whatever you normally use.
</para>

<para>
   /etc/ppp/peers/cebox

<programlisting role="small">
/dev/ircomm0 115200 crtscts
connect '/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/ppp/cebox.chat'
noauth
local

ms-dns 10.2.0.1
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>
Testing the connection

   Ok, now you can test the connection to make sure it all works. Reboot
   your machine, run irattach /dev/ttyS2 -s (/dev/ttyS2 being the
   serial port your BIOS sees the IR device as, if irattach is not
   running, start it) Align the IR ports, at the Linux command prompt
   type /usr/sbin/cebox.sh, and simultaneously press return to start
   cebox and double tap your connection icon in WinCE. You should get a
   happy message from WinCE reporting Connecting to Host, Device
   Connected, Authenticating User, User Authenticated and finally
   Connected. You should see something like this when you are connected:

<programlisting role="small">

</programlisting>

   The following script sets up IrDA, establishes a ppp connection with
   WinCE, and then sets up IP masquerading. It is provided as an example
   of how you can tie this all together. This is more or less a manual
   approach. You can get creative, start irattach at boot and stick a
   line in inittab to constantly look for a WinCE connection on the IR
   port. This will however, run down your batteries and limit your
   ability to access other IR gadgets. I just use the script below.
   Position the device, run wince and start communications on your PDA
   when the script tells you to.

   On the PocketPC side go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Connection -&gt; Modem. 
   Make a new connection, call it something meaningful (I use
   Linux-m), choose "Generic IrDA modem", set baud rate to 115200. Tap
   "Advanced". In "Port Settings" select 8-N-1-Hardware and check "Enter
   dialing commands manually". This is done so as PocketPC would not try
   to dial a phone number as we do not want it. The other two boxes
   should remain unchecked. In TCP/IP select "Use server-assigned IP
   address" uncheck "Use Slip", but check "Use software compression" and
   "Use IP header compression". In "name Servers" select "Use
   server-assigned addresses". Tap "ok" and "Next". You should not be
   asked for telephone number (if you are, just enter 1 and doublecheck
   that you actually selected manual dialing commands box in advanced
   section). Make sure that "Cancel call..." and "Wait for dial tone..."
   boxes are unchecked. We are now done with the PocketPC part.

<para>
   On Linux we must first make sure that all the necessary modules are
   loaded. Here are the modules that were loaded and in use during a
   successful communication session:

<programlisting role="small">

   Make sure that <command>ls -la /dev/ircomm*</command> produces a similar output:

   Now we have to enable a login terminal on the IrDA port. I used
   <command>agetty</command> (or your favorite getty variant) 
   for that purpose. Add the following line
   to your <filename>/etc/inittab</filename>:

<programlisting role="small">

</programlisting>

   save the file and activate it by restarting <command>init</command>:

   Also prepare the following shell script that will perform the second
   phase of connection:

<para>
   Now the connection itself: Align the IR ports and on the PocketPC go
   to Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Connections and tap the connection that you
   created (Linux-m). In the "Connect To" dialog that shows up leave
   everything unfilled and just tap on "Connect". "Manual Dialing
   Terminal" will show up. There you should see the login prompt for
   your Linux-box (If the login prompt does not show up at once, bring up
   the virtual keyboard and tap 'enter'). You do not need to login
   (though it is a bonus - speaking of the ultimate remote controller :)
</para>

<para>
   On the Linux-box execute the <command>pppd</command> command as soon as some "garbage"
   shows up in the PocketPC's terminal, tap "File" -&gt; "Continue". 
   <command>pppd</command> should come with the following message:

   And PocketPC should show a dialog with "Status: Connected". You can
   run <command>ifconfig</command> to check that ppp0 interface is up and running. 
   
   <command>ping 192.168.55.2</command> should produce something like that:

   It's easy to configure and it works
   with a lot of roaming providers and the german Tante T.  gh0st and me did
   some testing yesterday and we weren't able to connect to 
   the dial-in server of the HRZ with wvdial. wvdial
   always failed with "Bad password", because the server 
   respondend faster that the mobile softmodem could send
   the login and password strings.

   Gerhard Gonter reported: Several members of the list are successfully
   using the Ericsson mobile phone SH888 with the Linux-IrDA software,
   usually to use it as a modem. The software is also quite useful to
   access other parts of the phone using AT commands. The built-in
   phonebook is an interesting target.
</para>

<para>
   After A quick research on the Internet (FreshMeat, Deja, YAHOO), I did
   not find any phonebook tool for Linux (or another Unix). To solve that
   problem, I wrote a small Perl script and a related module. Since this
   now works acceptably well for me, I decided to wrap that up and
   release it at this early stage of development. The tarball can be
   retrieved

<para>
   In the mailing list <command>gsmlib</command> was also recommended, though ... there was
   no way for me to use this over infrared, no connection with my sh888.
   Florian Lohoff reported: Works (kind of) with the S25. I needed to
   change a ifdef as it seems the S25 does not respond with CR LF. But
   setting a link from /dev/mobilephone -&gt; /dev/ircomm lets me send SMS
   via the S25 without a problem. Phonebook backup does NOT work because
   the S25 does some silly responses to probably empty phonebooks.

   it. The standards are in Acrobat PDF format. The S25 supported

   Carlos Vidal wrote: Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that
   Nokia telephones do not contain a genuine hardware modem, but
   something which is similar in principle to WinModems for PC. Whenever
   Nokia writes about modem communication, they use the name "Windows
   software modem" (or something similar). Which is actually backed up by
   the need to use special Nokia software for Windows (called Nokia
   Cellular Data Suite).

   In the PC/Linux I run the program snooper (by Jun-ichiro itojun Itoh

   sniffers, WH) with small modifications in order to configure the
   serial port correctly.
</para>

<para>
   Normally, if snooper has the correct baud rate, the phone and the
   PC/W95 should communicate as if there was no snooper in between. This
   worked pretty well when I cracked the protocol of my Minolta camera.
   The problem here is that the phone doesn't answer or hangs after a

   0 is the PC/95 and 1 is the phone. The communication starts with a
   stream of 'U' (0x55) and with DSR/DTR on. The phone answers with '0x18
   0x00 ...'. This dialog continues for a while as if both were deaf and
   finally the phone crashes and the only way to reset it is to remove
   the batteries!
</para>

<para>
   I guess that what happens is that the phone is trying to find the
   correct baud-rate and fails because of the delays introduced by
   snooper. This probably has to do with some IrDA protocol used with
   also with the infrared connection."

<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
   Why this? Unfortunately Linux users are not always supplied with the
   necessary hardware information. Sometimes it is possible to look at
   this information in Microsoft-Windows. Sometimes its even useful to connect
   the two. Linux could also provide occasional access point services to
   a Microsoft-Windows laptop of a friend dropping by.
</para>

<para>
   Where to get it from? At 
   <ulink url="http://www.microsoft.com/">MicroSoft</ulink>
   in the directory 
   <filename>/Windows95/downloads/contents/WURecommended/S_WUCommunications/W95IrDA/</filename>
   you will find a support pack Infrared Transfer 2.0. It is a
   self-extracting archive W95IR.EXE with 331KB. Note: Microsoft seems to
   change the location of this file (and others) at random, the former
   URL is Microsoft Windows95 IrDA - Old
</para>

<para>
   Microsoft(tm) has three versions of IrDA support for Windows95. The
   version number can be found in the "Software" icon in the Control
   Panel and the file <filename>infrared.inf</filename>.
</para>

<para>
   Version 1.0 is still delivered with some hardware.
</para>

<para>
   Version 2.0 is the version they currently offer at their web site. It
   is in the self-extracting file <command>W95IR.EXE</command>. The last time I looked
   (1999-02-21) it was 434KB and was found at
   http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/W95IR.EXE the link
   is dead now.
   <!--
   <ulink url="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/W95IR.EXE">W95IR.EXE</ulink>
   -->
   Their website is frequently changing, so do not be surprised to find
   the file (also) in another location or not at all.
</para>

<para>
   Version 3.0 can/could be found in their downloadable Infrared
   development kit IRDDK30, but is mostly useful for developers. It is
   internally different from 2.0, it is based on "miniport" network
   drivers, just like the Linux version. It exists for some time and has
   some support for NT, but it clearly did not make it into the
   mainstream NT4.0 distributions. For 95 you are probably better off
   with 2.0. The choice may depend on the documentation of the drivers
   you get with your specific hardware.
</para>

<para>
   The Microsoft website also used to contain a nice utility IrXfer, contained in
   the archive <command>IRXFER.EXE</command>, This is the Infrared Transfer utility, which
   uses an IrOBEX variant I think, it is referenced in the IrOBEX
   protocol description. The utility was freely downloadable, but I could
   not find it the last time. It is a nice graphical utility which can be
   used to transfer files over IrDA between computers.
</para>

<para>
   With some machines, e.g. a HP Omnibook 800 it is necessary to use a
   vendor specific version of this package (for the HP Omnibook 800 you
   may find it on the recovery CD).

<para>
   Especially the <filename>..\windows\inf\*.inf</filename> files and the device manager are
   of interest to look for configuration details.

   As far as I know Window$NT doesn't support IrDA(TM). About Window$98 I
   have heard there is no IrDA(TM) support yet.

   compression!!! This is something which is exclusive for Linux as far

   problem for virtual consoles that expect to receive some translated

   work quite nice when using X but not for other virtual consoles.
   Anyway this is good enough for me, so I will not use a lot of time

<title>Obtaining Information about the Infrared Port in Laptops</title>

<para>
   To get the IrDA port of your laptop working with Linux/IrDA you may
   use StandardInfraRed (SIR) or FastInfraRed (FIR).
</para>

<sect2>
<title>SIR</title>

<para>
   Up to 115.200bps, the infrared port emulates a serial port like the
   16550A UART. This will be detected by the kernel serial driver at boot
   time, or when you load the serial module. If infrared support is
   enabled in the BIOS, for most laptops you will get a kernel message
   like:

<programlisting role="small">
Serial driver version 4.25 with no serial options enabled
ttyS00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A     #first serial port /dev/ttyS0
ttyS01 at 0x3000 (irq = 10) is a 16550A    #e.g. infrared port
ttyS02 at 0x0300 (irq = 3) is a 16550A     #e.g. PCMCIA modem port
</programlisting>

</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>FIR</title>

<para>
   If you want to use up to 4Mbps, your machine has to be equipped with a
   certain FIR chip. You need a certain Linux/IrDA driver to support this
   chip. Therefore you need exact information about the FIR chip. You may
   get this information in one of the following ways:
</para>

<para>

<orderedlist>

<listitem>
<para>
   Read the <emphasis>specification</emphasis> of the machine, 
   though it is very rare that you will find enough and reliable information there. 
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
   Try to find out whether the FIR chip is a <emphasis>PCI</emphasis> device.
   Do a <command>cat /proc/pci</command> . The appropriate files for 2.2.x
   kernels are in <filename>/proc/bus/pci</filename> . Though often the PCI
   information is incomplete. You may find the latest information about PCI
   devices and vendor numbers in the kernel documentation usually in
   <filename>/usr/src/linux/Documentation</filename> or at the page of
   <ulink url="http://members.datafast.net.au/~dft0802/">Craig Hart</ulink>.
   From kernel 2.1.82 on, you may use <command>lspci</command> from the
   <command>pci-utils</command> package, too.
   <!-- FIXME reference to old kernel issues -->

</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Try to get information about <emphasis>Plug-and-Play (PnP)</emphasis> devices. Though I didn't use them for this purpose yet, the <command>isapnp</command> tools, could be useful.

<para>
If you have installed the <emphasis>Linux/<trademark class="registered">IrDA</trademark> software</emphasis> load the FIR modules and watch the output of <command>dmesg</command>, whether FIR is detected or not.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Another way how to figure it out explained by Thomas Davis (modified by WH): "Dig through the FTP site of the vendor, find the <emphasis>Windows9x FIR drivers</emphasis>, and they have (for a SMC chip): 

<programlisting role="small">
-rw-rw-r--   1 ratbert  ratbert       743 Apr  3  1997 smcirlap.inf 
-rw-rw-r--   1 ratbert  ratbert     17021 Mar 24  1997 smcirlap.vxd 
-rw-rw-r--   1 ratbert  ratbert      1903 Jul 18  1997 smcser.inf 
-rw-rw-r--   1 ratbert  ratbert     31350 Jun  7  1997 smcser.vxd 
</programlisting>

If in doubt, always look for the .inf/.vxd drivers for Windows95. Windows95 doesn't ship with _ANY_ FIR drivers. (they are all third party, mostly from Counterpoint, who was assimilated by ESI)." 
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
   Also Thomas Davis found a package of small <emphasis>DOS utilities made
   by SMSC</emphasis>. Look at 

<!--

   tool is still available somewhere else).
-->
   <ulink url="ftp://ftp.smsc.com/pub/appsoftware/">IR_UTILS.ZIP</ulink>
   The package contains <command>FINDCHIP.EXE</command>. And includes a 
   <command>FIRSETUP.EXE</command> utility that is supposed to be 
   able to set all values except the chip address. Furthermore it contains 
   <command>BIOSDUMP.EXE</command>, which produces this output:

<title>IrDA and USB</title>

<para>
   The IrDA USB driver is included in recent 2.4 kernels. It's not as 
   efficient as    other FIR hardware, but at least is supported and 
   is relatively easy to get working. Also, all the current 
   products are based on the same hardware, and we know most of its bugs.
</para>

<para>
   As far as I know the Actisys 2000U and Extended System ESI-9685
   dongles seem to be based on the same hardware.
   Both USB dongles work fine with the Linux driver. It's possible to
   have multiple USB dongles in a box (for now, only up to 4).
</para>

<para>
   The latest version of the driver has been tested with 
   <command>usb-uhci</command> and <command>usb-ohci</command>.
   see also driver infos in src e.g. USB 2.0
</para>

<para>
   There is an USB IrDA Bridge Device spec at Rev 0.9B , it's being
   adopted as an USB class specification. You can find it at under 0.9
   Class Specification header at
   <ulink url="http://www.usb.org">USB.org</ulink>
   .
</para>

<para>
   Recently a new type of USB dongle from SigmaTel has appeared on
   the market which is _not_ compliant with the IrDA-USB
   specification, and therefore doesn't work with this driver. On the
   other hand, SigmaTel has made available the 
   <ulink url="http://www.sigmatel.com/technical_docs.htm#wireless">full technical specification</ulink>
   , so writing a driver for it is possible.

<title>Prerequisites</title>

<para>
   You need a kernel with appropriate IrDA and USB support and the standard
   entries in 
   <filename>/etc/modprobe.conf</filename> (kernel 2.6)
   <filename>/etc/modules.conf</filename> (kernel 2.4)
   and devices in
   <filename>/dev/ir*</filename> as described in the chapters above.
   And a second IrDA device whether with Linux inside or not, e.g. a
   laptop, a printer or a cell phone with IrDA port.
</para>

<para>
   You need a working USB controller. Check whether the appropriate module
   is already inserted with <command>lsmod</command>. If not you may insert
   it with <command>modprobe usb-uhci</command> (for Intel/Via USB controllers)
   or <command>modprobe usb-ohci</command> (for other USB controllers)
</para>

<para>
   Note: this driver has NOT been tested with the <command>usb-ehci</command>
   driver (for USB 2.0 controllers). This driver WON'T WORK with the 
   <command>uhci</command> driver (alternate/JE driver for Intel/Via USB controllers).
</para>

<warning>
<para>
   Note that there is another USB IrDA driver ( provided by the
   <ulink url="http://www.linux-usb.org">Linux USB Project</ulink>)
   for those devices called
   <command>ir-usb</command>. This module is NOT compatible with the IrDA stack
   and conflicts with <command>irda-usb</command>. Because it
   always loads first, you have to remove <command>ir-usb</command> completely.
</para>

<para>
   If you are not familiar with routing issues, I dare to recommend to
   shut down all external network interfaces with <command>ifconfig</command>
   during the first set up. Then check with <command>route -n</command>. Also
   netfiltering (iptables) may cause problems, so if you are not connected
   to a network you may disable it.
</para>

<para>
   I have described the process in every detail, to make every caveat
   as clear as possible. The actual configuration is much shorter and easier. 
   During configuration I will choose to open three different
   terminal windows to watch the log messages from different programs.

   Some note about the configuration: Yes the device name is correct, 
   don't choose an USB device here. If the other IrDA device is a Linux laptop
   you may use the same configuration file and the same PPP options,
   without the last line, which sets
   the LOCAL and REMOTE IP address. The following entries are for debugging purposes

   and configure the system V init scripts (for IrDA, network, ..). But the 
   way to do it right depends on your Linux distribution.

   All of these have an infrared port.

</para>

<para>
   The following is based on my experience with the 
   <ulink url="http://www.sharp-world.com/">SHARP</ulink>
   Zaurus SL-5500G, with the original SHARP romimage 2.38G and 
   Kernel 2.4.6-rmk1-np2-embedix#1,
   but may be applied mutatis mutandis to other Linux PDAs.
   The Zaurus comes with a written manual, where beaming files and PPP connections
   are explained using the GUI (e.g. FileManager, Settings). 
   Here I will try to cover what can be done
   from the command line and topics neither included in the official SHARP manual nor the
   <ulink url="http://www.rit.edu/~tfs1812/opieusermanual/book1.htm">Opie User Manual</ulink>
   <!--
   <ulink url="http://opie.handhelds.org/usermanual/book1.htm">Opie User Manual</ulink>

   .
   The infrared functions seem to be part of the StrongARM SA1110 CPU, the
   IrDA driver module is named <command>sa1110_ir</command> (on the stock
   Zaurus IrDA support seems to be built into the Kernel). From the
   <command>irda-utils</command> only <command>irattach</command> is
   available. IrDA support is attached via <command>irattach /dev/ttyS2 -s 1</command>
   (note "-s 1" will be replaced by "-s" with newer versions). So it looks like 
   SIR is used, I don't have information about FIR support yet.
   To get some of the functionality of <command>irdadump</command> and
   detect other IrDA devices in range or debug IrDA you may use 
   <command>cat /proc/net/irda/discovery</command> and the other 
   files in the <filename>/proc</filename> filesystem or compile
   the <command>irda-utils</command> for the ARM archictecture by yourself,
   also pre-compiled binaries are available.
   From the device files only <filename>/dev/ircomm</filename> (note 
   it's not <filename>/dev/ircomm0</filename>) is
   created by default. The file <filename>modules.conf</filename> doesn't
   seem to exist. With <command>irrecv</command> you may start the infrared
   GUI settings. IrOBEX support is available, but the appropriate tools from
   <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openobex/">OpenOBEX</ulink>
   are missing, but you may beam files to a Palm PDA, cell phone or
   another Linux box or a Microsoft-Windows machine from the GUI.
   The IrDA startup scripts lives in <filename>/home/etc/rc.d/init.d/irda</filename>.
   For infrared remote control support see below.
   With <command>irdadump</command> from another Linux box the Zaurus

   Now start PPP with <command>pppd call irda</command> on both machines.

<title>Beaming Files - OpenOBEX</title>

<para>
   The advantage of OBEX is usually the integration. Send an
   appointement event over OBEX, and most likely the Zaurus will
   integrate that in the built-in calendar automagically, like the Palm
   does. Same for business cards.
   The IrOBEX protocol offers an easy way to beam files via infrared
   to another PDA, a cell phone or computer. The
   Linux tools are provided by
   <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openobex/">OpenOBEX</ulink>
   . Beaming via the GUI between two Zaurus PDAs or to a Palm PDA might
   work. But currently I couldn't send or receive files from my Linux laptop.
   When trying to send a file per <command>ircp FILE</command>, I get this
   <command>irdadump</command> message:

   Jean Tourrilhes suggests this solution:
   "The Zaurus doesn't support the "OBEX:IrXfer" service, it
   probably only supports the "OBEX" service use 
   <command>cat /proc/net/irda/irias</command> to verify.
   So, either you start a server on "OBEX:IrXfer" on the Zaurus,
   (<command>ircp_server</command> - cross compiled for Zaurus), 
   or you use a client using "OBEX" on the 
   laptop (<command>irobex_palm3</command>)."

   (ftp://ftp.handhelds.org/pub/linux/dists/familiar/feeds/unstable/packages/armv4l/).
   It can talk to most handhelds/laptops/printers which use the IrDA Object
   Exchange protocol (OBEX), in fact any device which already works with
   the openobex package will work with this.
   
   It should be fairly intuitive to use. Make sure that IrDA is 'On',
   position the two devices, wait for the status bar to show that a new
   peer has been discovered, choose the transfer mode (use 'Palm3' for
   PalmOS peers and 'Windows' for everything else) then press 'beam' or
   'receive' as appropriate. Note that 'receive' toggles on and off.

   Tested transfers to and from this IrDA devices: an old Palm3,
   a Psion 5MX, a Windows 98 ThinkPad and a Linux desktop with an Actisys
   L220+ dongle.

   The ObexFTP implementation 
   <ulink url="http://triq.net/obexftp">flexmem</ulink>
   accesses the Flex.Memory directly. I piped a S45 data
   explorer (windows) session through sersniff.
   The log looks roughly like OBEX over cable. In fact old Open OBEX is working
   with the Siemens S45 mobile phone.
   It is confirmed to work well with Siemens S45/ME45 and similar mobile phones.
   You may access the Flex Memory on Siemens mobile equipment via IrDA or

<title>Printing</title>

<para>
   To print directly to an IrDA capable printer you need the device
   file <filename>/dev/irlpt0</filename>. If it's not available, use
   <command>mknod /dev/irlpt0 c 161 16</command> to create it.
   Now you may perform a first and simple test.
   Try to write a small file to <filename>/dev/irlpt0</filename> by 
   <command>cat FILE &gt;/dev/irlpt0</command>. With the stock Kernel
   from SHARP this didn't work, but with a custom kernel it worked fine.
   Do not wonder about a bad format (the lines form sort of steps)
   this is just a first check.
   To get a pretty print format you may have to write a filter
   as described in the Printing-HOWTO from
   <ulink url="http://www.linuxprinting.org">LinuxPrinting.org</ulink>

   <ulink url="http://www.uv-ac.de/ipaqhelp/">iPAQ Help - iPAQ and Zaurus development using QPE</ulink>
   by Werner Schulte desribes how to develope Qtopia applications in general.
</para>

<!--
* <ulink url="http://www.zauruszone.com/howtos/irda_howto.shtml">Z-IRDA-HOWTO</ulink>
* Howto utilize the irda port on the Zaurus
* 1) Intro
* On the left hand side of the Sharp Zaurus a IrDa port is located. The IrDa port is not very powerfull and only can go
* a few feet at most. A repeater can be used for more fun irda hacking (but that is a separate howto).
* 2) Basics
* At this time applications can utilize the IrDa port if they are developed with Qt. (If someone know how to use it via
* java etc please send an e-mail to the address at the top.)
* Using the irda port is as simple as creating an object and calling send.
* Ir *testIr = new Ir(this, "TestIrObject");
* testIr->send("/proc/uptime", "Uptime file", "text/plain");
* You can send files or DocLnk files.  See the documentation that came with the qpe sdk for more detailed information.
* 3) Issues
* When using the function:
* void send( const QString & fn, const QString & description, const QString & mimetype = QString::null )
* You must set the mimetype if the file doesn't have an extension otherwise the irda transfer will crash the other
* Zaurus and cause it to reboot.
* The signal:
* done( Ir * irda )
* Is not implemented and shouldn't be used.
* The static meathod:
* bool Ir::supported()
* at the time of this writing isn't supported and will always return true, but the applications should still call this
* for a future binary that will have a working version of this function.
* 4) Example
* Download example source and binary irda demo app in a tar.gz file here.
* Simply copy the "ir" executable over to the Zaurus and run it from the command line.
* The gui test program allows for either sending text or a file to another Zaurus. The source is included in the tar.gz
* for further review and exploration.

   If answer, keep the same config, if no answer, try next config
   Discovery 2: send 6 xid frames with 80 ms separation

   esound server (esd) on your machine. Both my machines, a 166Mhz
   Pentium laptop and a 200Mhz Pentium Pro cannot run Linux/IrDA when
   esd is running. The reason is that esd makes the soundcard give
   interrups over 300 times/second which makes the serial driver
   overrun when receiving. This is because the serial driver now uses
   slow interrupts in Linux-2.2 (everything is slow interrupts in
   2.2), so the interrupt-handler schedules on its way out. The good
   thing about slow interrupts is that packets are delivered much
   faster, since you don't need to wait for the next timer-tick. The
   only exception for this is the pc87108 driver which works fine
   since it uses DMA and will only give a couple of interrupts per

   For some ThinkPad models you have to reboot to the preinstalled M$ OS
   and activate the IrDA port using the Thinkpad tools. There is
   currently no Linux tool to achieve that. This will disable your
   internal serial port (ttyS0)!. The DOS tool is <command>PS2.EXE</command>, as far as I
   know <command>tpctl</command> doesn't achieve this. It is really important to use this
   DOS program to enable IrDA. Using the Microsoft-Windows tools does not
   work. Without that the driver loads correctly and everythings seems
   OK, but the LED does not light bright enough.

   <command>scanport</command> can be used to get the

   usual ISA range. Above 0x400 there are shadows of below 0x400 devices,
   and beyond that there are PCI devices, so the default is not to scan
   above 0x400. "Anyway, I had to manually scan using inb to find my
   chip's I/O. Fortunately I didn't have to go far to find it. (Newer
   sound cards often sit at 0x530ish, with 0x220 reserved for legacy
   compatibility modes) Normally, if you know where some device is
   located you just point the driver at it and the driver probes to see
   if it's the device the driver is expecting. Not entirely safe, but
   much safer than every driver probing every I/O port looking for
   something it thinks it can understand. scanport only does reads, which

   : " In some cases it may be desired to
   increase link distance beyond the 1 meter guaranteed by IrDA. The two
   ways to do this are to increase transmitted light intensity, or to
   increase receiver sensitivity. In order to extend the link distance,
   both sensitivity and intensity must be increased for both ends of the
   IR link. If it is desired to communicate with a standard IrDA device
   that may have minimum transmitter intensity, the receiver intensity
   must be increased. The standard IrDA device may also have minimum
   receiver sensitivity, so transmitter intensity must also be
   increased."

   Also laser diodes (pulsable) were recommended by K-H. Eischer: But they
   are more expensive. And the laser diodes are also dangerous if they
   have more than 1 mW. A better solution would be to use lenses to focus
   the beam. There is a minimum of absorbtion in the air (I don't know
   the right frequency) and you should use IR diodes with this frequency.

   It's in two parts (you may only need one your milage may vary...) the
   first called irdaipcfg does the following:
</para>

<para>
   1) First part is executed as irdaipcfg ifeth ifirlan daemonizes, then
   looks for ARP packets on ifirlan, checks that the arp was not
   generated by the machine on which it is running. The arp contains the
   ip address of the machine on the other end of the irlan (it was
   generated by the gratuatous arp in the irlan code). The program then
   sets up a host route to this ip address via ifirlan, adds a proxy arp
   to ifeth for it and generates a gratuatous arp on ifeth. It writes the
   ip address of the client in /var/run/host.ifirlan so you can easily
   undo all of this from a script.

   2) Second part is executed as gratarp ifirlan. Sometimes the
   gratuatous arp seems to get lost in the pipe work, gratarp daemonizes

<!--

   Can anyone comment on the availability
   of ipv6 for IR based devices? Would/Does
   this work over IRLAN ? If not, would it
   sit solely on an IRLap implementation?
   
         Your best bet is probably IrNET, but IrLAN may work as well.
   
   Also, can anyone comment on whether
   the ipv6 autoconfiguration model would
   work for intermittent contact with various
   IR dongles?
   
           It depend what is your definition of "work". For simplistic

   Answer by Dag Brattli: "Could you all check if the same thing is

   So here you have your own little kernel project. Start adding APM
   support to irport which will be the easiest thing (and also to the FIR
   drivers), then you can start adding a patch to the serial driver (if
   needed). Again I think the PCMCIA subsystem may be a good source on
   how to fix it properly."

<title>Existing IrDA Protocol Implementations</title>

<para>
   From Lichen Wang I have taken these remarks:
</para>

<para>
   IrLAP, IrLMP, and TinyTP are pretty stable now. But various individual
   implementations may still have quirks.
</para>

<para>
   IrCOMM is widely used, but Microsoft vowed to drop it and use IrSocket
   only.
</para>

<para>
   IrObex, IrMC, IrTran-P, etc. are showing up in various devices. The
   supports on PC are segmented and sometimes very poor.
</para>

<para>
New IrDA Protocol Development

   AIR is pushed mainly by IBM. You get wider angle and longer distance
   (10M?) but may be at lower data rate. You can also time-multiplex this
   already slow channel. In my opinion the benefit to the user is very
   little. AIR hardware and software changes are costly. I think you will
   have to wait for a long time, if ever, to see any product using AIR.
</para>

<para>
   IrBUS is pushed mainly by Sharp. It is aimed at remote control, IR
   keyboard, etc., not for data communication. I think if Sharp succeed,
   you may see IrBUS in set-top boxes, web-tv, etc. If and when these
   devices reaches a critical mass, some PC may incorporate IrBUS in
   order to control these devices.
</para>

<para>
   VFIR is the latest. The benefit is higher data rate (16 Mbps). Unlike
   AIR and IrBUS, the software changes for VFIR are minimum. The changes
   are mainly in hardware.
</para>

<para>
   In summary, I do not think we need to wait in anticipation of new IrDA
   protocols. A easy to install and solid implementation of the existing
   IrDA protocols is the cutting edge!.

<para>

</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Answer:
   I never used irport because irtty works for me, but it
   should not matter which low level driver you use. I used successfully
   irtty, nsc-ircc and irda-usb (depending on my hardware).

<para>
   Q1 - Question: I do not know anything about ports and irqs. What
   should I do?
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Answer:
   PART A: Hardware settings
   - 1 Have a look at your hardware specs!!! If not available look at
   the support page of your vendor, or contact the support hotline.
   You might also find the information in one of the hardware surveys
   mentioned above.
<!--
   - 2 Use a current BIOS. Usually available at the support page of
   your vendor.
   - 3 Try setserial /dev/ttyS? -g -a | egrep 16550A. One of the
   shown devices is probably the one you are looking for. Usually it
   is the second one, but with no guarantee.
   - 4 Note: What seems like an UART is physically the IrDA
   controller. For my HP Omnibook 800 this is the VLSI VL82C147 PCI -
   IrDA controller. These controllers should behave up to 115 200 bps
   like UART's. But sometimes it is very difficult to get the right
   configuration.
-->
   PART B: How to tell the kernel about the hardware settings
   -4 cat /proc/ioports to see which ports are already in use.
   -5 cat /proc/interrupts to see which interrupts are already in
   use.
   -6 Make ports and interrupts available for use with the IR device,
   e.g. stop the PCMCIA service or include a line like this in
   /etc/sysconfig/pcmcia: PCIC_OPTS="irq_list=3,4,5,7,9,10,12,14,15"
   -7 Now try to guess what the right interrupt and port is. Use
   setserial /dev/ttySx irq M port 0xNNNN to tell the kernel. If
   there is more then one possible chance try them all (Note: As
   mentioned in the Serial-HOWTO you should not try irq 0, 1, 6, 8,
   13, 14).
   -8 If you were successful please send these parameters to the
   author, because I would like to include them in the Infrared
   Hardware Survey.
   -9 Good luck.
   It might also be necessary to fine tune the IR serial port with
   setserial, e.g., setserial /dev/ttyS0 spd_vhi (speed rate 115200).

</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Answer by Dag Brattli: Yes and no! One of the IrDA standard,
   IrCOMM permits you to emulate a serial cable between two laptops,
   so you can use any application written for serial ports
   (terminals, PPP, slip, etc.). This is however not yet implemented
   in Linux/IrDA. The IrLPT (printer) support is actually a subset of
   IrCOMM, so some of it is working!
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Q8 - Question by Ho Chin Keong: If I block the infrared path
   deliberately for more than 10 seconds, the connection could not
   re-establish. I have to kill the irattach and restart the whole
   procedure to start the infrared route. The connection could be
   maintained, however, if the blocking is less than 10 seconds. Is
   this part of the design or a bug? Is there any way whereby we can
   lengthen this time limit from 10 s to longer or infinitely?

   Answer by Thomas Davis: This seems to be a bug in the primary side
   of the IrLAP/IrLMP code. It appears not to send the
   reset/disconnect notice all the way back up the stack. You'll
   notice it when IrLPT gets stuck in the query mode while you were
   trying to talk to a printer, and disconnected/interrupted it when
   it was handshaking. (and now, it shows up in the IrLAN portion)

Q12 - By Rui Oliveira: I am having a problem connecting a PalmIII
   to a Linux box with an Actisys 220L adapter. With a motherboard
   adapter (no brand but, I think, similar to the Actisys 210L) I
   simply redirect a pilot syncronization tool (pilot-xfer) to
   /dev/ttyS1 which has the ir adapter attached and, using IrLink in
   SIR mode, I can get the Linux box to talk with the PalmIII. Trying
   the above through a serial port with a serial-irda Actisys 220L
   adapter I can't get this to work. My question is :What happens if
   one just throws data into a serial port with a irda adapter?

</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Answer by Lichen Wang: In terms of hardware, IrDA SIR needs a
   serializer- deserializer, an encoder-decoder, and a transceiver.
   The UART that drives the COM port of any PC is a
   serializer-deserializer. In some PC, there is also an
   encoder-decoder which can be enabled or disabled by the BIOS. When
   it is disabled, the COM port is usable as an old COM port. When
   the encoder-decoder is enabled, usually the COM port is no longer
   usable but an IrDA port is now usable instead. Actisys IR-210 is a
   SIR transceiver and thus can be used if the PC has this kind of
   UART with an IrDA encoder-decoder and the BIOS has enabled it.
   Under this hardware configuration, you need to tell the Windows
   setup program that you have "standard infrared devices" and with
   "Built-in Infrared port on laptop or desktop". Actisys IR-220, on
   the other hand, includes both the encoder-decoder and the
   transceiver. It is designed to be used with a regular UART. If the
   UART in the PC has also the encoder-decoder built-in, you must use
   BIOS to disable that. Under either of this hardware configuration,
   you need to tell the Windows setup program that you have an
   "ACTiSYS" manufactured "ACT-IR220L Infrared Wireless Interface".
   To answer your question: In addition to throwing data at the
   serial port, you need to tell the UART and the encoder-decoder
   what data rate to use. In the case of a built-in encoder-decoder,
   when you set the data rate of the UART, the encoder-decode also
   get set correctly. In the case a separate encoder-decoder, you
   need to tell both of them the data rate separatly.

Answer by Dag Brattli: If you still have Win95 on your machine,
   you should go to the device manager and change the PnP setup for
   the IrDA port (something else than the stuff your're already
   using). You could for example move away ttyS1 (in Win95), so that
   it uses the values that the PCMCIA card is going to steal, and
   then use the settings from ttyS1 for ttyS2.

<programlisting role="small">
dagbnb ~/linux/test/ &gt; cat /etc/sysconfig/pcmcia
PCMCIA=yes
PCIC=i82365
PCIC_OPTS="irq_list=7,9,10"

</programlisting>

   ... should make sure the PCMCIA controller stays away from irq 11.
   Also make sure that the IrDA port is enabled in Win95 since it's
   disabled by default.

<title>Infrared Remote Control ./. IrDA</title>

<para>
   Two of the above mentioned projects use some kind of selfmade dongle
   for infrared remote control. There is also a description to build a
   serial IrDA dongle by yourself in the German 
   <ulink url="http://www.elektor.de">ELEKTOR</ulink> 5/97 p. 28
   magazine. Maybe someone can merge these two kind of dongles together.
</para>

<para>
   For a discussion of the relation between Infrared Remote Control and
   IrDA I quote from the Linux/IrDA mailing list (shortend and modified
   by WH):
</para>

<para>
   Ryan Shillington wrote: "ConsumerIR - CIR, Remote IR and ASK-IR are 
   very different from IrDA (FIR, MIR, SIR).
</para>

<para>
   Remote IR and ASK-IR are very low speed and low frequency (but very
   long range) uses for IR. They operate around 2400 baud.
</para>

<para>
   SIR operates at higher rates, and is meant for long range transmission
   where you need more than a few characters pass through (unlike a
   remote control).
</para>

<para>
   MIR is a little faster (less range), but with speeds up to 1.15 Mbps,
   and FIR (where the devices have to be practically touching) is 4Mbps.
   The range is inversely proportional to the speed you can send data at.
</para>

<para>
   I'm working on drivers for Remote-IR, but you should know that your IR
   stuff has to support it. Look for protocols like NEC, RC-5 or RC-0
   (those are the most common ones).
</para>

<para>
   You can use SIR to receive Remote Control signals. Set your baud rate
   nice and low and data will come through. BUT, from my experience, it's
   not the RIGHT data. It's not being analyzed in the right way, and as
   such, you can't compute the checksums or check it with its complement.
</para>

<para>
   I have managed to get data in (using SIR) with remote controls. I have
   been told that SIR will read the remote control stuff differently
   depending on temperature (although I have never had that experience).
   "
</para>

<para>
   Lichen Wang wrote in response: "The so-called
   ASKIR in most laptops etc. is not meant for remote IR devices. ASKIR
   is meant for Sharp Wizard and Zaurus PDAs and some of Sharp's notebook
   PCs. Sharp stated this long before IrDA was established and is still
   supporting it to maintain backward compatibility. Apple's Newton had
   this capability at one time, too.
</para>

<para>
   Briefly, ASKIR uses 9.6 Kbps (19.2 and 38.4 Kbps are also possible)
   asynchronous data format of 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and odd parity.
   The start bit as well as all 0 bit in data/parity are transmitted as
   IR square wave at 500 KHz (DASK sub-carrier). The stop bit as well as
   all 1 bit in data/parity are represented by the absence of any IR
   transmission.
</para>

<para>
   As you can see, this is totally incompatible with existing IR remote
   control. [..]
</para>

<para>
   True. Not only can you use SIR hardware to receive, you can transmit,
   too. Of course, there are some limitations.
</para>

<para>
   Most IR remote controls use 38 KHz sub-carrier. 3 times 38 is 114,
   very close to 115.2. You can set the UART to operate at 115.2 Kbps, 7
   data bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit - a total of 9 bits. Each 3
   cycles of the 38 KHz sub-carrier can be received or transmitted as a
   byte of 0x5B.
</para>

<para>
   There are some physical limitations in addition to the fact that the
   sub-carrier must be 38 KHz. The SIR receiver is not as sensitive to 38
   KHz as the IR remote receiver designed for that. The SIR transmitter
   has a much lower duty cycle and thus can not emit a strong sub-carrier
   either.
</para>

<para>
   IR remote encodes the control signal by turning on and off the
   sub-carrier at certain specific patterns. Now that you can transmit
   and receive the sub-carrier, what remains is all in timing.
</para>

<para>
   For transmit, you have to know how many consecutive bytes of 0x5B to
   send for each burst of the sub-carrier, and how long to be quiet
   between the bursts.
</para>

<para>
   For receive, you have to know how many of the 0x5Bs you received are
   consecutive, and how long the gaps were between these groups of
   consecutive bytes. [..]
</para>

<para>
   My experience with the IrDA link distance of SIR, MIR and FIR is
   somewhat different from what Ryan said. [..]
</para>

<para>
   SIR, MIR and FIR should all work from 0 to 100 cm but in practice:
</para>

<para>
   (a) Some devices may have problems at LONG distances.
</para>

<para>
   When possible, place the two communicating devices no more than 50 cm
   apart. Low power devices, such as pagers, phones, etc. may have even
   shorter ranges despite the fact that they use SIR instead of MIR or
   FIR.
</para>

<para>
   (b) Some devices may have problems at SHORT distances.
</para>

<para>
   Place the two devices at least a few cm apart. Putting the two devices
   too close to each other can cause troubles.
</para>

<para>
   It is somewhat intuitive that when the link is not reliable we put the
   two devices closer together. But it is counterintuitive that too close
   is not good either. The reason is that the light intensity at 1 cm is
   10.000 times brighter than that at 100 cm. At 0.5 cm, it is 40.000
   times, etc. The IR receiver manufacturers have difficulties to cover
   this huge dynamic range. We all have problems reading under a 10 W
   light bulb, but imagine how it feels under a 100.000 W light!
</para>

<para>
   The IrDA Physical Layer is totally incompatible with the DASK
   modulation used in IR remote controls. Thus it is not possible to use
   the same controller function for both FIR and remote control. However,
   practically all FIR controller chips do include some additional
   functions to support remote control. National, SMC, and Winbond (just
   to name a few) all have such I/O chips.
</para>

<para>
   The IR transmitter for FIR and remote control are very similar. I have
   tried a standard FIR transmitter. It can reach 10 meters for remote
   control purpose. Thus it performs just as good as transmitters
   designed for remote control.
</para>

<para>
   The IR receiver for FIR and remote control are somewhat different. A
   FIR receiver can receive remote control signals but can reach only 1
   meter whereas receivers designed for remote control typically can
   reach 10 meters.
</para>

<para>
   I have an ISA bus adapter with a National I/O chip that supports both
   FIR and remote control. I also have IR Dongles that include both FIR
   and remote control receivers. (Plus a transmitter for both modes.) I
   cannot find any software to support remote control functions. I did my
   own experiments in DOS (I cannot run Linux yet.) Anybody interest in
   this? "

   ASKIR. The mode of the infrared port can be switched to ASKIR in the

   Dag Brattli wrote: It should be possible to use IrControl (formerly
   IrBus) for IrDA compliant remote controls. I currently don't know
   about any remote controls using IrControl standard, but there should
   be some out there (anyone else who knows better?). You should go to the
   <ulink url="http://www.irda.org/">IrDA</ulink> site and get the 
   physical layer standard (which includes IrControl I think).
</para>

<para>
   "Normal" IrDA (using IrLAP) is _not_ well suited for remote control
   because of the connection oriented nature (and just supports 9600bps
   for connectionless use). The reason for the limited range is
   eye-safety they say (but I currently don't know why CIR works better
   using the same power). I have however seen laptops connect at 4-5
   meters (but I don't think that any high speed communication would be
   possible).
</para>

<para>
   Most IrDA chipsets are capable of CIR operation, and it is quite easy
   to modify the drivers so they talk CIR. Takahide Higuchi has started
   to look at IrSockets and it would be great if we could open a "raw"
   Ir(DA) socket which then could send and receive CIR packets. Then all
   the CIR applications could live in userspace.
</para>

<para>
   I know that Corel is interested in using CIR for controlling the
   NetWinder (and they actually have running code). Take a look at

</para>

<para>
   Fortunately, many IrDA devices are compatible with the 38-kbps ASK
   modulation used in TV remotes. This means that they can work with such
   kind of infrared type signals. ... However, it seems that there are
   still many portable computers that can't receive TV infrared stuff.
</para>

<para>
   For desktop computers, there exist two options, depending on the
   motherboard you have. Usually a Pentium MoBo has an I/O chipset ready
   for infrared communication. There is a special connector where you can
   connect the transducer. The other option is buying a serial type
   transceiver that connects to the standard serial port (RS-232) of the
   computer. ... PC Remote Control has been tested with success using
   both type of IrDA devices:
</para>

<para>
   1) IRmate IR-210 Serial Port Infrared Adapter. ... The serial port
   speed at wich the device sends recognizable data values is 2400 bps. I
   don't know if this speed will be the same for all the adapters of this
   type or is an unique characteristic of this model.
</para>

<para>
   Look at the examples of data values received to see how similar are
   them. There are some infrared commands that change a lot every time,
   difficulting the recognition. In such cases, a great tolerance in the
   comparison could be used, but the risk of confusion between different
   commands will be increased. An apropiate tolerance value for almost
   all cases is 20.
</para>

<para>
   2) Actisys IR2000L connected to an Asus P2B motherboard. ... There are
   several serial port speeds that work well, although 4800 bps seems to
   be the best one. Other adapters of this same type work also well using
   this speed. Take a look at the samples of data sequences received
   using this device. Some remote buttons send exactly the same sequence
   and it's impossible to distinguish between them at all.
</para>

<para>
   3) Asus IR-eye connected to the same MoBo as above. It works as well
   as the Actisys device.
</para>

<para>
   TV remotes send commands only one way, in a low-speed burst for
   distances of up to 30 feet. They use directed IR with LEDs that have a
   moderate cone angle to improve ease-of-use characteristics. Cordless
   connectivity via IrDA transfers files, point-to-point and
   bidirectionally, in a high-speed burst for short distances using
   directed IR with LEDs having a narrow cone angle. IrDA transmissions
   require relatively careful aiming, and they're easy to block. For this
   reason, don't expect a great distance while working with the remote
   unit.

   Answer by Dag Brattli: "You are talking about being normal serial
   ports, but that is something at least I have choosen IrDA not to be. I
   have implemented all the device drivers as network device drivers, so
   things are a bit different (more frame oriented). The device drivers
   deliver IrDA frames and currently nothing else.
</para>

<para>
   But I don't think that we must have a tty interface to the IrDA device
   drivers in order to support more RAW reads and writes. And btw. forget
   about IrCOMM, it has nothing to do with this issue.
</para>

<para>
   I have actually already implemented support for raw reads and writes
   for the device drivers, since some of the dongles require this."

<title>Infrared Light and Eye Safety</title>

<para>
   This section summarizes some ideas and thoughts that were exchanged on the
   Linux/IrDA mailing list. It is not medically well-founded, and whoever has
   better evidence or some more well-founded source of information is
   encouraged to contribute it to this HOWTO.
</para>

<para>
   The IrDA spec says that the range of IrDA devices has been limited to 1m for
   reasons of eye safety. Another plausible assumption is that power
   consumption and IR pollution/crosstalk were reasons for this limitation. In
   principle there could be danger for the eye, because infrared light is not
   registered by the eye, and thus the pupil won't close in order to protect
   the retina from bright IR light sources. This is the same situation as with
   UV light, which will cause snow blindness eventually, but in contrast to UV
   light, IR light contains much less harmful energy due to its longer
   wavelength.
</para>

<para>
   The only legal restrictions and medical advices we were able to find on
   the web were concerned with infrared emissions of heat lamps or in the
   welding process and IEC 825-1 (CENELEC EN60825-1). This suggests that IR
   light as emitted by IrDA devices will be harmless, since even the peak
   power emitted by strong IR LEDs (ca. 300mW) is several orders of
   magnitude below the power emitted by medical IR heat lamps (up to 500W).
   For these, however, you are supposed to wear protective goggles, so
   maybe if you are looking straight into 1.000 infrared LEDs flashing at
   once, you should do so, too. The effect of infrared light is mostly
   heat, though, and not an alteration or destruction of the biological
   cell structure, such as caused by UV light. Though in the specs for the
   HP OmniBook 800 Hewlett-Packard recommends not to look directly into the
   IR LED.
</para>

<para>
   As stated above, this discussion is only based on guesswork and common
   sense assumptions about the data found in IR LED and heat lamp specs.
   If anybody with a better medical knowledge can comment on this, please
   do so!

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</para>


<sect2>
<title>0. PREAMBLE</title>
<para>
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure
everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered
responsible for modifications made by others. 
</para>

<para>
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same
sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. 
</para>

<para>
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation:
a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to
software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>
<para>
This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you". 
</para>

<para>
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or
with modifications and/or translated into another language. 
</para>

<para>
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship
of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that
could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary
Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with
related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. 
</para>

<para>
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
notice that says that the Document is released under this License. 
</para>

<para>
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that
says that the Document is released under this License. 
</para>

<para>
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available
to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for
images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for
input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an
otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is
not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque". 
</para>

<para>
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML
produced by some word processors for output purposes only. 
</para>

<para>
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. 
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>2. VERBATIM COPYING</title>
<para>
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License,
the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.
If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. 
</para>

<para>
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>
<para>
If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover,
and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.
The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on
the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. 
</para>

<para>
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. 
</para>

<para>
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network
location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public
has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must
take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. 
</para>

<para>
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of
copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>4. MODIFICATIONS</title>
<para>
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that
you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these
things in the Modified Version: 
</para>

<para>
     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
     versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as
     a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
</para>

<para>
     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
     Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
     less than five).
</para>

<para>
     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. 
</para>

<para>
     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. 
</para>

<para>
     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. 
</para>

<para>
     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
     under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. 
</para>

<para>
     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
     license notice. 
</para>

<para>
     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. 
</para>

<para>
     I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
     publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section entitled "History" in the Document,
     create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item
     describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. 
</para>

<para>
     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document,
     and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in
     the "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the
     Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. 
</para>

<para>
     K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all
     the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. 
</para>

<para>
     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the
     equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. 
</para>

<para>
     M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. 
</para>

<para>
     N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. 
</para>

<para>
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add
their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other
section titles. 
</para>

<para>
You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
definition of a standard. 
</para>

<para>
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to
the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text
may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same
cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another;
but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. 
</para>

<para>
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</title>
<para>
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above
for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice. 
</para>

<para>
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a
single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section
unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
combined work. 
</para>

<para>
In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications". You must
delete all sections entitled "Endorsements." 
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</title>
<para>
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the
individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. 
</para>

<para>
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document. 
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</title>
<para>
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the other
self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
derivative works of the Document. 
</para>

<para>
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate. 
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>8. TRANSLATION</title>
<para>
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this License, the original English version will prevail. 
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>9. TERMINATION</title>

<para>
