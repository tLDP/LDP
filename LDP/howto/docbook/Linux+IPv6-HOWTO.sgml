I (<emphasis>Peter Bieringer</emphasis>) got a request in late November 2001 to rewrite the <ulink url="http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/">IPv6 & Linux - HowTo</ulink> in SGML. However, because of the discontinuation of that HOWTO (<ulink url="http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/IPv6-HOWTO/IPv6-HOWTO-0.html#history">Future of IPv6 & Linux - HowTo</ulink>), and as IPv6 is becoming more and more standard, I decided to write a new  document covering basic and advanced issues which will remain important over  the next few years.

<chapter id="chapter-basics"><title>Basics</title><sect1><title>What is IPv6?</title><para>IPv6 is a new layer 3 transport protocol (see <ulink url="http://www.linuxports.com/howto/intro_to_networking/c4412.htm#PAGE103HTML">linuxports/howto/intro_to_networking/ISO - OSI Model</ulink>) which will supersede IPv4 (also known as IP). IPv4 was designed long time ago (<ulink url="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc760.html">RFC 760 / Internet Protocol</ulink> from January 1980) and since its inception, there have been many requests for more addresses and enhanced capabilities. Major changes in IPv6 are the redesign of the header, including the increase of address size from 32 bits to 128 bits. Because layer 3 is responsible for end-to-end packet transport using packet routing based on addresses, it must include the new IPv6 addresses (source and destination), like IPv4.</para><para>For more information about the IPv6 history take a look at older IPv6 related RFCs listed e.g. at <ulink url="http://www.switch.ch/lan/ipv6/references.html">SWITCH IPv6 Pilot / References</ulink>.</para></sect1>

<sect2><title>In between</title><para>Because of lack of manpower, the IPv6 implementation in the kernel was unable to follow the discussed drafts or newly released RFCs. In October 2000, a project was started in Japan, called <ulink url="http://www.linux-ipv6.org/">USAGI</ulink>, whose aim was to implement all missing, or outdated IPv6 support in Linux. It tracks the current IPv6 implementation in FreeBSD made by the <ulink url="http://www.kame.net/">KAME project</ulink>. From time to time they create snapshots against current vanilla Linux kernel sources.</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>Current</title><para>Unfortunately, the <ulink url="http://www.linux-ipv6.org/">USAGI</ulink> patch is so big, that current Linux networking maintainers are unable to include it in the production source of the Linux kernel 2.4.x series. Therefore the 2.4.x series is missing some (many) extensions and also does not confirm to all current drafts and RFCs. This can cause some interoperability problems with other operating systems.</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>Future</title><para><ulink url="http://www.linux-ipv6.org/">USAGI</ulink> is now making use of the new Linux kernel development series 2.5.x to insert all of their current extensions into this development release. Hopefully the 2.6.x kernel series will contain a true and up-to-date IPv6 implementation.</para></sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1><title>How do IPv6 addresses look like?</title><para>As previously mentioned, IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long. This number of bits generates very high decimal numbers with up to 39 digits: </para><programlisting><![CDATA[2^128-1: 340282366920938463463374607431768211455
]]></programlisting><para>Such numbers are not really addresses that can be memorized. Also the IPv6 address schema is bitwise orientated (just like IPv4, but that's not often recognized). Therefore a better notation of such big numbers is hexadecimal. In hexadecimal, 4 bits (also known as &quot;nibble&quot;) are represented by a digit or character from 0-9 and a-f (10-15). This format reduces the length of the IPv6 address to 32 characters.</para><programlisting><![CDATA[2^128-1: 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
]]></programlisting><para>This representation is still not very convenient (possible mix-up or loss of single hexadecimal digits), so the designers of IPv6 chose a hexadecimal format with a colon as separator after each block of 16 bits. In addition, the leading &quot;0x&quot; (a signifier for hexadecimal values used in programming languages) is removed:</para><programlisting><![CDATA[2^128-1: ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff
]]></programlisting><para>A usable address (see address types later) is e.g.: </para><programlisting><![CDATA[3ffe:ffff:0100:f101:0210:a4ff:fee3:9566
]]></programlisting><para>For simplifications, leading zeros of each 16 bit block can be omitted: </para><programlisting><![CDATA[3ffe:ffff:0100:f101:0210:a4ff:fee3:9566  ->

]]></programlisting><para>One sequence of 16 bit blocks containing only zeroes can be replaced with &quot;::&quot;. But not more than one at a time, otherwise it is no longer a unique representation. </para><programlisting><![CDATA[3ffe:ffff:100:f101:0:0:0:1  ->  3ffe:ffff:100:f101::1
]]></programlisting><para>The biggest reduction is seen by the IPv6 localhost address: </para><programlisting><![CDATA[0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001  ->  ::1

<sect1><title>FAQ (Basics)</title><sect2><title>Why is the name IPv6 and not IPv5 as successor for IPv4?</title><para>On any IP header, the first 4 bits are reserved for protocol version. So theoretically a protocol number between 0 and 15 is possible:</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>4: is already used for IPv4</para></listitem><listitem><para>5: is reserved for the Stream Protocol (STP, <ulink url="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1819.html">RFC 1819 / Internet Stream Protocol Version 2</ulink>) (which never really made it to the public)</para></listitem></itemizedlist><para>The next free number was 6. Hence IPv6 was born!</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>IPv6 addresses: why such a high number of bits?</title><para>During the design of IPv4, people thought that 32 bits were enough for the world. Looking back into the past, 32 bits were enough until now and will perhaps be enough for another few years. However, 32 bits are not enough to provide each network device with a global address in the future. Think about mobile phones, cars (including electronic devices on its CAN-bus), toasters, refrigerators, light switches, and so on...</para><para>So designers have chosen 128 bits, 4 times more in length and 2^96 greater in size than in IPv4 today.</para><para>The usable size is smaller than it may appear however. This is because in the currently defined address schema, 64 bits are used for interface identifiers. The other 64 bits are used for routing. Assuming the current strict levels of aggregation (/48, /35, ...), it is still possible to &quot;run out&quot; of space, but hopefully not in the near future.</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>IPv6 addresses: why so small a number of bits on a new design?</title><para>While, there are (possibly) some people on the Internet who are thinking about IPv8 and IPv16, their design is far away from acceptance and implementation. In the meantime 128 bits was the best choice regarding header overhead and data transport. Consider the minimum Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) in IPv4 (576 octets) and in IPv6 (1280 octets), the header length in IPv4 is 20 octets (minimum, can increase to 60 octets with IPv4 options) and in IPv6 is 48 octets (fixed). This is 3.4 &percnt; of MTU in IPv4 and 3.8 &percnt; of MTU in IPv6. This means the header overhead is almost equal. More bits for addresses would require bigger headers and therefore more overhead. Also, consider the maximum MTU on normal links (like Ethernet today): it's 1500 octets (in special cases: 9k octets using Jumbo frames). Ultimately, it wouldn't be a proper design if 10 &percnt; or 20 &percnt; of transported data in a Layer-3 packet were used for addresses and not for payload.</para></sect2>

</chapter>
<chapter id="chapter-addresstypes"><title>Address types</title><para>Like IPv4, IPv6 addresses can be split into network and host parts using subnet masks.</para><para>IPv4 has shown that sometimes it would be nice, if more than one IP address can be assigned to an interface, each for a different purpose (aliases, multi-cast). To remain extensible in the future, IPv6 is going further and allows more than one IPv6 address to be assigned to an interface. There is currently no limit defined by an RFC, only in the implementation of the IPv6 stack (to prevent DoS attacks).</para><para>Using this large number of bits for addresses, IPv6 defines address types based on some leading bits, which are hopefully never going to be broken in the future (unlike IPv4 today and the history of class A, B, and C).</para><para>Also the number of bits are separated into a network part (upper 64 bits) and a host part (lower 64 bits), to facilitate auto-configuration.

Nowadays there exists a set of configuration and script files which do the job very well (never heard about real problems, but I don't know how many use the set. Because this configuration and scrips files are extended from time to time, they got their own HOWTO page: <ulink url="http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/IPv6-HOWTO/scripts/current/">IPv6-HOWTO/scripts/current</ulink>. Because I began my IPv6 experience using a Red Hat Linux 5.0 clone, my IPv6 development systems are mostly Red Hat Linux based now, it's kind a logic that the scripts are developed for this kind of distribution (so called <emphasis>historic issue</emphasis>). Also it was very easy to extend some configuration files, create new ones and create some simple hook for calling IPv6 setup during IPv4 setup.</para><para>Fortunately, in Red Hat Linux since 7.1 a snapshot of my IPv6 scripts is included, this was and is still further on assisted by Pekka Savola.</para><para>Mandrake since version 8.0 also includes an IPv6-enabled initscript package, but a minor bug still prevents usage (&quot;ifconfig&quot; misses &quot;inet6&quot; before &quot;add&quot;).</para><sect2><title>Test for IPv6 support of network configuration scripts</title><para>You can test, whether your Linux distribution contain support for persistent IPv6 configuration using my set.
