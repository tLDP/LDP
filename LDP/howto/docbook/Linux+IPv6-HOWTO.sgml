    <para>
     There exists a second one called <ulink url="http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/">IPv6 & Linux - HowTo</ulink> written by me (<emphasis>Peter Bieringer</emphasis>) in pure HTML. It was born April 1997 and the first English version was published in June 1997.

     Linux IPv6 HOWTO (this document)
    </title>
    <para>
     Because the <ulink url="http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/">IPv6 & Linux - HowTo</ulink> is written in pure HTML it's not really compatible with the <ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">Linux Documentation Project (LDP)</ulink>. I (<emphasis>Peter Bieringer</emphasis>) got a request in late November 2001 to rewrite the <ulink url="http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/">IPv6 & Linux - HowTo</ulink> in SGML. However, because of the discontinuation of that HOWTO (<ulink url="http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/IPv6-HOWTO/IPv6-HOWTO-0.html#history">Future of IPv6 & Linux - HowTo</ulink>) once IPv6 becomes more and more standard, I decided to write a new document covering basic and advanced issues which will remain important over the next years. Dynamic content will be still found further on in the second HOWTO (<ulink url="http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/">IPv6 & Linux - HowTo</ulink>).

   What is IPv6?
  </title>
  <para>
   IPv6 is a new layer 3 transport protocol (see <ulink url="http://www.linuxports.com/howto/intro_to_networking/c4412.htm#PAGE103HTML">linuxports/howto/intro_to_networking/ISO - OSI Model</ulink>) which will supersede IPv4 (also known as IP). IPv4 was designed long time ago (<ulink url="http://rfc.net/rfc760.html">RFC 760</ulink> from January 1980) and since its incantation, there were many requests for more addresses and enhanced capabilities. Major changes in IPv6 are the redesign of the header, including the increase of address size from 32 bits to 128 bits. Because the layer 3 is responsible for end-to-end packet transport using packet routing based on addresses, it must include the new IPv6 addresses (source and destination), like IPv4.
  </para>
  <para>
   For more information about the IPv6 history take a look at older IPv6 related RFCs listed e.g. at <ulink url="http://www.switch.ch/lan/ipv6/references.html">SWITCH IPv6 Pilot / References</ulink>.

    Beginning
   </title>
   <para>
    The first IPv6 related network code was added to the Linux kernel 2.1.8 in November 1996 by Pedro Roque. It was based on the BSD API:

    In between
   </title>
   <para>
    Because of lack of manpower, the IPv6 implementation in the kernel couldn't follow the discussed drafts or newly released RFCs. In October 2000, a project was started in Japan, called <ulink url="http://www.linux-ipv6.org/">USAGI</ulink>, whose aim was to implement all missing or outdated IPv6 support in Linux, tracking the current IPv6 implementation in FreeBSD made by the <ulink url="http://www.kame.net/">KAME project</ulink>. From time to time they created snapshot against current vanilla Linux kernel sources.
   </para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2>
    <title>
    Current
   </title>
   <para>
    Unfortunately, the <ulink url="http://www.linux-ipv6.org/">USAGI</ulink> patch is so big, that current Linux networking maintainers aren't able to include it in the production source of the Linux kernel 2.4.x series. Therefore the 2.4.x series misses some (many) extensions and also didn't fulfill all current drafts and RFCs. This can cause some interoperability problems with other operating systems.
   </para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2>
    <title>
    Future
   </title>
   <para>
    <ulink url="http://www.linux-ipv6.org/">USAGI</ulink> now makes use of the new Linux kernel development series 2.5.x to put all their current extensions into this development release. Hopefully the 2.6.x kernel series will contain a true and up-to-date IPv6 implementation.
   </para>
   </sect2>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
   <title>
   How do IPv6 addresses look like?
  </title>
  <para>
   As said, IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long. This number of bits can cause very high decimal numbers with up to 39 digits: 
  </para>
  <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [2^{128}-1: 340282366920938463463374607431768211455
]]>  </programlisting>
  <para>
   &quot;Such numbers are not really addresses that can be memorized. Also the IPv6 address schema is bitwise orientated (just like IPv4, but that's not often recognized). Therefore a better notation of such big numbers is hexadecimal. In hexadecimal, 4 bits (also known as &quot;nibble&quot;) are represented by a digit or char from 0-9 and a-f (10-15) and reduces the length to 32 chars.
  </para>
  <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [2^{128}-1: 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
]]>  </programlisting>
  <para>
   This representation is also not very convenient (possible mix-up or loss of single hexadecimal digits), so the designers of IPv6 chose a hexadecimal format with a colon as separator after each block of 16 bits. In addition, the leading &quot;0x&quot; (a signifier for hexadecimal values used in programming languages) is removed:

    Why is the name IPv6 and not IPv5 as successor for IPv4?
   </title>
   <para>
    On any IP header, the first 4 bits are reserved for protocol version. So theoretically a protocol number between 0 and 15 is possible:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
    <para>
    4: is already used for IPv4
    </para>
   </listitem>

    <para>
    5: is reserved for the Stream Protocol (STP, <ulink url="http://rfc.net/rfc1819.html">RFC 1819</ulink>) (which never really made it to the public)
    </para>

    So the next free number was 6.

    IPv6 addresses: why such a high number of bits?
   </title>
   <para>
    During the design of IPv4, people thought that 32 bits were enough for the world. Looking back into the past, 32 bits were enough until now and will perhaps be enough for another couple years. However, 32 bits are not not enough to provide each network device with a global address in the future. Think about mobile phones, cars (including electronic devices on its CAN-bus), toasters, refrigerators, light switches, and so on...
   </para>
   <para>
    So designers have chosen 128 bit, 4 times more in length and 2^96 in size than in IPv4 today.
   </para>
   <para>
    But the usable size is smaller than it may appear, because in the currently defined address schema, 64 bits are user for interface identifiers. The other 64 bits are used for routing. Assuming the current strict levels of aggregation (/48, /35, ...), it's still possible to &quot;run out&quot; of space, but surely not in the near future.
   </para>
   </sect2>

    <title>
    IPv6 addresses: why so small a number of bits on a new design?
   </title>
   <para>
    Well, there is one (or more?) people on the Internet who think about IPv8 and IPv16, but their design is far away from acceptance and implementation.
   </para>
   <para>
    128 bit was the best choice regarding header overhead and data transport. Think about the minimum Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) in IPv4 (576 octets) and in IPv6 (1280 octets), the header length in IPv4 is 20 octets (minimum, can increase to 60 octets with IPv4 options) and in IPv6 is 48 octets (fixed). This is 3.4 &percnt; of MTU in IPv4 and 3.8 &percnt; of MTU in IPv6. This means the header overhead is nearly equal. More bits for addresses would require bigger headers and therefore more overhead. Also think about the maximum MTU on normal links (like Ethernet today): it's 1500 octets (in special cases: 9k octets using Jumbo frames). Ultimately, it wouldn't be a proper design if 10 &percnt; or 20 &percnt; of transported data in a Layer-3 packet were used for addresses and not for payload...

  Address types
 </title>
 <para>
  Like IPv4, IPv6 addresses can be split into network and host parts using subnet masks.
 </para>
 <para>
  IPv4 has shown that sometimes it would be nice, if more than one IP address can be assigned to an interface, each for a different purpose (aliases, multi-cast). 
 </para>
 <para>
  To remain extensible in the future, IPv6 is going further and allows more than one IPv6 address assigned to an interface. There is currently no limit defined by an RFC, only in the implementation of the IPv6 stack (to prevent DoS attacks).
 </para>
 <para>
  Using this big number of bits for addresses, IPv6 defines address types based on some leading bits, which are hopefully never going to be broken in the future (unlike IPv4 today and the history of class A, B, and C).
 </para>
 <para>
  Also the number of bits are separated into a network part (upper 64 bits) and a host part (lower 64 bits), to facilitate auto-configuration .

    Another advantage: because it's possible to assign more than one address to an interface with IPv6, you can also assign such a site local address in addition to a global one.

It replaces the upper 104 bits with &quot;ff02:0:0:0:0:1:ff00::/104&quot; and let the least 24 bits exist.

     This is already known, and a solution was designed: privacy extension, defined in <ulink url="http://rfc.net/rfc3041.html">RFC 3041 / Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6</ulink> (there is also already a newer draft available: <ulink url="ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/">draft-ietf-ipngwg-temp-addresses-*.txt</ulink>). Using a random and a static value a new suffix is generated from time to time. Note: this is only reasonable for outgoing client connections and isn't really useful for well-known servers.

    Manually set

   <para>
    For servers it's perhaps easier to remember simpler addresses, but that's also accounted for. It's possible to assign (additionally) another IPv6 address to an interface, e.g. 
   </para>
   <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [3ffe:ffff:100:f101::1
]]>   </programlisting>
   <para>
    For manual suffixes like &quot;::1&quot; shown in the above example it's required that the 6th most significant bit is set to 0 (the universal/local bit of the automatically generated identifier). Also some other (otherwise unchosen) bit combinations are reserved for anycast addresses, too.

   Prefix lengths for routing
  </title>
  <para>
   In the early design phase it was planned to use a fully hierarchical routing approach to reduce the size of the routing tables maximally. Reasons for such thoughts were the number of current IPv4 routing entries in core routers (&gt; 104 thousand in May 2001), reducing the need of memory in hardware routers (ASIC driven) to hold the routing table and increase speed (fewer entries hopefully result in faster lookups).
  </para>
  <para>
   Today's view is that routing will be mostly hierarchically designed for networks with only one service provider. With more than one ISP connections, this is not possible, and subject to an issue named multi-homing.
  </para>
   <sect2>
    <title>
    Prefix lengths (also known as &quot;netmasks&quot;)
   </title>
   <para>
    Similar to IPv4, the routable network path for routing to take place. Because standard netmask notation for 128 bits doesn't look nice, designers employed the IPv4 Classless Inter Domain Routing (CIDR, <ulink url="http://rfc.net/rfc1519.html">RFC 1519 / Classless Inter-Domain Routing</ulink>) scheme, which specifies the number of bits of the IP address to be used for routing. It is also called the &quot;slash&quot; notation.

   IPv6-ready kernel
  </title>
  <para>
   Modern Linux distributions already contain IPv6-ready kernels, the IPv6 capability is mostly compiled as module, so it's possible that this module is not loaded on startup.
  </para>

    IPv6-ready network devices
   </title>
   <para>
    Not all existing network devices have already (or ever) the capability to transport IPv6 packets. A current status can be found at <ulink url="http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/status/IPv6+Linux-status-kernel.html#transport">IPv6+Linux-status-kernel.html#transport</ulink>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Major issue is that because of the network layer structure of kernel implementation an IPv6 packet isn't really recognized by it's IP header number (6 instead of 4). It's recognized by the protocol number of the Layer 2 transport protocol. Therefore any transport protocol which doesn't use such protocol number hasn't now the capability to dispatch the IPv6 packet. Attention: the packet is still transported over the link, but on receivers side, the dispatching won't work (you can see this e.g. using tcpdump).

     Error message: &quot;<emphasis>connect: Invalid argument</emphasis>&quot;

    <para>
     Kernel doesn't know, which physical or virtual link you want to use to send such ICMPv6 packets. Therefore it displays this error message.
    </para>
    <para>
     Solution: Specify interface like: &quot;ping6 -I eth0 fe80::2e0:18ff:fe90:9205&quot;, see also <link linkend="program-ping6">program ping6 usage</link>.

    <para>
     This utilities create special ICMPv6 packets and send them out. This is done by using raw sockets in the kernel. But raw sockets can only be used by the &quot;root&quot; user. Therefore normal users get such error message.
    </para>
    <para>
     Solution: If it's really needed that all users should be able to use this utilites, you can add the &quot;suid&quot; bit using &quot;chmod u+s /path/to/program&quot;, see also <link linkend="program-ping6">program ping6 usage</link>. If not all users should be able to, you can change the group of the program to e.g. &quot;wheel&quot;, add this power users to this group and remove the execution bit for other users using &quot;chmod o-rwx /path/to/program&quot;. Or configure &quot;sudo&quot; for fullfilling your security policy.

     Routers on packet forwarding
    </title>
    <para>
     Current mainstream Linux kernel (at least &lt;= 2.4.17) don't support default routes. You can set them up, but the route lookup fails when a packet should be forwarded (normal intention of a router).
    </para>
    <para>
     Therefore at this time &quot;default routing&quot; can be setup using the currently only global address prefix &quot;2000::/3&quot;.
    </para>
    <para>
     The USAGI project already supports this in their extension with a hack.
    </para>
    <para>
     Note: take care about default routing without address filtering on edge routers. Otherwise unwanted multicast or site-local traffic leave the edge.

    A point-to-point tunnel is a dedicated tunnel to an endpoint, which knows about your IPv6 network (for backward routing) and the IPv4 address of your tunnel endpoint and defined in <ulink url="http://rfc.net/rfc2893.html">RFC 2893 / Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers</ulink>.

    6to4-Tunneling
   </title>
   <para>
    6to4 tunneling (<ulink url="http://rfc.net/rfc3056.html">RFC 3056 / Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds</ulink>) uses a simple mechanism to create automatic tunnels. Each node with a global unique IPv4 address is able to be a 6to4 tunnel endpoint (if no IPv4 firewall prohibits traffic). 6to4 tunneling is mostly not a one-to-one tunnel. This case of tunneling can be divided into upstream and downstream tunneling. Also, a special IPv6 address indicates that this node will use 6to4 tunneling for connecting the world-wide IPv6 network

     Upstream tunneling
    </title>
    <para>
     The node has to know to which foreign tunnel endpoint its in IPv4 packed IPv6 packets should be send to. In &quot;early&quot; days of 6to4 tunneling, dedicated upstream accepting routers were defined. See  <ulink url="http://www.kfu.com/~nsayer/6to4/">NSayer's 6to4 information</ulink> for a list of routers.

    <para>
     Nowadays, 6to4 upstream routers can be found auto-magically using the anycast address 192.88.99.1. In the background routing protocols handle this, see <ulink url="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3068.html">RFC 3068 / An Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers</ulink> for details.

  Support for persistent IPv6 configuration in Linux distributions

 <para>
  Some Linux distribution contain already support of a persistent IPv6 configuration using existing or new configuration and script files and some hook in the IPv4 script files.

   Red Hat Linux and &quot;clones&quot;
  </title>
  <para>
   Since starting writing the <ulink url="http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/">IPv6 & Linux - HowTo</ulink> it was my intention to enable a persistent IPv6 configuration which catch most of the wished cases like host-only, router-only, dual-homed-host, router with second stub network, normal tunnels, 6to4 tunnels, and so on. Nowadays there exists a set of configuration and script files which do the job very well (never heard about real problems, but I don't know how many use the set. Because this configuration and scrips files are extended from time to time, they got their own HOWTO page: <ulink url="http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/IPv6-HOWTO/scripts/current/">IPv6-HOWTO/scripts/current</ulink>. Because I began my IPv6 experience using a Red Hat Linux 5.0 clone, my IPv6 development systems are mostly Red Hat Linux based now, it's kind a logic that the scripts are developed for this kind of distribution (so called <emphasis>historic issue</emphasis>). Also it was very easy to extend some configuration files, create new ones and create some simple hook for calling IPv6 setup during IPv4 setup.
  </para>
  <para>
   Fortunately, in Red Hat Linux since 7.1 a snapshot of my IPv6 scripts is included, this was and is still further on assisted by Pekka Savola.
  </para>
  <para>
   Mandrake since version 8.0 also includes an IPv6-enabled initscript package, but a minor bug still prevents usage (&quot;ifconfig&quot; misses &quot;inet6&quot; before &quot;add&quot;).

    Test for IPv6 support
   </title>
   <para>
    You can test, whether your Linux distribution contain support for persistent IPv6 configuration using my set. Following script library should exist:
   </para>
   <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/network-functions-ipv6
]]>   </programlisting>
   <para>
    Auto-magically test:
   </para>
   <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [# test -f /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/network-functions-ipv6 && echo "Main
]]><![ CDATA [¬ IPv6 script libary exists"
]]>   </programlisting>
   <para>
    The version of the library is important if you miss some features. You can get it executing following (or easier look at the top of the file):
   </para>
   <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [# source /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/network-functions-ipv6 &&
]]><![ CDATA [¬ getversion_ipv6_functions 
]]><![ CDATA [20011124
]]>   </programlisting>
   <para>
    In shown example, the used version is 20011124. Check this against latest information on <ulink url="http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/IPv6-HOWTO/scripts/current/">IPv6-HOWTO/scripts/current</ulink> to see what has been changed. There is also a change-log available in the distributed tar-ball.

   Because of the really different configuration and script file structure it is hard (or impossible) to use the set for Red Hat Linux and clones with this distribution.

  Firewalling and security issues
 </title>
 <para>
  IPv6 firewalling is important, especially if using IPv6 on internal networks with global IPv6 addresses. Because unlike at IPv4 networks where in common internal hosts are protected automatically using private IPv4 addresses like <ulink url="http://rfc.net/rfc1918.html">RFC 1918 / Address Allocation for Private Internets</ulink> or <ulink url="http://www.glossary-tech.com/apipa.htm">APIPA / Automatic Private IP Addressing</ulink>, in IPv6 normally global addresses are used and someone with IPv6 connectivity can reach all internal IPv6 enabled nodes.

     Protect against incoming UDP connection requests (ALSO RECOMMENDED!), like mentioned on my firewall information it's possible to control the ports on outgoing UDP/TCP sessions. So if all of your local IPv6 systems are use local ports e.g. from 32768 to 60999 you are able to filter UDP connections also (until connection tracking works) like:
