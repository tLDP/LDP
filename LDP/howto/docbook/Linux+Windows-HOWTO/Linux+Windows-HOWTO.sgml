	Nancy just bought a new computer.  It came preloaded with Windows 98. Nancy wants to run accounting software supported by Windows 98 and mathematical research software. Nancy is an accountant and donates her time as the accountant for the local chapter of a charitable organization.  The charitable organization requires the chapters to use standard software that they have chosen.  This software is only supported on Windows 98, so Nancy must have Windows 98 to donate her accounting services.  Nancy also teaches mathematics and personally pursues research mathematics.  She is not a programmer amd doesn't want to waste unnecessary time doing system administration nor working with inflexible software.  She believes that octave, c++ and the best research software is supported by unix.  As a unix dialect she wants linux.

	Lisa is shopping for a new computer to replace her aging host.  Her computer will be preloaded with RedHat 6.2 linux.  Lisa is a professional programmer, who plans to run a server and firewall on her old computer.  Lisa wants a low maintenance machine that reliability does her bidding.  Occasionally she needs to read and write files for Macintosh and/or Windows users.  She plans to remove Windows 95 from her old computer and run a dedicated server and firewall under linux.  In accordance with her Microsoft End User License Agreement she will transfer Windows 95 to her new computer.  Since she plans to spend most of her time in linux, it isn't worth buying a second Windows license to run Windows on both hosts.

	Oscar is a system administrator for a large corporation that uses Windows NT and Irix workstations.  One of the Windows NT workstations has just crashed and won't boot.  Oscar has to recover critical data from the host which was not backed up.  He needs tools to script searches and filter files.  Oscar wants to use the panolpy of unix commands to low-level examine the hard disk in his search for the lost corporate assets.  Last year Oscar configured a "dual booter" but he no longer remembers the details.

	<title>How to Use This HOWTO</title>
<para>
	 This HOWTO is focused on a general step-by-step procedure.  You should first read which character among the intended audience  that you most nearly match.  Follow along as Tom helps each characters configure their systems.  Before doing more than skimming, you should at least skim the critical concepts.  Some of the words used may be unfamiliar, obsolete, or applied differently, so it is important to understand their usage in this HOWTO.  Please write the maintainer with your experience good or bad.

	Installing linux on Nancy system will involve repartitioning.  Any time you repartition a hard disk you run a significant risk of losing data on the disk.  More precisely repartitioning does not actually cause data loss, but does tend to discover data that was lost piror.

	Tom warned Nancy that she should backup everything before starting.  Familiar with pluming repair, Tom knew that whey you shut off the water for 10min to replace a dripping faucet, you often find that the pipes in the floor were rusted and leaking.  Nancy knew nothiing of plumbing, but she had a good book collection and had moved several times.  She knew that bookshelves often break when you move them.
</para>
<para>
	Since Lisa is buying a new computer, she has nothing yet to backup.  When Oscar asked for the backups of the crashed computer he was met with the usual blank expressions.  His job is essentially ot make a backup of the otherwise lost data.

	This version of this HOWTO does not detail how to backup.  If you wish to see more information on backing up or if you wish to provide information please contact the maintainer.

<para>
	During installation, the size of disks, and other accurate specifications will be necessary.  Entry of slightly wrong values will result in subtle problems that may not show up immediately but will often be chronic, frustratingly difficult to diagnose, and maybe impossible to fix.

<para>
	Windows and your linux distribution may not support the same hardware.  You should see the Hardware Compatibility HOWTO for a list of what is known to be compatible or incompatible.
</para>
<para>
	In general Windows is the more restrictive with exception of WinModems/WinPrinters/....  Any hardware supported by Windows will usually be supported by linux, though not necessarily included in your distribution.  Much hardware, especially the old and the cutting edge, may be supported by linux but not by Windows.  If not included in your distribution, you can usually download linux drivers and or modules from the Internet.
</para>
<para>
	Winmodems, Winprinters, Winscanners, etc. are not supportable under linux.  These devices are actually firmware that depend on proprietary Windows software.  In the United States it is illegal to sell a linux distribution that supports these devices.

	Tom knows that one of the least expensive means to support reliability in any complex system (computer, airplane, car, etc.) is by keeping accurate maintenance records.  Many (if not most) of the compatiblity problems reported by Tom's students would be prevented if accurate records were kept and consulted.

<sect3 id="compact">
	<title>Compact</title>

<para>
	Most new computers preloaded with Windows are delivered with a single FAT32 partition that occupies the entire disk.  Before loading a second operating system on a shared disk, it must be split into at least two partitions, since Windows and some linux distributions will not tolerate another operating system on the same partition.
</para>
<para>
<inlinemediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="Tom.gif">
</imageobject>
</inlinemediaobject>
	Software is normally stored distributed across the disk partition.  Before splitting a partition, all the data must be moved to the start of the partition, so that when the partition is split, the old software and data won't be lost.   Tom warns Lisa, Nancy, and especially Oscar that compacting is not reversible.  If the partition is error-free, no active files will be lost, but disconnected (deleted) files may be lost.  If the partition has errors, tools exist that can often (but not always) recover disconnected files before compaction.  After compacting , the disconnected files are probably unrecoverable.
</para>
<para>
	The fips included in tomsrtbt-1.6.335 is 0.9e and Tom has used it directly with Windows 95.  Windows98 requires fips-2.0 or later which (at press time) was not included in the archived tomsrtbt distributions.

Nancy's new machine was delivered preloaded with Windows 98 on a single partition occupying the entire disk.  The installation was already compact, but Nancy used scandisk and defrag anyway just to be safe.   When splitting the partition with fips, it warns that the physical partition length does not equal the logical partitin length.  Tom explains that this is expected since her disk has more than 1024 cylinders.  Tom suggests that Nancy record the current partition info in case it is needed to recover from a disaster.  Following Tom's suggestion, Nancy reduces the first partition to approximately 30% of the total disk size.

	The Windows bootable partition must be one of the filesystems supported by Windows.  Likewise the linux bootable partition must be one of the filesystems supported by linux.  The swap partition must have a filesystem supported by the operating system that will use it.  The last partition will be used for data, and can have any filesystm.

	Nancy is unfamiliar with open source and the Internet, so Tom lends her one of his diagnostic disks with tomsrtbt..
</para>
<para>
	tomsrtbt is a small distribution of linux on a single floppy disk that loads into RAM.  Since it does not occupy nor run on the hard disk it is superb for situations where the hard disk will be modified (e.g. repartitioning).

	<title>Initial Program Load</title>

<para>
	Now is when the operating system(s) becomes a part ot the computer.  All prior steps laid the foundation.  This is the first time when the detail and accuracy of the catalog will be especially useful.  Follow the installation instructions provided with your distribution.   This HOWTO does not detail how to load the distribution because the distribution instructions will provide the best instructions.

	Though linux is available at no cost, Tom recommends purchasing a distribution with hardcopy instructions and support tools..  The price of a good distribution is well worth it.  In Tom's opinion, asking friends is the best way to choose a linux distribution.  A distribution that satisfies your friends with similar interests will probably satisfy you.
</para>
<para>
	Tom knows that Nancy got a newly released graphics card with which he has no experience.  He warns Nancy that the X configuration may not work.  When she calls him, he uses the expert options of yast which tell him that though her card is not listed by manufacturer and model it used the mach64 X server.  Now familiar with yast, Nancy installs the mach64 x server and removes the svga X server.  Tom stays to talk Nancy through X installation.  Nancy's monitor is not named in the configuration list, but with the model known from the catalog, a quick visit to the manufacturer's website provides the scan rate limits.
</para>
<para>
	Tom knows that the configurability of linux frightens many new users and so he has often recommended RedHat to first-time users because of its commercial technical support and default configuration settings.  He lets Nancy know that though she should try to consider each question before answering, she need fear a mistake because she can reverse almost any configuration decision later.   Most packages managment tools offer to load and save configurations files (e.g. /etc/linuxrc).

To save space, the New York host may delete mail that could not be sent in a reasonable time of 30min.  If the Berlin mail was unclear that it was sent at 1300 Berlin time, or if the New York host is unwilling to do the conversion, the email may be lost as undliverable after 1 hour (1300 - 1200).</para>

	Nancy is unfamiliar with keeping a log, so Tom prepared it for her as he unboxed and assembled her new computer.   tom also knows that it is far easier to remove the computer case once and record all the model numbers, chipsets, and model types than it is to later open the case to get a single model number or to guess the information that will be later needed.  During the computer service life, only 10% of the numbers collected will ever be used, but there is no easy way to predict which 10%.

	The following is an extract from Nancy's log.  Identidation numbers have been changed and some irrelevant data has been removed.  Most of the data came from the invoice that accomapanied the computer and the specifications [Start\Run...\] Open: c:\DELL\DOCS\EDOCS.EXE [OK] that were provided on the computer.

	<title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>

<qandaset>
	<qandaentry>
		<question id="faq-fips">
			<para>After running fips, why does Windows report that I still have only one partition?</para>
		</question>
		<answer>
			<para>Windows 98 does not recognize the effect of fips-0.9e.  fips-2.0 has successfully been used to split a Windows98 partition.  According to an unreliable source, Windows 98 reads partition data from the first 512 bytes of the partition itself and considers this more reliable data than the partition table.</para>
		</answer>
	</qandaentry>
	<qandaentry>
		<question id="faq-tool">
			<para>Why does my tool report an error that physical length does not match the logical length of the partition?</para>
		</question>
		<answer>
			<para>This means that the partition table is inconsistent, and may be inaccurate.  Modifying a disk with an inaccurate partition table usually requires an expert to reduce the almost certain chance of data loss.</para>
			<para>The severity of this message is dependent on the size of the disk.  Due to historical limitations, most (but not all) computer BIOSs only support disks with less than 1024 cylinders.  Booting the operating system depends on the bios, therefore (on such systems), the entire operating system must fit within this 1024 cylinders..  For the same historical reasons, the partition table format only supports reporting disk sizes of 1024 or less cylinders.  Many disks today have more than 1024 physical cylinders but by convention the partition table records exactly 1024 cylinders.  The operating system still needs to know where the actual partitions begin an end beyond the first 1024 cylinders and this is recorded in the partition table.</para>
			<para>A large disk with more than 1024 cylinders will have a logical size (sum of partition sizes) that exceeds 1024 and matches the actual size, though the partition table reports a physical size of exactly 1024 cylinders.  In the case of a large disk, this message is essentially useless.</para>

		<question id="faq-distrobution">
			<para>How do I know what version of linux distribution I have?</para>
		</question>
		<answer>
			<para>The question may have no meaningful answer.  Since unix dialects (e.g. linux) use many interchangeable parts, it makes little difference to this HOWTO what distribution you have.  The applications loaded on most linux hosts varies with time and the tastes of the owner, so that they seldom match any distribution for more than a very brief period.</para>
			<para>Most distributions are loosely classed by the package manager that they use.</para>

					<para>rpm - RedHat</para>

	<qandaentry>
		<question id="faq-mistake">
			<para>If I make a mistake can I start over?</para>
		</question>
		<answer>
			<para>In general, no.  For this reason, meticuluous care is required, especially at certain stages.  Some of the operations are idempotent. An idempotent operation is one which either fails and has no effect, or succeeds and has no effect after its first success.  Some of the operations are reversible.  A reversible operation has an inverse operation so that you can return things to what they were and start over.</para>
			<para>Formatting is especially dangerous because it is neither idempotent nor reversible.  If formatting succeeds, the original data is lost.  If formatting fails, the original data is probably lost (since indices are usually destroyed early).</para>

		<question id="faq-partition">
			<para>How large should my swap partition be?</para>
		</question>
		<answer>
			<para>Swap partition size (or even its existence) is a hotly debated issue beyond the scope of this HOWTO.  Many books on performanc tuning provide guidelines on swap partition size and how to recognize a need to expand or shrink it.  At press time, the author recommends 64M as a safe size.</para>
		</answer>
	</qandaentry>
	<qandaentry>
		<question id="faq-package">
			<para>Should I add package xxx?</para>
		</question>
		<answer>
			<para>A reader of this HOWTO presumably wants to benefit from the strengths of both Windows and linux, and suffer the shortcomings of neither.</para>
			<para>Most linux distributions allow you to cleanly remove any package.  unix dialects support permissions so that each package gets a well defined share of the computer and this share can be identified and taken back in its entirety.  unix dialects support symbolic links so that the package can appear to be in a convenient place without actually occupying space from the convenient place.  The distributions that do not support easy removal are usually tiny specialized distributions like tomsrtbt.  The risk that an unwanted  package will plague your linux indefinitely is small since you can remove it at any time.</para>
			<para>Most Windows packages can never be uninstalled cleanly under Windows, as they usually leave dll updates and registry entries.  It is therefore important to add packages only when you are sure that you need them, since your only way of removing them may be to reinstall Windows and every package that you want.</para>
			<para>Sharing a machine between Windows and linux, means that linux can aid clean removal of packages from Windows.  Since it only identifies but does not predict, linux cannot insure clean removal.  Since linux find resolves to the second rather than Windows find to the day, it can much more accurately identify what was changed.</para>

				<para>A disk is a physical storage medium.  A disk must be formatted before data on the disk is accessible.  A municipal library building is a good model of a disk.  The building itslf has a fixed volume and can therefore hold a fixed number of books.  The largest number of books can be stored by simply dumping them inside the building, but the result would simply be a big trash pile and the books would not be available for use.  In order to use the books, they are placed on bookshelves so they can be accessed.  Placing the equivalent of bookshelves on the disk is called formatting</para>

			<para>Each bootable partition has firmware that runs in the bios.  This firmware historically occupies the 446 bytes before the partition table.  A simple master boot record simply copies the operating system from the media into memory and turns computer control over to the operating system.</para>
			<para>At power up, cold boot, or warm boot, the bios searches the computer storage media until it finds a master boot record which it then executes it.  The search locations and order differ between different bioses.  Often the search order is configuratble with firmware encoded in the computer hardware with the bios. The most common search order is floppy, cdrom, network, usb disk, scsi disk, ide disk.</para>

			<para>An operating system is firmware that supports effective computter use.  As an allocator, the operating system verifies that only one process at a time controls the cpu , disk, write access to a file, and other unshareable resources.  As a toolkit, the operating system provides a set of software pieces for common functions (e.g. reading from a file, writing to the screen).  As a virtual machine, the operating system makes the physical computer behave like another well-specified computer, so that software can be written once for the well-specified computer and then run on many physical computers with compatible operating systems.  As an allocator, the operating system is like the staff that schedules the use of meeting rooms in the library.  As a toolkit, the operating system is like the library staff that reshelves books or the library copier.  As a virtual machine, the operating system is like one of the many libraries that endeaver to look like the U.S. Library of Congress with vertical bookshelves, a circular reference desk, and a lobby area with indices.  A patron entering any such library finds the layout familiar, and one patron can give usable directions to a patron of a different library.</para>

			<para>A disk is a physical portion of a disk.  A filesystem is a map between addresses and files accessed on the disk.  Most libraries are divided into floors or sections, such as Adult Fiction, Reference, and Juvenile Non-Fiction.  Each section usually has its own card catalog and often different sections use different schemes.  Adult Fiction is usually indexed by Author Name.  Reference is usually indexed by Subject.  There are even competing indexing schemes for the same section such as Dewey Decimal or Library of Congress.</para>

			<glossdef>
				<para>Winmodems are a class of devices including winprinters, winscanners.  Winmodems are a subset of the class of devices that achieve low-cost by replacing hardware in their convential equivalents with firmware run by the host.  The drawback of these devices is that their dependence on the host usually slows or prohibits other operations simultaneously on the host.</para>
				<para>By analogy low-cost headlights for an automobile might consist of a flashlight atop a battery tray that sits in the front passenger seat.  To use the headlights, you must start the car, remove the battery from the car, and install the car battery in the flashlight tray.  The headlight cost is reduced by the cost of the solenoid, dashboard switch,  wiring, and fuses.  If you use the headlights, the limitations mean that you can't carry a front passenger, you can't restart the car, you can't use the car radio, and the fuel guage reads empty.</para>
				<para>Winmodems are distinct from the slightly larger class of these low-cost devices by the fact that they use proprietary firmware included in the Windows operating system.  In the United States, it is illegal to sell firmware to use this proprietary firmware without Microsoft consent.  At press time, the price of Microsoft consent is only slightly less than the cost of a convential device.</para>
