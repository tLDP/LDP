Always use pure vanilla kernel-sources from e.g. www.kernel.org to compile 
an openMosix kernel!
Be sure to use the right openMosix version dependend on the 
kernel-version. 
Do not use the kernel that comes whith any linux-distribution; it won't 
work.
</PARA><PARA>
Download the actual version of openMosix and untar it in your 
kernel-source directory 
(e.g. /usr/src/linux-2.4.16). If your kernel-source directory is other 
than 
"/usr/src/linux-[version_number]" at least the creation of a symbolic link 
to 
"/usr/src/linux-[version_number]" is required.
Now apply the patch using the patch utility:
<PROGRAMLISTING>
patch -Np1 < openMosix1.5.2moshe
</PROGRAMLISTING>

This command displays now a list of patched files from the kernel-sources.
Enable the openMosix-options in the kernel-configuration e.g.
<PROGRAMLISTING>
...
CONFIG_MOSIX=y
# CONFIG_MOSIX_TOPOLOGY is not set
CONFIG_MOSIX_UDB=y
# CONFIG_MOSIX_DEBUG is not set
# CONFIG_MOSIX_CHEAT_MIGSELF is not set
CONFIG_MOSIX_WEEEEEEEEE=y
CONFIG_MOSIX_DIAG=y
CONFIG_MOSIX_SECUREPORTS=y
CONFIG_MOSIX_DISCLOSURE=3
CONFIG_QKERNEL_EXT=y
CONFIG_MOSIX_DFSA=y
CONFIG_MOSIX_FS=y
CONFIG_MOSIX_PIPE_EXCEPTIONS=y
CONFIG_QOS_JID=y
...
</PROGRAMLISTING>

and compile it with:

<PROGRAMLISTING>
make dep bzImage modules modules_install
</PROGRAMLISTING>

After compilation install the new kernel with the openMosix options within 
you boot-loader e.g.
insert an entry for the new kernel in /etc/lilo.conf and run lilo after 
that.

<PARA>


Syntax of the /etc/hpc.map file

Before starting openMosix there has to be a /etc/hpc.map configuration 
file (on each node) 
which must be equal on each node. The hpc.map contains three space 
seperated fields:
<PROGRAMLISTING>
openMosix-Node_ID               IP-Adress(or hostname)          Range-size
</PROGRAMLISTING>

An example hpc.map could look like this:
<PROGRAMLISTING>
1       node1   1
2       node2   1
3       node3   1
4       node4   1
</PROGRAMLISTING>

or

<PROGRAMLISTING>
1       192.168.1.1     1
2       192.168.1.2     1
3       192.168.1.3     1
4       192.168.1.4     1
</PROGRAMLISTING>

or with the help of the range-size these both exampels are equal with:

<PROGRAMLISTING>
1       192.168.1.1     4
</PROGRAMLISTING>

openMosix "counts-up" the last byte of the ip-adress of the node according 
to its openMosix-ID.
(if you use a range-size greater than 1 you have to use ip-adresses 
instead of hostnames)
</PARA><PARA>
If a node has more than one network-interfaces it can be configured with 
the ALIAS option in the 
range-size field (which is equal to set the range-size to 0) e.g.

<PROGRAMLISTING>
1       192.168.1.1     1
2       192.168.1.2     1
3       192.168.1.3     1
4       192.168.1.4     1
4       192.168.10.10   ALIAS
</PROGRAMLISTING>
Here the node with the openMosix-ID 4 has two network-interfaces 
(192.168.1.4 + 192.168.10.10) which
are both visible to openMosix.
</PARA><PARA>

Always be sure to run the same openMosix version AND configuration on each 
of your Cluster nodes!
</PARA><PARA>

Start openMosix with the "setpe" utility on each node :

setpe -w -f /etc/hpc.map

Execute this command (which will be described later on in this howto) on 
every node in your openMosix
cluster. Installation finished now, the cluster is up and running :)

<PARA>



At first the CONFIG_MOSIX_FS option in the kernel configuration has to be 
enabled. If the current kernel
 was compiled without this option recompilation with this option enabled 
is required. Also the UIDs and
GUIDs in the cluster must be equivalent.
The CONFIG_MOSIX_DFSA option in the kernel is optional but of course 
required if DFSA should be used.
To mount MFS on the cluster there has to be an additional fstab-entry on 
each nodes /etc/fstab.
</PARA><PARA>
for DFSA enabled:
<PROGRAMLISTING>
mfs_mnt         /mfs            mfs     dfsa=1          0 0
</PROGRAMLISTING>

for DFSA disabled:
<PROGRAMLISTING>
mfs_mnt          /mfs           mfs     dfsa=0          0 0
</PROGRAMLISTING>

the syntax of this fstab-entry is:
<PROGRAMLISTING>
[device_name]           [mount_point]   mfs     defaults        0 0
</PROGRAMLISTING>

After mounting the /mfs mount-point on each node, each nodes filesystem is 
accessable through the 
/mfs/[openMosix_ID]/ directories. 
</PARA><PARA>

With the help of some symbolic links all cluster-nodes can access the same 
data e.g. /work on node1
<PROGRAMLISTING>
on node2 :      ln -s /mfs/1/work /work
on node3 :      ln -s /mfs/1/work /work
on node3 :      ln -s /mfs/1/work /work
...

The following is based on using SuSE 7.1 (German Version), Linux
  Kernel 2.2.19, and Mosix 0.98.0. 

</PARA><PARA>  

  The Linux Kernel 2.2.18 sources are part of the SuSE distribution. Do
  not use the default SuSE 2.2.18 kernel, as it is heavily patched with
  SuSE stuff. Get the patch for 2.2.19 from your favorite mirror such as
  . If there are further patches for the 2.2.* kernel
  RROR URL HERE by the time you read this text, get those, too. 

</PARA><PARA>

  If one of your machines is a laptop with a network connection via
  pcmcia, you will need the pcmcia sources, too. They are included in
  the SuSE distribution as MISSING: RPM HERE.

</PARA><PARA>

  Mosix 0.98.0 for the 2.2.19 kernel can be found on
  http://www.mosix.org as MOSIX-0.98.0.tar.gz . While you are there, you
  might want to get some of the contributed software like qps or mtop.
  Again, if there is a version more current than 0.98.0 by the time you
  read this, get it instead.

</PARA><PARA>

  SuSE 7.1 ships with a Mosix-package as a rpm MISSING: RPM HERE
  Ignore this package. It is based on Kernel 2.2.18 and seems to have
  been modified by SuSE (see /usr/share/doc/packages/mosix/README.SUSE).
  You are better off installing the Mosix sources and installing from
  scratch.

</PARA>
</SECT2>

<SECT2><TITLE>Installation</TITLE>
<PARA> 

We're assuming your hardware and basic Linux system are all set up
correctly and that you can at least telnet (or ssh) between the different
machines. The procedure is described for one machine.  Log in as root.
Install the sources for the 2.2.18 Kernel in /usr/src. SuSE will place them
there automatically as /usr/src/linux-2.2.18 if you install the RPM RPM
NAME. Rename the directory to /usr/src/linux-2.2.19. Remove the existing
link /usr/src/linux and create a new one to this directory with

 
<PROGRAMLISTING>
        ln -s /usr/src/linux-2.2.19 linux
</PROGRAMLISTING>
     
(assuming you are in /usr/src).  Patch the kernel to 2.2.19 (or whatever
the current version is). If you do not know to do this, check the Linux
Kernel HOWTO.  Make a directory /usr/src/linux-2.2.19-mosix and copy the
contents of the vanilla kernel /usr/src/linux-2.2.19 there with the command
 
<PROGRAMLISTING>
        cp -rp linux-2.2.19/* linux-2.2.19-mosix/ 
</PROGRAMLISTING>
 
     
     
This gives you a clean backup kernel to fall back on if something goes
wrong. Remove the /usr/src/linux link (again). Create a link /usr/src/linux
to /usr/src/linux-2.2.19-mosix with

 
<PROGRAMLISTING>
        ln -s /usr/src/linux-2.2.19-mosix linux
</PROGRAMLISTING>

to make life easier.  Change to /tmp, copy the Mosix sources there and
unpack them with the command

 
<PROGRAMLISTING>
        tar xfz MOSIX-0.98.0.tar.gz
</PROGRAMLISTING>
 
Do not unpack the resulting tar archives such as /tmp/user.tar that appear.

<SECT1><TITLE>Debian and Mosix</TITLE>
<PARA>
Installing mosix on a Debian based machine can be done as described below 

First step is downloading the packages from the net.  Since we are using a
debian setup we needed


<PROGRAMLISTING>
http://packages.debian.org/unstable/net/mosix.html
http://packages.debian.org/unstable/net/kernel-patch-mosix.html
http://packages.debian.org/unstable/net/mps.html
</PROGRAMLISTING>

You can also apt-get install them ;)

Next part is making the kernel mosix capable.

Copy the patch.$kernel version in to your /usr/src/linux-$version
directory run


<PROGRAMLISTING>
patch -p0 < patches.2.4.10
</PROGRAMLISTING>

Check your kernel config and run

<PROGRAMLISTING>
make dep ; make clean ; make bzImage ; make modules ; make modules_install
</PROGRAMLISTING>

You now wil need to edit your /etc/mosix/mosix.map
This file has a bit a strange layout.
We have 2 machines 192.168.10.65 and 192.168.10.94

This gives us a mosix.map that looks like
<PROGRAMLISTING>
1 192.168.10.65 1
2 192.168.10.94 1
</PROGRAMLISTING>


After rebooting with this kernel (lilo etc you know the drill),
you then should have a cluster of mosix machines that talk to eachoter and
that do migration of processes.


You can test that by running the following small script  ..
<PROGRAMLISTING>
awk 'BEGIN {for(i=0;i<10000;i++)for(j=0;j<10000;j++);}'
</PROGRAMLISTING>
a couple of times, and monitor it`s behaviour with mon
where you will see that it spreads the load between 2 different nodes.

If you have enabled Process-arrival messages in your kernel you will
notice that each time a remote (guest) process arrives on your node a
Weeeeeee will be printed and each time a local proces returns you will see
a Woooooo on your console.  So basically If you don`t see any of those
messages during the running of a program and if you have this option
enabled in your kernel you might conclude that no processes migrate.



We also setup Mosixview (0.8) on the debian machine
<PROGRAMLISTING>
apt-get install mosixview
</PROGRAMLISTING>

In order to be able to actually use Mosixview you will need to run it from
a user who can log in to the different nodes as root.   We suggest you set
this up using ssh.  Please note that there is a difference between the ssh
and ssh2 implemtations .. if you have a identity.pub ssh wil check  
authorized_keys, if you have id_rsa.pub you will need authorized_keys2 !!


Mosixview gives you a nice interface that shows the load of different
machines and gives you the possibility to migrate processes manually.

A detailed  discussion of Mosixview can be found elsewhere in this 
document.
