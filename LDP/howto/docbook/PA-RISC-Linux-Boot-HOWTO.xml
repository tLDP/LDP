      <para>This document outlines the procedures to get the &PA;/Linux 
kernel to boot on your &PA; system. It also explains the usage of &PO;, 
the kernel loader for &PL;. You will find much information on how to 
compile a kernel from the source available at 
<ulink url="http://cvs.parisc-linux.org/">http://cvs.parisc-linux.org/</ulink>.
 Please note that this HOWTO version is newer than Deb Richardson's and 
includes more accurate information because of the progress of the port. 
Nevertheless, we must say that this document keeps some parts from Deb's 
original one and reveals some of her hidden work.</para>
      <para>If you are looking for some information related to HP 
hardware but not directly to &PA;, please read

      <title>Overview</title>
      <para>You just received this HP box you bought online or maybe you 
got it from your company surplus. Anyway, here comes the question of the 
operating system you are going to use. The &PL; project consists in porting 
Linux to the &PA; architecture. Take a look at this Howto and you will 
see that Linux could be the answer to this question. Anyway, we hope so.</para>
      <para>In addition to port Linux, the development team is working 
on porting the &D; project to &PA;. In fact, around 95&nbsp;% 
of packages are ported and up-to-date in the repository. The port can be 
consider as useful now. In &D;3.0r0 called <emphasis>woody</emphasis>, 
the flavour &quot;hppa&quot; has been released for the first time. Some &D; 
developers non involved in the port but yet curious reported that the 
port was one of the easiest to install since you feel like installing an 
i386 version.</para>
      <para>For more information about the &PA;/Linux porting project, 
please see <ulink url="http://www.parisc-linux.org/">http://www.parisc-linux.org/</ulink>, 
or a mirror like <ulink url="http://www.fr.parisc-linux.org/">http://www.fr.parisc-linux.org/</ulink>. 
This site deals with kernel development and improvement. For userspace 
troubles, please refer to 
<ulink url="http://www.debian.org/ports/hppa/">hppa &D;'s port pages</ulink>.</para>
      <para>In a few words, this HOWTO is aimed to anyone looking for some 
help and information about using Linux on a HP system based on &PA; 
architecture. No special knowledge is necessary but bases about 
how &D; packages work can be helpful.</para>
      <para>If you care about just installing and you do not ask yourself 
about the way it works, the best advice is to try a &D; release including
the &PA; port. The <emphasis>Woody</emphasis> version is now 
<ulink url="ftp://ftp.de.debian.org/debian-cd/3.0_r0/hppa/">available</ulink> 
for hppa architecture. If you experience any trouble, try the development 
<xref linkend="glossnetinst"/> ISO images from the 
<ulink url="http://pateam.esiee.fr/download.html">The &PL; 
ESIEE Team</ulink>.</para>
      <para>After listing the supported hardware, this HOWTO explains 
some commands of the basic console available at boot time. Then, the 
features of the &PL; kernel loader introduce another chapter showing 
many ways to get your system up and running. At the end, the text goes 
deep in the kernel compilation and configuration.</para>

    <title>Supported Hardware</title>
    <para>With the release of the 0.9.3 version of &PL;, 
a major improvement was 
made in term of quantity and quality of hardware support.
Since 0.9.3 released, the kernel has been greatly improved, so that much 
unsupported hardware by the time 0.9.3 went out is now handled.
That's why even if your model is not listed here, you might give it a try 
and report your result to the mailing list&nbsp;:
<email>parisc-linux@lists.parisc-linux.org</email>.
The following &PA; machines can be booted <emphasis>almost</emphasis> like 
any other box of a different architecture.
We must add that this list can change at any time.
The best way to get an up to date version is to look at
<ulink url="http://pateam.esiee.fr/list.html">http://pateam.esiee.fr/list.html</ulink>.
There you will know if your hardware is supported and up to what level. For 
example, if you can run &PL; using the <emphasis>serial console</emphasis> 
or the graphic card.</para>

    <title>Preparing to boot</title>
    <para>Like any other system, machines based on &PA; processors have to 
go through several steps in order to have &PL; up and running. The next 
section introduces you to the early boot management of your &PA; computer. 
To be a bit less awkward, we might from time to time call it a 
<emphasis>'PA'</emphasis> box. This chapter will give you some 
key concepts like &BA;.</para>
    <sect1 id="bootadmin">
      <title>&BA;</title>
      <para>First of all, you must learn what is and how to use &BA; on your 
&PA; box, before thinking about doing any hacking on it.</para>
      <para>&BA; is a <emphasis>firmware</emphasis> application,
used to manage a &PA; machine at an early boot stage,
<emphasis>i.e.</emphasis> when the box has not yet started its 
<emphasis>Operating System</emphasis>. You will see through this 
HOWTO that there are many references to it, therefore it's worth 
saying that minimalistic &BA; skills are mandatory&nbsp;!</para>
      <sect2 id="enterbootadmin">
        <title>Entering the &BA; interface</title>

<programlisting>
Searching for Potential Boot Devices.
To terminate search, press and hold the ESCAPE key.
</programlisting>
When this message appears, press and hold the <keycap>Esc</keycap> key
until an option menu appears. This can take a while, be patient.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>By default, you should enter the &BA; console.
Though on some 715s and 725s, an option menu looking like this may appear&nbsp;:
<programlisting>
b)    Boot from specified device
s)    Search for bootable devices
a)    Enter Boot Administration mode
x)    Exit and continue boot sequence
?)    Help

Select from menu: 
</programlisting>
Select '<computeroutput>a)  Enter Boot Administration mode</computeroutput>'.
This will bring up a '<computeroutput>BOOT_ADMIN&gt;</computeroutput>' 
prompt.</para>

        </orderedlist>
        <para>Once you have the

        <title>&BA; commands</title>
        <para>&BA; is an early boot subsystem where you can 
execute some precise commands. You should find here everything 
you need to know about them.</para>
        <para>All HP-PA systems have &BA;.
The display can be different but the idea remains the same.
That's why the following list is not complete but consistent enough.
Another important thing is that for each command, you have a shorter way 
to invoke it. You can see the shortcut shown as uppercase letters in 
the command name. Full names will be used in these sections.</para>

current alternative boot path. <command>path pri fwscsi.6.0</command> will 
setup the primary boot path as the device attached to Fast and Wide SCSI

the bootable paths. In several firmware versions, it links them 
to a shortcut (like <computeroutput>P0</computeroutput>. It can even search 
the lan, if the box is able to boot it). You can restrain the search

In order to boot your &PA; system with the &PL; kernel,
you must first set up a <emphasis>console</emphasis> on it.
A <emphasis>console</emphasis> is basically the device where the kernel 
(and the firmware) will display its output, and where your can send your 
input to control the system at an early boot stage. You can use 
either <emphasis>graphic console</emphasis>, which requires to 
have a monitor and a keyboard attached to the system,
or <emphasis>serial console</emphasis>, which allows serial 
communication between the system and another Linux machine,
or any VT system. You should know that the consoles for the firmware 
and for the kernel can be different. For example, you can have to 
interact with the &BA; mode with a monitor and once &PL; is up, 
you have ttys running on serial ports only.
</para>
      <note>
        <para>
Workstations usually boot in graphic mode, whereas servers 
boot in serial mode. Some boxes will also automatically switch 
to serial if no keyboard is connected, or if you hold down 
<literal>TOC</literal> switch while powering the system on.
</para>
      </note>
      <para>
If you don't know what is the actual console of your box, it's quite 
simple&nbsp;: this is where it will send its first output when switched 
on (serial line or monitor output, if any).

      <sect2 id="graphicsconsole">
        <title>Using <emphasis>graphic console</emphasis></title>
        <para>
To use the <emphasis>graphic console</emphasis>, you must first ensure that 
the Linux kernel supports your system's graphic card.
There are two ways to deal with the graphic console.
If you think about bug-reporting any trouble, you must know how to 
differenciate both. First, the <emphasis>STI</emphasis> console is 
the classical video text console, like <emphasis>VGA</emphasis> on a 
common PC for example. This name is due to the fact that each &PA; 
box features the <emphasis>Standard Text Interface</emphasis> which 
defines some standardized ways to access the video memory. 
The other graphic console is the well known 
<emphasis>framebuffer</emphasis> console (which on 
HP-PA uses STI in a special manner, hence the name 
<emphasis>stifb</emphasis>). In this case, when booting, 
you will see a characteristic little penguin appearing on 
the top-left corner. This is the easiest way to differenciate 
the two graphic modes.
</para>
        <para>
Obviously, if you can use <emphasis>graphic console</emphasis>, it 
is the easiest way to proceed. Nevertheless, you must be sure 
that your hardware is supported.

The <emphasis>serial console</emphasis> is a good way to get all 
console messages handy, including the &BA; ones.
It is very useful for bug reports, as its output can be easily dumped.
Moreover, most of the servers can only be managed with serial console.
Anyway, the only cases where you will HAVE TO use serial console is 
either if you don't have a monitor for your &PA; machine, or if your 
machine doesn't support graphics. It is also possible that 
the kernel can NOT handle some specific graphic hardware 
present in your model.

It is the opposite operation compared to the previous one.
By checking your console path, you should see
'<computeroutput>Console path    = rs232_a.9600.8.none</computeroutput>'.

work properly, try to press the <keycap>Tab</keycap> key
(on the keyboard attached to the box of course)
at the beginning of the boot sequence to change the resolution of the display.
By pressing this key, the monitor resolution cycles from one to another.
Perhaps you will need to do this operation several times.
This is also true when you change your monitor.

      <para> 
&PO; is a set of two programs, a boot loader,
which is loaded by the &PA; <emphasis>firmware</emphasis> in memory 
and then executed, and a boot media management tool, which 
prepares and updates bootable media such as hard disk drives.
The &PO; boot loader executable is stored in a file called 
<filename>iplboot</filename>. '<literal>IPL</literal>' is HP 
jargon for <emphasis>Initial Program Loader</emphasis>. 
The boot media management tool is called &PO;, which 
stands for &PL; LOader, just as on x86 the boot media 
management tool is called <application>LILO</application>,
though it's worth mentionning that &PO; doesn't usually need to be called
every time you build and install a new kernel, as 
<application>LILO</application> does. &PO; is strongly related to &PL; 
development. Thus, several versions has been released. The last changes 
are explained by the author of &PO;, <emphasis>Paul Bame</emphasis>, in this

This is what the <emphasis>boot loader</emphasis> part of &PO; does 
(see <xref linkend="paloearlyboot"/>).
Once it has been called by the <emphasis>firmware</emphasis>, 
it will load the Linux Kernel in memory,
passing to it the given arguments,
and tell the processor to branch to its entry point.
This will begin the execution of the kernel on the &PA; computer.

of the disk if your '/' is bigger than that, because if ever your vmlinux goes above the first 2GB of the disk
(like when filling up '/' with data), the box won't boot anymore.

Now let's deal with &PO; configuration.
Here are the various parameters you can change&nbsp;:
</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><parameter>recoverykernel</parameter> is the 
path to the kernel that you want to boot within a failsafe session, 
it will be stored in the '<literal>f0</literal>' partition.
</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><parameter>bootloader</parameter> is the path 
to the <filename>iplboot</filename> boot loader utility which is 
created by &PO; when you issue a <command>make iplboot</command>.
</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><parameter>init-partitioned</parameter> is used 
to indicate the pre-partionned device where palo will write its 
boot parameters. The effect is immediate. It means that &PO; is 
going to write on the first octets of the first partition of this 
device, which partition-type must be '<literal>f0</literal>', as shown above.
</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><parameter>commandline</parameter>&nbsp;:
the first digit is the number of your ext2 partition where the 
kernel file is located, as reported by <command>fdisk</command>. 
Logically, the next string is the absolute path to the kernel. 
The following space separated parameters will be passed to the 
kernel as its arguments. <emphasis>e.g.</emphasis>&nbsp;: 
<literal>HOME=</literal> and <literal>TERM=</literal> are 
environmental parameters passed to <command>init</command> 
when booting. They are not compulsory but they can be useful. 
<literal>root=</literal> tells the kernel which partition it 
must mount as the root file system while booting. It can be 
tricky when you have more than one disk.
</para>
            <para>
You can also add <literal>console=</literal>,
to force the designation of the output console.
You should remind that <literal>console=ttyS0</literal> is for 
a serial console and <literal>console=tty0</literal> is for a 
STI-console. Recently, support for the <literal>PDC</literal> 
console (if enabled in the kernel, see <xref linkend="PDC"/>) 
has been added, using <literal>console=ttyB0</literal>. Indeed, 
the latest versions of &PO; autodetect the right console path 
(except for <literal>PDC</literal>), and can figure out whether 
a 32bit or 64bit kernel should be used. If not, please mail 
to the mailing list.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
In fact, this third usage of &PO; is the most common but the default 
<filename>/etc/palo.conf</filename> makes it easy to configure.
Just choose your root partition. It should the partition containing your root 
directory. According our <command>fdisk</command> example, we want 
<filename class="devicefile">/dev/sda3</filename>. Thus, the configuration
file should look like that&nbsp;:
        <programlisting>
# The following arguments are set up for booting from /dev/sda3, specifically
# mounting partition 3 as root, and using /boot/vmlinux as both the
# recovery kernel, and the default dynamically-booted kernel.
--recoverykernel=/boot/vmlinux
--bootloader=/boot/iplboot
--init-partitioned=/dev/sda
--commandline=3/boot/vmlinux HOME=/ TERM=linux root=/dev/sda3

        <para>
You have setup everything, rebooted your box, and suddendly you 
want to change something to the kernel boot arguments,
or even boot another kernel. Damn it&nbsp;! How could you, 
now that the box is booting&nbsp;? Well, stay calm and relax, 
we have the solution&nbsp;!
</para>
        <para>
First, you must learn how to interact with &PO; during the startup sequence.
You have to enter &BA;, as explained in <xref linkend="enterbootadmin"/>.
For some old models (up to 712 or so), you must add the 
<parameter>ipl</parameter> (or <parameter>isl</parameter>) string to 
your boot command in the &BA; console&nbsp;:
<programlisting>BOOT_ADMIN&gt; boot pri ipl</programlisting>
On most &PA; boxes, the system will ask you if you want to interact 
with <emphasis>IPL</emphasis> anyway. You just have to answer by a 
&quot;<keycap>y</keycap>&quot;. You will fall back to &PO; 
configuration display, with the list of all parameters and 
their corresponding numbers.
</para>
        <para>
You just have to enter the number corresponding to the 
parameter you want to change.
Hit <keycap>ENTER</keycap>, modify it and validate the 
changes by hiting <keycap>ENTER</keycap> again.
The system will redisplay the new list.
This modification is not permanent&nbsp;!
To save your changes, you will have to run <command>/sbin/palo</command> 
when your system will be up and running,
and it will write on the disk all the parameters contained in 
the default file, (<filename>/etc/palo.conf</filename>), which 
you will have properly modified if needed.
If you want to add a supplementary parameter, select any one 
and write yours on the editing line, beginning with a space&nbsp;:
        <programlisting>
Edit which field?
(or 'b' to boot with this command line)? 0  
3/boot/vmlinux initrd=root.bin
</programlisting>
After validation, the list will count one more parameter.
If you want to delete one, select it and erase the complete entry.
You will see that the list counts one less parameter.
</para>
        <para>
For more informations about &PO;, please take look at the
<ulink url="http://cvs.parisc-linux.org/~checkout~/palo/README.html?rev=HEAD">&PO; readme</ulink>.
This section is mostly inspired from Paul Bame's file as 
well as the page about &PO; you can find at

        <title>A complete example</title>
        <para>
This example has been suggested by <emphasis>Michael Damaschke</emphasis>.
So, let's go for the story of the happy &PL; user booting a kernel,
also called &quot;<emphasis>I don't know how to configure my workstation 
to use the kernel I want during boot sequence&nbsp;!</emphasis>&quot;.
</para>
        <para>
After switching your workstation and monitor on, a message on the
screen will tell you that the workstation is about to start 
automatically the boot sequence, except if you hold the 
<keycap>Esc</keycap> key to stop the auto-booting.
This is a very difficult step&nbsp;: you must hold the 
<keycap>Esc</keycap> key down ;o) 
</para>
        <warning>
          <para>
Depending on your model, you might need to press this key 
during a quite long time.
</para>
        </warning>
        <tip>
          <para>In some cases, the monitor can be too slow to get on, and 
won't allow you to see the warning message. A good workaround is to 
keep a close eye on the keyboard's lights&nbsp;: when they blink, this is 
the right time to press and hold the <keycap>Esc</keycap> key.
If you still have troubles, please refer to the 
<emphasis>Consoles</emphasis> section.</para>
        </tip>
        <para>
There are few differences about the way to get access to 
&BA; (see <xref linkend="enterbootadmin"/>).
If you have an old box, you will get an information message displayed,
where the workstation's firmware tells you that it will 
start searching for all bootable devices,
or that you can break this by holding down the <keycap>Esc</keycap> key.
This is the same procedure as before, you must 
press the <keycap>Esc</keycap> key.
</para>
        <para>
You might then get a menu where you must press the 
<keycap>a</keycap>-key followed by <keycap>ENTER</keycap>-key.
You are now facing the deadly '<computeroutput>BOOT_ADMIN&gt;</computeroutput>'
prompt :^). First, we will turn off <literal>auto boot</literal> 
process by entering the following lines&nbsp;:
</para>
        <programlisting>
BOOT_ADMIN&gt; auto boot off
</programlisting>
        <para>
then hit the <keycap>ENTER</keycap> key.
</para>
        <para>
After that, you must tell the system from which boot device you 
would like to boot. If it's a hard drive, it must have a 
'<literal>f0</literal>' partition at the beginning 
(see <xref linkend="bootsolutions"/>).
</para>
        <para>
In this example, the old kernel is <filename>vmlinux</filename> and 
the new one is <filename>vmlinux-2.4.17-pa3</filename>.
The chosen SCSI boot device is designed by&nbsp;:
<computeroutput>
SCSI.<replaceable>X</replaceable>.0,
</computeroutput>
where <replaceable>X</replaceable> is the SCSI-ID of the disk you 
want to boot from.
<emphasis>e.g.</emphasis>
</para>
        <programlisting>
BOOT_ADMIN&gt; boot SCSI.5.0
</programlisting>
        <para>
At the end of the previous command line, you must add the 
<parameter>IPL</parameter> token if you have a HP 9000/7xx 
system to specify that you want to interact with 
<application>IPL</application>. If you have a more 
recent hardware, the system will ask if you want to 
interact with <application>IPL</application> anyway&nbsp;:
        <programlisting>
Interact with IPL (Y or N)?&gt;
</programlisting>
Now, you can manually configure the &PO; booting parameters.
You can see a new menu, where you can configure on line 
'<computeroutput>0</computeroutput>' (selected by default)
the boot partition number, and the path of your boot kernel.
</para>
        <para>
Here is the complete session log of a A500 serial console output&nbsp;:

&PO; was first setup to boot the kernel file <filename>vmlinux</filename> 
located on the third partition of the SCSI device ID 5 LUN 0.
(We know this since we have asked &BA; to boot on this device).
But we wanted another kernel this time.
We have pressed the <keycap>ENTER</keycap> key (to validate the default 
choice '<computeroutput>0</computeroutput>')
and modify the text to match our needs, here 
<filename>vmlinux-2.4.17-pa3</filename>. We have also 
added an <computeroutput>initrd=0/root.bin</computeroutput> argument 
to the command line. We have validated our changes 
by hitting the <keycap>ENTER</keycap> key.
Finally we have decided that we didn't want this 
additional argument, so we have selected it and erased it.
At the end it asked again which field we wanted to edit, we 
have just put '<computeroutput>b</computeroutput>' instead 
of any number and hit <keycap>ENTER</keycap> to boot our new kernel.

There are two options from there&nbsp;: either you know the full <literal>PATH</literal> to your CD device,

In this last case, issue a <command>search ipl</command> to list all available devices with <literal>IPL</literal>.
You can also specify a <command>search <replaceable>[PATH]</replaceable></command>, which is fastest.
For instance if you want to search the SCSI bus:
</para>

search SCSI
</programlisting>
          <para>
On recent boxes, <command>search disk</command> is quite helpful.

      <title>Kernel configuration</title>
      <para>
If you want to take advantage of the latest kernel improvements, we 
suggest you to retrieve it from the official 
<ulink url="http://cvs.parisc-linux.org/">&PA;/Linux CVS</ulink>. You 
can of course either download it from 
<ulink url="http://www.kernel.org/">http://www.kernel.org/</ulink>, or 
use the &D; package, but we will focus on a fresh CVS tree.

      <para>
The best way to obtain appreciable performances is to get a well 
configured kernel. For the &PA; platform, <command>make oldconfig</command> 
is a kind of default setup. If you want to make your own kernel, 
the first step is to know what hardware you have. The best way to 
grab useful info is to look at your box and find a maximum of data 
(model name, partnumber, chipsets, and so on). If you have already 
booted your box, you can take a look at <command>dmesg</command> 
output. Then, go to the <ulink url="http://hwdb.parisc-linux.org/">official 
hardware database</ulink> or to the 
<ulink url="http://partsurfer.hp.com/">HP partsurfer website</ulink>.
</para>
      <para>
Once you know what is inside your box and what you want to do with it,
just run <command>make menuconfig</command> or another config command.
Here is a brief list of architecture dependent menus for 2.4 kernels.
You should take a look at them, to see if the values set correspond 
to your hardware&nbsp;:

As you see, menus specifically concerned by &PA; hardware are not 
that numerous, but there are lots of dependencies between them. Now, 
you must configure the kernel accordingly to what you plan to use 
this box for. Here is a list of some menus you should be going

      <para>
When you're done with it, save your kernel configuration.
Everything is written in the <filename>.config</filename> file.
You should back it up because a <command>make distclean</command> 
will remove it. At this very stage, you can do 
<command>make dep vmlinux</command> and if everything goes fine, 
you will have a new kernel in a couple of minutes.

      <title>Kernel installation</title>
      <para>
If you have made a native build on the box you wish to install, you can setup 
the new kernel as follows&nbsp;:
within the kernel source tree <filename>linux/</filename>, as root do a&nbsp;:
      <programlisting>
bash# cp vmlinux /boot/vmlinux-<replaceable>[kernelversion]</replaceable>
bash# cp System.map /boot/System.map-<replaceable>[kernelversion]</replaceable>
bash# cp .config /boot/config-<replaceable>[kernelversion]</replaceable>
</programlisting>
Though it is not mandatory, we suggest you to replace 
<replaceable>[kernelversion]</replaceable> by the version of the 
kernel you built, <emphasis>e.g.</emphasis>&nbsp;: 
<filename>vmlinux-2.4.18-pa44</filename>. This will help you 
dealing with multiple kernel versions on the same machine.
The same applies to <filename>.config</filename>.
It is not needed to have a working kernel, though it might 
be very helpful when configuring a new one.
Now, do a <command>cd /boot</command>, make sure that 
<filename>vmlinux</filename> is a symbolic link to another 
file, as in the following example&nbsp;:
      <programlisting>
bash# ls -l vmlinux
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root   root   35 Jun 23 01:38 vmlinux -&gt; vmlinux-2.4.18-64-SMP
</programlisting>
Make sure to remember the name of the kernel actually running 
on your box if ever the new one won't work properly.
You are now able to ask &PO; to boot on it if needed 
(see <xref linkend="palo"/> for more information).
Now do the following&nbsp;:
      <programlisting>
bash# rm -f vmlinux
bash# ln -s vmlinux-<replaceable>[kernelversion]</replaceable> vmlinux
bash# sync
</programlisting>
If you want to boot from network you can forget all this, 
as you will need to set &PO; as explained in the 
<xref linkend="paloappusage"/>, and run <command>make palo</command> 
to create the bootable <emphasis>lifimage</emphasis>.
</para>
      <para>
If you have made a cross-compiled build or built a kernel on a 
PA box which is not the one you wish to install,
you have to find a way to put <filename>vmlinux</filename>, 
<filename>System.map</filename> and <filename>.config</filename> 
in <filename class="directory">/boot</filename> as mentionned before.
You can use the network (like <command>ftp</command>) 
or a CD to do so, or even direct copy to the hard disk drive.
