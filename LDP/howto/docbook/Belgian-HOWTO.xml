			<title>Why this document?</title>
			<para>
Since there was no information anywhere on the net for Belgian Linux
users around 1998, we started to collect stuff that we thought could
be important.
This HOWTO aims to be the definitive list of all Belgian-related Linux
information. If you think not, you have no excuse to complain and
certainly not to not contribute. ;)

		<section>
			<title>The Linux.be-domain debacle</title>
			<para>
As you might have heard, Belgium also has its problem with the Linux.be
domain. Similar to the Linux.nl case. Around March 1999, someone tricked
the DNS administration about the trademark 'Linux' in Belgium by using
'Linux' as a commercial representation of the company ('uithangbord')
which was according to the rules of the DNS administration at that time.
The company in fact was one that sold motor-parts and the registration was
done with a fake fax containing a penguin.
			</para>

			<para>
It is sad that the person who registered the Linux.be-domain name,
did this behind the back of some Open Source volunteers who
were planning to register a not-for-profit organisation to hold the domain
name to prevent any abuse.
			</para>

			<para>
Afterwards there were several meetings with this person to work out an
agreement so that the domain was not used for commercial purposes and
handed over to a neutral organisation. But after several attempts it
was very clear that the owner wanted full control over the domain, which
he later emphasized by 'handing it over' to his own not-for-profit
organisation. He stated several times he wanted to keep the right to add
advertissements to the website, but wouldn't mind that volunteers added
content to the site (that was empty at the time). After this, no one was
willing to work voluntarily for the content of the site. Sadly he managed
to get some people volunteer for it after all.

			<title>Keyboard setup</title>
			<para>
Linux provides 2 ways to set up your keyboard. At the console you can
use <command>loadkeys</command> and under 
<application>XFree86</application> you can use
<command>xmodmap</command>.
			</para>
 
			<section>
				<title>Console</title>
				<para>
To use the keytable for a Belgian keyboard you can use
<userinput>loadkeys be2-latin1</userinput> or
<userinput>loadkeys be-latin1</userinput>.
The only difference between the two is that be2-latin1 adds support
for twosuperior and threesuperior (keycode 41) and grave (keycode 43).
				</para>

				<para>
Usually <command>loadkeys</command> is started at boottime from the
scripts located somewhere in 
<filename class="directory">/etc/rc.d</filename>.
Different distributions handle it differently. Most distributions
have a simple program (like <command>kbdconfig</command> in Red Hat, 
<command>install-keymap</command> in Debian or
<command>yast</command> in SuSE) to change the behaviour of these 
scripts.
				</para>
			</section>

			<section>
				<title>XFree86</title>
				<para>
To set your keyboard properly under <application>XFree86</application>
you've got more choices. 
By running <command>Xconfigurator</command> (or a similar program) a
config-file for <application>XFree86</application> is created (with
some standard behaviour). This file is called 
<filename>XF86Config-4</filename> or <filename>XF86Config</filename>
and is usually located in 
<filename class="directory">/etc/X11</filename> or 
<filename class="directory">/etc</filename>
				</para>

				<para>
Make sure (and change otherwise) that something similar to this is
given under the <emphasis>Keyboard Section</emphasis>.
<screen>
	Section "Keyboard"
		Protocol        "Standard"
		XkbRules        "xfree86"
		XkbModel        "pc101"
		XkbLayout       "be"
	EndSection
</screen>
				</para>

				<para>
If you own a 'microsoft' keyboard (or the less-known penguin
keyboards ;p) you can enable those extra 3 keys by changing the
<emphasis>"pc101"</emphasis> into <emphasis>"pc104"</emphasis>.
(I use the extra keys as meta-keys in my windowmanager so some
shortcuts don't conflict with the internal ones of my wm).
				</para>

				<para>
To get the AltGr key to work under <application>XFree86</application>
simply add in the <emphasis>Keyboard Section:</emphasis>

<screen>
	RightAlt        ModeShift
</screen>
				</para>
			</section>

			<section>
				<title>Compose key</title>
				<para>
Some people prefer to use a 'Compose'-key to enter their special characters, like:

<screen>
	<keycombo><keysym>Compose</keysym><keycap>'</keycap></keycombo> <keycap>e</keycap>    =&gt;    &eacute;
	<keycombo><keysym>Compose</keysym><keycap>/</keycap></keycombo> <keycap>o</keycap>    =&gt;    &oslash;
	<keycombo><keysym>Compose</keysym><keycap>c</keycap></keycombo> <keycap>,</keycap>    =&gt;    &ccedil;
	<keycombo><keysym>Compose</keysym><keycap>c</keycap></keycombo> <keycap>o</keycap>    =&gt;    &copy;
	<keycombo><keysym>Compose</keysym><keycap>s</keycap></keycombo> <keycap>s</keycap>    =&gt;    &szlig;
</screen>

For XFree86, the solution is to enter <userinput>xmodmap -e "keycode xx = Multi_key"</userinput>
or <userinput>xmodmap -e "keysym yy = Multi_key"</userinput>
where 'xx' is the keycode or 'yy' the keysym of the key you choose to
be the 'Compose'-key.
(use <command>xev</command> to get these values)
				</para>

				<para>
Alternatively you can add <userinput>keycode xx = Multi_key</userinput>
to your <filename>~/.xmodmaprc</filename>. This way it happens automagically.
				</para>

				<para>
For the console, you could do something similar with loadkeys.
<userinput>echo "altgr keycode 52 = Compose" | loadkeys</userinput> to use 
<keycombo><keysym>AltGr</keysym><keycap>/</keycap></keycombo> as a 'Compose'-key.
				</para>
			</section>
		</section>

		<section>
			<title>Display and applications</title>
			<para>
Some applications have to be compiled as 8-bit clean to work well
with the European characterset. Others like to be told in advance.
			</para>

			<section>
				<title>Using the ISO-8859-1 font in console</title>
				<para>
You can load the ISO-8859-1 font by typing the following in console:
<screen>
	setfont lat1u-16.psf
	mapscrn trivial
	echo -ne '\033(K'
</screen>
				</para>

				<para>
To be able to use &euml;, &egrave;, &eacute; or &ccedil; in console,
you might want to add these to your <filename>~/.inputrc</filename>:
<screen>
	set meta-flag on
	set convert-meta off
	set output-meta on
</screen>

(This must be done for every user, if you want this to be default for
all users you can either add this file to 
<filename class="directory">/etc/skel/</filename> or you could add 
these lines to <filename>/etc/inputrc</filename> and add the
following to <filename>/etc/bashrc</filename>,
<userinput>export INPUTRC=/etc/inputrc</userinput>)
				</para>

				<note>
					<title>Note!</title>
					<para>
This is only useful to programs that use readline 
(like <application>bash</application>)
					</para>
				</note>

				<para>
Also set the following environment variables:

<screen>
	LC_CTYPE=iso-8859-1
	SYSFONT=lat1u-16.psf
	SYSTERM=linux
</screen>
				</para>
			</section>

			<section>
				<title>Support for the Euro symbol</title>
				<para>
Since Europe had to invent a new character, the Euro, there's a new 
standard. It's called ISO-8859-15 (aka Latin-9 or Latin-0). To add
support you need both a new font and new keymaps.  This is part of
every major distribution nowadays, if you have an older distributions
you probably need a newer <emphasis>console-tools</emphasis> package.
				</para>

				<para>
There's more information in the 
<ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/mini/Euro-Char-Support/">Euro Character Support mini HOWTO</ulink>

		<section>
			<title>Time zone</title>
			<para>
Since Belgium is located in the Central European Time zone (aka MET)
which (in the winter) is equivalent to the Greenwhich Mean Time plus 1
(GMT+1), you can simply link 
<filename>/usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime/MET</filename> to 
<filename class="symlink">/etc/localtime</filename> symbolicly like: 

<userinput>
	ln -sf /usr/lib/zoneinfo/MET /etc/localtime
</userinput>
or 
<userinput>
	ln -sf /usr/lib/zoneinfo/Europe/Brussels /etc/localtime
</userinput>

This automagically sets Daylight Savings (which is GMT+2 in the
summer). 
		</para>

		<note>
			<title>Note!</title>
			<para>
Different distributions have different paths,
zoneinfo can be located in 
<filename class="directory">/usr/share</filename> or such...
			</para>
		</note>

		<note>
			<title>Another note!</title>
			<para>
Red Hat uses a tool called <command>timeconfig</command>, 
SuSE uses <command>yast</command>
			</para>
		</note>

		<para>
To change the <acronym>CMOS</acronym> clock and then synchronize the
system time with the <acronym>CMOS</acronym> clock, do something like
this: 

<screen>
	hwclock --set --date="Feb 25 03:38"
	clock -u -s
</screen>

If your clock is set to local time (which is discouraged but if you
also run broken OS's, you must), you can do: 

<screen>
	hwclock --set --date="Feb 25 04:38"
	clock -s
</screen>

[Noticed the 1 hour difference ? ;p] 
		</para>

		<para>
If your computer has Internet-access you can use 
<acronym>NTP</acronym> (Network Time Protocol) to keep your system
clock in sync. One way of doing this is by starting ntpdate from 
<application>cron</application> by adding

<screen>
	05 0 * * * root /usr/sbin/ntpdate -s ntp.belnet.be &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
</screen>

to your <emphasis>/etc/crontab</emphasis>. Check the 
<acronym>ISP</acronym>-information below to see if your
<acronym>ISP</acronym> has a <acronym>NTP</acronym>-server available.

locale or how to write your own programs to support it, check: 
[put the damn url here ;p]
		</para>

		<para>
Be aware that locale makes it harder to resolve problems as less
people can help you !! You might understand a problem when it's in
technical English, but what if it's translated in some obscure
Dutch ?
		</para>

		<section>
			<title>Dutch</title>
				<para>
To enable support for the Dutch locale in Belgium on a system with
locale support you just have to set the following environment
variables: 

<screen>
	LANG=nl
	LANGUAGE=nl_BE

The pppd command uses <filename>/etc/ppp/options</filename> to list
its options, change these options to whatever fits. These defaults
normally work in most cases.

It is important to emphasize that every special
character, thus every character that is not [a-ZA-Z0-9] and '_', 
should be escaped by preceding it with a '\'-character. 
Thus "e!b$l+" would become "e\!b\$l\+".
Try it if you are having troubles !

Before you can run a (shell)script, it must be set executable. Be sure
that you set the permissions so that other users cannot see the

dial in, you might want to consider using <command>sudo</command>.
You might want to do the following:

This section does not aim to be a definitive guide on ISDN for Linux. 
For a more detailed discussion on the topic, see

				<section>
					<title>Updating the kernel</title>
				<para>
If you're using a 2.2 kernel, it's recommended to get an updated
version of the <acronym>ISDN</acronym> code. You can retrieve it 
from <application>CVS</application> at 
<ulink url="ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/isdn4linux/"></ulink>. 
For more information, check: 
<ulink url="http://www.brisse.dk/site/linux/docs/isdn.htm"></ulink>
					</para>

					<warning><para>
If you've recently purchased an Eicon Diva 2.0 PCI
(eg, via Belgacom), there's a good chance you've actually got a 
Diva 2.01.In this case, you must get a version dated 1 July 1999 or
later !
					</para></warning>

					<para>
Once the <acronym>ISDN</acronym> is in place, you can start up the
driver. Eg: <userinput>modprobe hisax type=11 protocol=2</userinput>
Refer to the Readme's for the right parameters and values for your
card. 
					</para>

				<section>
					<title>ISDN4Linux toolkit</title>

Next, you'll need the ISDN4Linux toolkit.  You can retrieve the latest

				<section>
					<title>Configuring the interface</title>
					<para>
With the tools installed and configured, write a script to configure
the interface, to be used for the <acronym>ISDN</acronym> connection.
As always in Linux, there's no one correct way of doing this. I've
put these in a script 
					</para>
  
					<para>
<filename>/etc/rc.d/rc.isdn</filename>:
<screen>
	#!/bin/sh

	MSNREMOTE='555-1212'    # Phone number of ISP
	MSNLOCAL='555-1313'     # my number, without 0, with areacode
	ACCOUNT='george'        # The account for logon (as 'George Burns')
	IPLOCAL=10.0.0.2        # my fixed IP (use 10.0.0.2 if no fixed)
	IPREMOTE=0.0.0.0        # IP number of ISP
	INTERFACE=ippp0
	/sbin/modprobe hisax type=11 protocol=2
	/sbin/isdnctrl verbose 3 system on
	/sbin/isdnctrl addif $IF
	/sbin/isdnctrl secure $IF on 
	/sbin/isdnctrl addphone $IF out $MSNREMOTE
	/sbin/isdnctrl eaz $IF $MSNLOCAL
	/sbin/isdnctrl huptimeout $IF 300
	/sbin/isdnctrl l2_prot $IF hdlc
	/sbin/isdnctrl l3_prot $IF trans
	/sbin/isdnctrl encap $IF syncppp
	/sbin/isdnctrl dialmode $IF auto
	/sbin/ifconfig $IF $IPLOCAL pointopoint $IPREMOTE -arp -broadcast
	/sbin/ipppd /dev/ippp0 user $ACCOUNT $IPLOCAL:$IPREMOTE
</screen>
					</para>

					<para>
To start this at boot time, make it executable and append the
following to <filename>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</filename>:

<screen>
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.isdn ]; then
		. /etc/rc.d/rc.isdn
	fi
</screen>
					</para>

					<para>
The <command>ipppd</command> command gets its parameters passed
through a file, <filename>/etc/ppp/ioptions</filename>:

<screen>
	-ac
	-bsdcomp
	debug
	defaultroute
	ipcp-accept-local
	ipcp-accept-remote
	mru 1524
	mtu 1500
	noipdefault
	-pc
	useifip
	-vj
	-vjccomp

	#idle 360
	#persistent
</screen>
					</para>

					<warning><para>
Do NOT specify +pap or +chap in this file. This
specifies the authentication that ipppd should use for an INCOMING
client. If you were to use this to connect to your ISP, ipppd would
wait for the ISP to authenticate itself using the specified protocol.
					</para></warning>

					<warning><para>
It is important to emphasize that every special
character, thus every character that is not [a-ZA-Z0-9] and '_'
should be escaped by preceding it with a '\'-character. Thus 'e!b$l+'
would become 'e\!b\$l\+'.  Try it if you are having troubles !
					</para></warning>

					<para>
Finally, create <filename>/etc/ppp/ip-down.local</filename> to handle
the shutdown of the interface:

<screen>
	#!/bin/sh

	/sbin/ifconfig $1 down
	sleep 1
	/sbin/ifconfig $1 10.0.0.2 pointopoint 
</screen>
					</para>

					<note>
						<title>Note!</title>
						<para>
This is to handle some problems with routes on
shutdowns.  Anyone know of a clean(er) solution ?
						</para>
					</note>
				</section>

				<section>
					<title>pap-secrets / chap-secrets</title>
					<para>
If your ISP uses PAP or CHAP, create a file 
<filename>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</filename> or
<filename>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</filename>. Its format is:
<screen>
	#client         server  secret          IP      
	your_login      *       your_pass       *
</screen>
					</para>
				</section>

				<section>
					<title>Network</title>
					<para>
Not really related to <acronym>ISDN</acronym>, but a lot of people
forget this step (too eager to try out all the stuff they typed in
above ? :-)).
					</para>

					<para>
Anyway, you need to configure the DNS, by creating a file 
<filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>:
<screen>
	domain your_domain_of_your_isp
	nameserver your_primary_nameserver
	nameserver your_secondary_nameserver
</screen>
					</para>
				</section>

				<section>
					<title>File permissions</title>
					<para>
Before you can run a (shell)script, it must be set executable. Be sure
that you set the permissions so that other users cannot see the
passwords stored in the files. If you want other users to be able to
dial in, you might want to consider using <command>sudo</command>.
You might want to do the following:

<screen>
	chmod u+rw og-rwx -r /etc/ppp
	chmod u+x /etc/rc.d/rc.isdn /etc/ppp/ip.down-local /usr/local/bin/isdn
</screen>
					</para>
				</section>

				<section>
					<title>Dial + Hangup</title>
					<para>
Finally, you can write a little wrapper to start and stop the ISDN 
connection. I've put this as <command>/usr/local/bin/isdn</command>:

<screen>
	#!/bin/bash
	
	case $1 in
		(on|start)
			/sbin/isdnctrl dial ippp0
			;;
		(off|stop)
			/sbin/isdnctrl hangup ippp0
			;;
		(info|status)
			/sbin/isdnctrl list ippp0
			;;
		(*)
			echo "Usage: isdn on|off|info|start|stop|status"
	esac
</screen>
					</para>

					<para>
Then if <filename class="directory">/usr/local/bin</filename> is in
your <envar>PATH</envar>, you can easily dial in with
<userinput>isdn on</userinput> and hangup with 
<userinput>isdn off</userinput>.
					</para>

			<title>HOWTO translations</title>
			<para>
As Dutch is less wide-spread, it is the least supported. But work is
being done to resolve this ;) (and maybe *you* can help ?!?) French
and German translations obviously are already taken care of.

				<title>Dutch</title>
				<para>
A succesfull initiative is making progress, but there's still a lot
to do. If you want to help, start translating and send it there.

			<title>IRC</title>
			<para>
The fastest medium to get support is <acronym>IRC</acronym>, but
beware. Because <acronym>IRC</acronym> is rather anonymous it's also
easy to deceive people.
			</para>

			<para>
On IRCnet there's a channel called #linux.be that is closely related
to bcol and the Belgian Linux-scene. The channel is still small, but
it surely will grow in time. To get help in English, there's only one
place #linux.
			</para>

			<para>
Also Dalnet has a #linux.be channel.
