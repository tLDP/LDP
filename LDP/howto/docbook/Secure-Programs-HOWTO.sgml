<para>
This paper describes a set of design and implementation guidelines for
writing secure programs on Linux and Unix systems.
For purposes of this paper, a ``secure program'' is a program
that sits on a security boundary, taking input from a source that does
not have the same access rights as the program.
Such programs include application programs used as viewers of remote data,
web applications (including CGI scripts),
network servers, and setuid/setgid programs.
This paper does not address modifying the operating system kernel itself,
although many of the principles discussed here do apply.
These guidelines were developed as a survey of
``lessons learned'' from various sources on how to create such programs
(along with additional observations by the author),
reorganized into a set of larger principles.
This paper includes specific guidance for a number of languages,
including C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, TCL, and Ada95.
</para>

<para>
This paper does not cover assurance measures, software engineering
processes, and quality assurance approaches,
which are important but widely discussed elsewhere.
Such measures include testing, peer review,
configuration management, and formal methods.
Documents specifically identifying sets of development
assurance measures for security issues include
the Common Criteria [CC 1999]
and the
System Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model [SSE-CMM 1999].
More general sets of software engineering methods or processes
are defined in documents such as the
Software Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model for Software
(SE-CMM), ISO 9000 (along with ISO 9001 and ISO 9001-3), and ISO 12207.
<!-- ??? Ideally have references for these. -->
</para>

<para>
This paper does not discuss how to configure a system (or network)
to be secure in a given environment. This is clearly necessary for
secure use of a given program,
but a great many other documents discuss secure configurations.
An excellent general book on configuring Unix-like systems to be
secure is Garfinkel [1996].
Other books for securing Unix-like systems include Anonymous [1998].
You can also find information on configuring Unix-like systems at web sites
such as
<ulink url="http://www.unixtools.com/security.html">http://www.unixtools.com/security.html</ulink>.
Information on configuring a Linux system to be secure is available in a
wide variety of documents including
Fenzi [1999], Seifried [1999], Wreski [1998], and Anonymous [1999].
For Linux systems (and eventually other Unix-like systems),
you may want to examine the Bastille Hardening System, which
attempts to ``harden'' or ``tighten'' the Linux operating system. 
You can learn more about Bastille at
<ulink url="http://www.bastille-linux.org">http://www.bastille-linux.org</ulink>;

</para>

<para>
This paper assumes that the reader understands computer
security issues in general, the general security model of Unix-like systems,
and the C programming language.
This paper does include some information about the Linux and Unix
programming model for security.
</para>

<para>
This paper covers all Unix-like systems, including Linux and the
various strains of Unix, and it particularly stresses Linux and provides
details about Linux specifically.
There are several reasons for this, but a simple reason is popularity.
According to a 1999 survey by IDC,
significantly more servers (counting both Internet and intranet servers)
were installed in 1999 with Linux than with all
Unix operating system types combined (25% for Linux versus
15% for all Unix system types combined; note that
Windows NT came in with 38% compared to the 40% of all Unix-like servers)
[Shankland 2000].
<!-- http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-1549312.html -->
A survey by Zoebelein in April 1999 found that, of the total number of
servers deployed on the Internet in 1999
(running at least ftp, news, or http (WWW)), the majority were running
Linux (28.5%), with others trailing (24.4% for all Windows 95/98/NT
combined, 17.7% for Solaris or SunOS,
15% for the BSD family, and 5.3% for IRIX).
Advocates will notice that the majority of servers on the Internet
(around 66%) were running Unix-like
systems, while only around 24% ran a Microsoft Windows variant.
<!-- http://www.leb.net/hzo/ioscount -->
<!-- Other surveys of the Internet are interesting but don't shed light
     on this issue.  E.G. The Internet Domain Survey at http://www.isc.org/ds
     tries to find every host, but doesn't id who runs what -->
Finally, the original version of this document only discussed Linux, so
although its scope has expanded, the Linux information is still
noticeably dominant.

-->
<para>
The design and implementation guidelines are divided into
categories which I believe emphasize the programmer's viewpoint.
Programs accept inputs, process data, call out to other resources,
and produce output; notionally all security guidelines
fit into one of these categories.
I've divided processing data into further categories:
avoiding buffer overflows (which in some cases can also be considered
an input issue),
structuring program internals and approach,
language-specific information, and special topics.
The actual chapter layout was reordered slightly to be easier to follow.
Thus, the document chapters on guidelines discuss
validating all input (<xref linkend="input">),
avoiding buffer overflows (<xref linkend="buffer-overflow">),
structuring program internals and approach (<xref linkend="internals">),
carefully calling out to other resources (<xref linkend="call-out">),
judiciously sending information back (<xref linkend="output">),
language-specific information (<xref linkend="language-specific">),
and finally information on special topics such as how to acquire random
numbers (<xref linkend="special">).

<title>History of Unix, Linux, and Open Source / Free Software</title>

<sect2 id="unix-history">
<title>Unix</title>

<para>
In 1969-1970, Kenneth Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others at
AT&amp;T Bell Labs began developing
a small operating system on a little-used PDP-7.
The operating system was soon christened Unix, a pun on an earlier operating
system project called MULTICS.
In 1972-1973 the system was rewritten in the programming language C,
an unusual step that was visionary: due to this decision, Unix was
the first widely-used operating system that
could switch from and outlive its original hardware.
Other innovations were added to Unix as well, in part due to synergies
between Bell Labs and the academic community.
In 1979, the ``seventh edition'' (V7) version
of Unix was released, the grandfather of all extant Unix systems.
</para>

<para>
After this point, the history of Unix becomes somewhat convoluted.
The academic community, led by Berkeley, developed a variant called the
Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), while AT&amp;T continued developing
Unix under the names ``System III'' and later ``System V''.
In the late 1980's through early 1990's
the ``wars'' between these two major strains raged.
After many years each variant adopted many of the key features of the other.
Commercially, System V won the ``standards wars'' (getting most of its
interfaces into the formal standards), and
most hardware vendors switched to AT&amp;T's System V.
However, System V ended up incorporating many BSD innovations, so the
resulting system was more a merger of the two branches.
The BSD branch did not die, but instead became widely used
for research, for PC hardware, and for
single-purpose servers (e.g., many web sites use a BSD derivative).
</para>

<para>
The result was many different versions of Unix,
all based on the original seventh edition.
Most versions of Unix were proprietary and maintained by their respective
hardware vendor, for example, Sun Solaris is a variant of System V.
Three versions of the BSD branch of Unix ended up as open source:
FreeBSD (concentating on ease-of-installation for PC-type hardware),
NetBSD (concentrating on many different CPU architectures), and
a variant of NetBSD, OpenBSD (concentrating on security).

<title>Free Software Foundation</title>

<para>
In 1984 Richard Stallman's Free Software Foundation (FSF) began the GNU
project, a project to create a free version of the Unix operating system.
By free, Stallman meant software that could be freely
used, read, modified, and redistributed.
The FSF successfully built a vast number of
useful components, including a C compiler (gcc), an
impressive text editor (emacs), and a host of fundamental tools.
However, in the 1990's the FSF
was having trouble developing the operating system kernel [FSF 1998];
without a kernel the rest of their software would not work.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="linux-history">
<title>Linux</title>

<para>
In 1991 Linus Torvalds began developing an operating system kernel, which
he named ``Linux'' [Torvalds 1999].
This kernel could be combined with the FSF material and other components
(in particular some of the BSD components and MIT's X-windows software) to
produce a freely-modifiable and very useful operating system.
This paper will term the kernel itself the ``Linux kernel'' and
an entire combination as ``Linux''.
Note that many use the term ``GNU/Linux'' instead for this combination.
</para>

<para>
In the Linux community,
different organizations have combined the available components differently.
Each combination is called a ``distribution'', and the organizations that
develop distributions are called ``distributors''.
Common distributions include Red Hat, Mandrake, SuSE, Caldera, Corel,
and Debian.
There are differences between the various distributions,
but all distributions are based on the same foundation: the
Linux kernel and the GNU glibc libraries.
Since both are covered by ``copyleft'' style licenses, changes to
these foundations generally must be made available to all, a
unifying force between the Linux distributions at their foundation
that does not exist between the BSD and AT&amp;T-derived Unix systems.
This paper is not specific to any Linux distribution; when it
discusses Linux it presumes Linux
kernel version 2.2 or greater and the C library glibc 2.1 or greater,
valid assumptions for essentially all current major
Linux distributions.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="oss-history">
<title>Open Source / Free Software</title>

<para>
Increased interest in software that is freely shared
has made it increasingly necessary to define and explain it.
A widely used term is ``open source software'', which is further defined in
[OSI 1999].
Eric Raymond [1997, 1998] wrote several seminal articles examining
its various development processes.
Another widely-used term is ``free software'', where the ``free''
is short for ``freedom'': the usual explanation is ``free speech, not
free beer.''
Neither phrase is perfect.
The term
``free software'' is often confused with programs whose executables are
given away at no charge, but whose source code cannot be viewed, modified,
or redistributed.
Conversely, the term ``open source'' is sometime (ab)used
to mean software whose
source code is visible, but for which there are limitations on
use, modification, or redistribution.
This paper uses the term ``open source'' for its usual meaning, that
is, software which has its source code freely available for
use, viewing, modification, and redistribution; a more detailed
definition is contained in the
<ulink
url="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html">Open Source Definition</ulink>.
In some cases, a difference in motive is suggested;
those preferring the term ``free software'' wish to strongly
emphasize the need for freedom, while those using the term may have
other motives (e.g., higher reliability) or simply wish to appear less
strident.
For information on this definition of free software, and
the motivations behind it, can be found at
<ulink url="http://www.fsf.org">http://www.fsf.org</ulink>.

and free software should see
<ulink

<ulink

There are other papers which examine such software, for example,
Miller [1995]
found that the open source software were noticeably
more reliable than proprietary software
(using their measurement technique, which measured
resistance to crashing due to random input).
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="linux-vs-unix">
<title>Comparing Linux and Unix</title>

<para>
This paper uses the term ``Unix-like'' to describe
systems intentionally like Unix.
In particular, the term ``Unix-like'' includes
all major Unix variants and Linux distributions.
</para>

<para>
Linux is not derived from Unix source code, but its interfaces are
intentionally like Unix.
Therefore, Unix lessons learned generally apply to both, including information
on security.
Most of the information in this paper applies to any Unix-like system.
Linux-specific information has been intentionally added to
enable those using Linux to take advantage of Linux's capabilities.
</para>

<para>
Unix-like systems share a number of security mechanisms, though there
are subtle differences and not all systems have all mechanisms available.
All include user and group ids (uids and gids) for each process and
a filesystem with read, write, and execute permissions (for user, group, and
other).
<!-- ???: Most include System V single-machine
     inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms
      and BSD's socket-based IPC (which support networks). -->

</sect1>

<sect1 id="security-principles">
<title>Security Principles</title>

<para>
There are many general security principles which you should be
familiar with; consult a general text on computer security such as
[Pfleeger 1997].
Often computer security goals are described in terms of three
overall goals:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<para>
<emphasis remap="it">Confidentiality</emphasis> (also known as secrecy), meaning that the
computing system's assets are accessible only by authorized parties.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
<emphasis remap="it">Integrity</emphasis>, meaning that the assets can only be modified by
authorized parties in authorized ways.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
<emphasis remap="it">Availability</emphasis>, meaning that the assets are accessible to the
authorized parties.
This goal is often referred to by its antonym, denial of service.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>


Some people define additional security goals, while others lump those
additional goals as special cases of these three goals.
For example, some separately
identify non-repudiation as a goal; this is
the ability to ``prove'' that a sender sent or receiver received a message,
even if the sender or receiver wishes to deny it later.
Privacy is sometimes addressed separately from confidentiality;
some define this as protecting the confidentiality of a
<emphasis>user</emphasis> (e.g., their identity) instead of the data.
Most goals require identification and authentication, which is
sometimes listed as a separate goal.
Often auditing (also called accountability) is identified
as a desirable security goal.
Sometimes ``access control''  and ``authenticity'' are listed separately
as well.
In any case, it is important to identify your program's overall
security goals, no matter how you group those goals together,
so that you'll know when you've met them.

 -->

<para>
Saltzer [1974] and later Saltzer and Schroeder [1975]
list the following principles of the design of secure
protection systems, which are still valid:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<para>
<emphasis remap="it">Least privilege</emphasis>.
Each user and program should operate using the fewest privileges possible.
This principle limits the damage from an accident, error, or attack.
It also reduces the number of potential interactions among privileged programs,
so unintentional,
unwanted, or improper uses of privilege are less likely to occur. 
This idea can be extended to the internals of a program: only the smallest
portion of the program which needs those privileges should have them.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
<emphasis remap="it">Economy of mechanism</emphasis>.
The protection system's design should be simple and
small as possible.
In their words,
``techniques such as line-by-line inspection of software and physical
examination of hardware that implements protection mechanisms are necessary.
For such techniques to be successful, a small and simple design is essential.''
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
<emphasis remap="it">Open design</emphasis>.
The protection mechanism must not depend on attacker ignorance.
Instead, the mechanism should be public, depending on the secrecy of
relatively few (and easily changeable) items like passwords or private keys.
An open design makes extensive public scrutiny possible, and it also
makes it possible for users to convince themselves that the system about
to be used is adequate.
Frankly, it isn't realistic to try to maintain secrecy for a system that
is widely distributed;
decompilers and subverted hardware can quickly expose any ``secrets''
in an implementation.
Bruce Schneier argues that smart engineers should ``demand
open source code for anything related to security'',
as well as ensuring that it receives widespread review and that
any identified problems are fixed [Schneier 1999].
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
<emphasis remap="it">Complete mediation</emphasis>.
Every access attempt must be checked; position the mechanism
so it cannot be subverted.
For example, in a client-server model, generally the server must do all
access checking because users can build or modify their own clients.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
<emphasis remap="it">Fail-safe defaults (e.g., permission-based approach)</emphasis>.
The default should be denial of service, and the
protection scheme should then identify conditions under which
access is permitted.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
<emphasis remap="it">Separation of privilege</emphasis>.
Ideally, access to objects should depend on more than one condition, so
that defeating one protection system won't enable complete access.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
<emphasis remap="it">Least common mechanism</emphasis>.
Minimize the amount and
use of shared mechanisms (e.g. use of the /tmp or /var/tmp directories).
Shared objects provide potentially dangerous channels for information
flow and unintended interactions.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
<emphasis remap="it">Psychological acceptability / Easy to use</emphasis>.
The human interface must be designed for ease of use so users will routinely
and automatically use the protection mechanisms correctly.
Mistakes will be reduced if
the security mechanisms closely match the user's mental image of
his or her protection goals.
</para>
</listitem>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="types-of-programs">
<title>Types of Secure Programs</title>

<para>
Many different types of programs may need to be secure programs
(as the term is defined in this paper).
Some common types are:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Application programs used as viewers of remote data.
Programs used as viewers (such as word processors or file format viewers)
are often asked to view data sent remotely by an untrusted user
(this request may be automatically invoked by a web browser).
Clearly, the untrusted
user's input should not be allowed to cause the application
to run arbitrary programs.
It's usually unwise to support initialization macros (run when the data
is displayed); if you must, then you must create a secure sandbox
(a complex and error-prone task).
Be careful of issues such as buffer overflow, discussed in
<xref linkend="buffer-overflow">, which might
allow an untrusted user to force the viewer to run an arbitrary program.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Application programs used by the administrator (root).
Such programs shouldn't trust information that can be controlled
by non-administrators.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Local servers (also called daemons).
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Network-accessible servers (sometimes called network daemons).
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Web-based applications (including CGI scripts).
These are a special case of network-accessible servers, but they're
so common they deserve their own category.
Such programs are invoked indirectly via a web server, which filters out
some attacks but nevertheless leaves many attacks that must be withstood.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Applets (i.e., programs downloaded to the client for automatic execution).
This is something Java is especially famous for, though other languages
(such as Python) support mobile code as well.
There are several security viewpoints here; the implementor of the
applet infrastructure on the client side has to make sure that the
only operations allowed are ``safe'' ones, and the writer of an applet has
to deal with the problem of hostile hosts (in other words, you can't
normally trust the client).
There is some research attempting to deal with running applets on
hostile hosts, but frankly
I'm sceptical of the value of these approaches
and this subject is exotic enough that I don't cover it further here.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
setuid/setgid programs.
These programs are invoked by a local user and, when executed, are
immediately granted the privileges of the program's owner and/or
owner's group.
In many ways these are the hardest programs to secure, because so many
of their inputs are under the control of the untrusted user and some
of those inputs are not obvious.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

This paper merges the issues of these different types of program into
a single set.
The disadvantage of this approach is that some of the issues identified
here don't apply to all types of programs.
In particular, setuid/setgid programs have many surprising inputs and several
of the guidelines here only apply to them.
However, things are not so clear-cut, because 
a particular program may cut across these boundaries (e.g., a CGI script
may be setuid or setgid, or be configured in a way that has the same effect),
and some programs are divided into several executables each of which
can be considered a different ``type'' of program.
The advantage of considering all of these program types together is that we can
consider all issues without trying to apply an inappropriate category
to a program.
As will be seen, many of the principles apply to all programs that
need to be secured.
</para>

<para>
There is a slight bias in this paper towards programs written in
C, with some notes on other languages such as C++, Perl, Python, Ada95, and
Java.
This is because C is the most common language for
implementing secure programs on Unix-like systems
(other than CGI scripts, which tend to use Perl),
and most other languages' implementations call the C library.
This is not to imply that C is somehow the ``best'' language for this purpose,
and most of the principles described here apply regardless of the
programming language used.

<sect1 id="paranoia">
<title>Paranoia is a Virtue</title>

<para>
The primary difficulty in writing secure programs is that
writing them requires a different mindset, in short, a paranoid mindset.
The reason is that the impact of errors (also called defects or bugs)
can be profoundly different.
</para>

<para>
Normal non-secure programs have many errors.
While these errors are undesirable, these errors usually 
involve rare or unlikely situations, and if a user should stumble upon
one they will try to avoid using the tool that way in the future.
</para>

<para>
In secure programs, the situation is reversed.
Certain users will intentionally search out and cause rare or unlikely
situations, in the hope that such attacks will give them unwarranted privileges.
As a result, when writing secure programs, paranoia is a virtue.

(interview with  Theo de Raadt,
head of the OpenBSD project, which is focused on security.
The problem with professional programmers is not a lack of ability,
but lack of attention to detail, he said.
...
The secret is straightforward - de Raadt and his peers assume that
every single bug found in the code occurs elsewhere.
de Raadt admits it sounds simple, but just rooting security bugs
out of the entire source tree took 10 full-time developers
one and a half years to complete.
"It?s a hell of a lot of work and I think that explains why it hasn't
been done by many people," he said.  www.openbsd.org.

<para>
One question I've been asked is ``why did you write this document''?
Here's my answer:
Over the last several years I've noticed that many developers for
Linux and Unix
seem to keep falling into the same security pitfalls, again and again.
Auditors were slowly catching problems, but it would have been better
if the problems weren't put into the code in the first place.
I believe that part of the problem was that there wasn't a single, obvious
place where developers could go and get information on how to avoid
known pitfalls.
The information was publicly available, but it was often hard to find,
out-of-date, incomplete, or had other problems.
Most such information didn't particularly discuss Linux at all, even
though it was becoming widely used!
That leads up to the answer: I developed this document
in the hope that future software developers for Linux won't repeat
past mistakes, resulting in an even more secure form of Linux.
I added Unix, since it's often wise to make sure that programs can
port between these systems.
You can see a larger discussion of this at

<para>
A related question that could be asked is ``why did you write your own document
instead of just referring to other documents''?
There are several answers:

<itemizedlist>

the critical information in one organized document
makes it easier to use.

</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
Much of the available information emphasizes portable constructs
(constructs that work on all Unix-like systems), and
failed to discuss Linux at all.
It's often best to avoid Linux-unique abilities for portability's sake,
but sometimes the Linux-unique abilities can really aid security.
Even if non-Linux portability is desired, you may want to support
the Linux-unique abilities when running on Linux.
And, by emphasizing Linux, I can include references to information that
is helpful to someone targeting Linux that is not necessarily true for
others.

There's also a large body of information on vulnerabilities

This paper is a summary of what I believe are the most
useful and important guidelines; my goal is a document that
a good programmer can just read and then be fairly well prepared
to implement a secure program.
No single document can really meet this goal, but
I believe the attempt is worthwhile.
My goal is to strike a balance somewhere between a
``complete list of all possible guidelines''
(that would be unending and unreadable)
and the various ``short'' lists available on-line that are nice and short
but omit a large number of critical issues.
When in doubt, I include the guidance; I believe in that case it's better
to make the information
available to everyone in this ``one stop shop'' document.
The organization presented here is my own (every list has its own, different
structure), and some of the guidelines (especially the Linux-unique
ones, such as those on capabilities and the fsuid value) are also my own.
Reading all of the referenced documents listed above as well
is highly recommended.

The pointer value that means ``does not point anywhere'' is called NULL;
C compilers will convert the integer 0 to the value NULL in most circumstances

C and C++ treat the character '\0' (ASCII 0) specially, and this value

I use the term ``Unix-like'' to mean Unix, Linux, or other systems whose

</epigraph>

<para>
Before discussing guidelines on how to use Linux or Unix security features,
it's useful to know what those features are from a programmer's viewpoint.
This section briefly describes those features that are widely available
on nearly all Unix-like systems.
However, note that there is considerable variation between
different versions of Unix-like systems, and
not all systems have the abilities described here.
This chapter also notes some extensions or features specific to Linux;
Linux distributions tend to be fairly similar to each other from the
point-of-view of programming for security, because they all use essentially
the same kernel and C library (and the GPL-based licenses encourage rapid
dissemination of any innovations).
This chapter doesn't discuss issues such as implementations of
mandatory access control (MAC) which many Unix-like systems do not implement.
If you already know what
those features are, please feel free to skip this section.
</para>

<para>
Many programming guides skim briefly over the security-relevant portions
of Linux or Unix and skip important information.
In particular, they often discuss ``how to use'' something in general terms
but gloss over the security attributes that affect their use.
Conversely, there's a great deal of detailed information in
the manual pages about individual functions, but the manual pages
sometimes obscure key security issues with detailed discussions on how
to use each individual function.
This section tries to bridge that gap; it gives an overview of
the security mechanisms in Linux that are likely to be used
by a programmer, but concentrating specifically on the security
ramifications.
This section has more depth than the typical programming guides, focusing
specifically on security-related matters, and points to references
where you can get more details.
</para>

<para>
First, the basics.
Linux and Unix are
fundamentally divided into two parts: the kernel and ``user space''.
Most programs execute in user space (on top of the kernel).
Linux supports the concept of ``kernel modules'', which is simply the
ability to dynamically load code into the kernel, but note that it
still has this fundamental division.
Some other systems (such as the HURD) are ``microkernel'' based systems; they
have a small kernel with more limited functionality, and a set of ``user''
programs that implement the lower-level functions traditionally implemented
by the kernel.
</para>

<para>
Some Unix-like systems have been extensively modified to support
strong security, in particular to support U.S. Department of Defense
requirements for Mandatory Access Control (level B1 or higher).
This version of this paper doesn't cover these systems or issues;
I hope to expand to that in a future version.
<!-- ???: Mention trusted Unix-like systems, MAC, ACLs, Trusted Solaris -->
</para>

<para>
When users log in, their usernames are mapped to integers marking their
``UID'' (for ``user id'') and the ``GID''s (for ``group id'') that they
are a member of.
UID 0 is a special privileged user (role) traditionally called ``root'';
on most Unix-like systems (including Unix) root
can overrule most security checks and is used to administrate the system.
Processes are the only ``subjects'' in terms of security (that is, only
processes are active objects).
Processes can access various data objects, in particular filesystem
objects (FSOs), System V Interprocess Communication (IPC) objects, and
network ports.
Processes can also set signals.
Other security-relevant topics include quotas and limits, libraries,
auditing, and PAM.
The next few subsections detail this.
</para>

<sect1 id="processes">
<title>Processes</title>

<para>
In Unix-like systems,
user-level activities are implemented by running processes.
Most Unix systems support a ``thread'' as a separate concept;
threads share memory inside a process, and the system scheduler actually
schedules threads.
Linux does this differently (and in my opinion uses a better approach):
there is no essential difference between a thread and a process.
Instead, in Linux, when a process creates another process it can choose
what resources are shared (e.g., memory can be shared).
The Linux kernel then performs optimizations to get thread-level speeds;
see clone(2) for more information.
It's worth noting that the Linux kernel developers tend to use the
word ``task'', not ``thread'' or ``process'', but the external
documentation tends to use the word process
(so I'll use that terminology here).
When programming a multi-threaded application,
it's usually better to use one of the standard
thread libraries that hide these differences.
Not only does this make threading more portable, but some libraries
provide an additional level of indirection, by implementing more than
one application-level thread as a single operating system thread;
this can provide some improved performance on some systems for
some applications.
</para>

<sect2 id="process-attributes">
<title>Process Attributes</title>

<para>
Here are typical attributes associated with each process in a
Unix-like system:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<para>
RUID, RGID - real UID and GID
of the user on whose behalf the process is running
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
EUID, EGID - effective UID and GID
used for privilege checks (except for the filesystem)
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
SUID, SGID - Saved UID and GID;
used to support switching permissions ``on and off'' as discussed below.
Not all Unix-like systems support this.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
supplemental groups - a list of groups (GIDs) in which this
user has membership.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
umask - a set of bits determining the default access control settings
when a new filesystem object is created; see umask(2).
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
scheduling parameters - each process has a scheduling policy, and those
with the default policy SCHED&lowbar;OTHER have the additional parameters
nice, priority, and counter.  See sched&lowbar;setscheduler(2) for more information.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
limits - per-process resource limits (see below).
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
filesystem root - the process' idea of where the root filesystem
begins; see chroot(2).
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</para>

<para>
Here are less-common attributes associated with processes:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<para>
FSUID, FSGID - UID and GID used for filesystem access checks;
this is usually equal to the EUID and EGID respectively.
This is a Linux-unique attribute.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
capabilities - POSIX capability information; there are actually three
sets of capabilities on a process: the effective, inheritable, and permitted
capabilities.  See below for more information on POSIX capabilities.
Linux kernel version 2.2 and greater support this; some other Unix-like
systems do too, but it's not as widespread.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</para>

<para>
In Linux,
if you really need to know exactly what attributes are associated
with each process, the most definitive source is the
Linux source code, in particular
<filename>/usr/include/linux/sched.h</filename>'s definition of task&lowbar;struct.
</para>

<para>
The portable way to create new processes it use the fork(2) call.
BSD introduced a variant called vfork(2) as an optimization technique.
The bottom line with vfork(2) is simple: <emphasis remap="it">don't</emphasis> use it if you
can avoid it.
In vfork(2), unlike fork(2),  the child borrows the parent's memory
and thread of control until a call to execve(2V) or an exit occurs;
the parent process is suspended while the child is using its resources.
The rationale is that in old BSD systems, fork(2) would actually cause
memory to be copied while vfork(2) would not.
Linux never had this problem; because Linux used copy-on-write
semantics internally, Linux only copies pages when they changed
(actually, there are still some tables that have to be copied; in most
circumstances their overhead is not significant).
Nevertheless, since some programs depend on vfork(2),
recently Linux implemented the BSD vfork(2) semantics
(previously it had been an alias for fork(2)).
The problem with vfork(2) is that it's actually fairly tricky for a
process to not interfere with its parent, especially in high-level languages.
The result: programs using vfork(2) can easily fail when code changes
or even when compiler versions change.
Avoid vfork(2) in most cases; its primary use is to support old
programs that needed vfork's semantics.
</para>

<para>
Linux supports the Linux-unique clone(2) call.
This call works like fork(2), but allows specification of which resources
should be shared (e.g., memory, file descriptors, etc.).
Portable programs shouldn't use this call directly; as noted earlier,
they should instead rely on threading libraries that use the call to implement
threads.

<title>POSIX Capabilities</title>

<para>
POSIX capabilities are sets of bits that permit splitting of the privileges
typically held by root into a larger set of more specific privileges.
POSIX capabilities are defined
by a draft IEEE standard; they're not unique to Linux but they're not
universally supported by other Unix-like systems either.
Linux kernel 2.0 did not support POSIX capabilities, while version 2.2
added support for POSIX capabilities to processes.
When Linux documentation (including this one)
says ``requires root privilege'', in nearly all cases it
really means ``requires a capability'' as documented in the capability
documentation.
If you need to know the specific capability required, look it up in the
capability documentation.
</para>

<para>
In Linux,
the eventual intent is to permit capabilities to be attached to files
in the filesystem; as of this writing, however, this is not yet supported.
There is support for transferring capabilities, but this is disabled
by default.
Linux version 2.2.11 added a feature that makes capabilities
more directly useful, called the ``capability bounding set''.
The capability bounding set is a list of capabilities
that are allowed to be held by any process on the system (otherwise,
only the special init process can hold it).
If a capability does not appear in the bounding set, it may not be
exercised by any process, no matter how privileged. 
This feature can be used to, for example, disable kernel module loading.
A sample tool that takes advantage of this is LCAP at
<ulink

<title>Process Creation and Manipulation</title>

<para>
Processes may be created using fork(2), the non-recommended vfork(2),
or the Linux-unique clone(2); all of these system calls duplicate the existing
process, creating two processes out of it.
A process can execute a different program by calling execve(2),
or various front-ends to it (for example, see exec(3), system(3), and popen(3)).
</para>

<para>
<!-- I've known about the scripting race condition since forever, but the
     description here is vaguely derived from perlsec(1) -->
When a program is executed, and its file has its setuid or setgid bit set,
the process' EUID or EGID (respectively) is usually set to the file's value.
This functionality was the source of an old Unix security weakness
when used to support setuid or setgid scripts, due to a race condition.
Between the time the kernel opens the file to see which interpreter to run,
and when the (now-set-id) interpreter turns around and reopens
the file to interpret it, an attacker might change the file
(directly or via symbolic links).
</para>

<para>
Different Unix-like systems handle the security issue for setuid scripts
in different ways.
Some systems, such as Linux, completely ignore the setuid and setgid
bits when executing scripts, which is clearly a safe approach.
Most modern releases of SysVr4 and BSD 4.4 use a different approach to
avoid the kernel race condition.
On these systems, when the kernel passes
the name of the set-id script to open to the interpreter,
rather than using a pathname (which would permit the race condition)
it instead passes the filename /dev/fd/3.  This is a special
file already opened on the script, so that there can be no
race condition for attackers to exploit.
Even on these systems I recommend against using the setuid/setgid
shell scripts language for secure programs, as discussed below.
</para>


<para>
In some cases a process can affect the various UID and GID values; see
setuid(2), seteuid(2), setreuid(2), and the Linux-unique setfsuid(2).
In particular the saved user id (SUID) attribute
is there to permit trusted programs to temporarily switch UIDs.
Unix-like systems supporting the SUID use the following rules:
If the RUID is changed, or the EUID is set to a value not equal to the RUID,
the SUID is set to the new EUID.
Unprivileged users can set their EUID from their SUID,
the RUID to the EUID, and the EUID to the RUID.
</para>

<para>
The Linux-unique
FSUID process attribute is intended to permit programs like the NFS server
to limit themselves to only the filesystem rights of some given UID
without giving that UID permission to send signals to the process.
Whenever the EUID is changed, the FSUID is changed to the new
EUID value; the FSUID value can be set separately using setfsuid(2), a
Linux-unique call.
Note that non-root callers can only set FSUID to the current
RUID, EUID, SEUID, or current FSUID values.
</para>

<sect1 id="files">
<title>Files</title>

<para>
On all Unix-like systems, the primary repository of information is
the file tree, rooted at ``/''.
The file tree is a hierarchical set of directories, each of which
may contain filesystem objects (FSOs).
</para>

<para>
In Linux,
filesystem objects (FSOs) may be ordinary files, directories,
symbolic links, named pipes (also called first-in first-outs or FIFOs),
sockets (see below),
character special (device) files, or block special (device) files
(in Linux, this list is given in the find(1) command).
Other Unix-like systems have an identical or similar list of FSO types.
</para>

<para>
Filesystem objects are collected on filesystems, which can be
mounted and unmounted on directories in the file tree.
A filesystem type (e.g., ext2 and FAT) is a specific set of conventions
for arranging data on the disk to optimize speed, reliability, and so on;
many people use the term ``filesystem'' as a synonym for the filesystem type.
</para>

<sect2 id="fso-attributes">
<title>Filesystem Object Attributes</title>

<para>
Different Unix-like systems support different filesystem types.
Filesystems may have slightly different sets of access control attributes
and access controls can be affected by options selected at mount time.
On Linux, the ext2 filesystems is currently the most popular filesystem,
but Linux supports a vast number of filesystems.
Most Unix-like systems tend to support multiple filesystems too.
</para>

<para>
Most filesystems on Unix-like systems store at least the following:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<para>
owning UID and GID - identifies the ``owner'' of the filesystem
object.  Only the owner or root can change the access control attributes
unless otherwise noted.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
permission bits -
read, write, execute bits for each of user (owner), group, and other.
For ordinary files, read, write, and execute have their typical meanings.
In directories, the ``read'' permission is necessary to display a directory's
contents, while the ``execute'' permission is sometimes called ``search''
permission and is necessary to actually enter the directory to use its contents.
In a directory ``write'' permission on a directory permits
adding, removing, and renaming files in that directory; if you only want
to permit adding, set the sticky bit noted below.
Note that the permission values of symbolic links are never used; it's only
the values of their containing directories and the linked-to file that matter.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
``sticky'' bit - when set on a directory, unlinks (removes) and
renames of files in that directory are limited to
the file owner, the directory owner, or root privileges.
This is a very common Unix extension
and is specified in the
Open Group's Single Unix Specification version 2.
<!-- http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/chmod.html -->
Old versions of Unix called this the ``save program text'' bit and used this
to indicate executable files that should stay in memory.
Systems that did this ensured that only root could set this bit
(otherwise users could have crashed systems by forcing ``everything''
into memory).
In Linux, this bit has no affect on ordinary files and ordinary users
can modify this bit on the files they own:
Linux's virtual memory management makes this old use irrelevant.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
setuid, setgid - when set on an executable file,
executing the file will set the process' effective UID or effective GID
to the value of the file's owning UID or GID (respectively).
All Unix-like systems support this.
In Linux and System V systems,
when setgid is set on a file that does not have any execute privileges,
this indicates a file that is subject to mandatory locking
during access (if the filesystem is mounted to support mandatory locking);
this overload of meaning surprises many and is not universal across Unix-like
systems.
In fact, the Open Group's Single Unix Specification version 2 for chmod(3)
permits systems to ignore
requests to turn on setgid for files that aren't executable if such
a setting has no meaning.
In Linux and Solaris,
when setgid is set on a directory, files created in the directory will
have their GID automatically reset to that of the directory's GID.
The purpose of this approach is to support ``project directories'':
users can save files into such specially-set directories and the group
owner automatically changes.
However, setting the setgid bit on directories is not specified by
standards such as the Single Unix Specification
[Open Group 1997].
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
timestamps - access and modification times are stored for each
filesystem object.  However, the owner is allowed to set these values
arbitrarily (see touch(1)), so be careful about trusting this information.
All Unix-like systems support this.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</para>

<para>
The following are attributes are Linux-unique extensions on the ext2
filesystem, though many other filesystems have similar functionality:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<para>
immutable bit - no changes to the filesystem object are allowed;
only root can set or clear this bit.
This is only supported by ext2 and is not portable across all Unix
systems (or even all Linux filesystems).
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
append-only bit - only appending to the filesystem object are allowed;
only root can set or clear this bit.
This is only supported by ext2 and is not portable across all Unix
systems (or even all Linux filesystems).
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</para>

<para>
Other common extensions include some sort of bit indicating ``cannot
delete this file''.
</para>

<para>
Many of these values can be influenced at mount time, so that, for example,
certain bits can be treated as though they had a certain value (regardless
of their values on the media).
See mount(1) for more information about this.
Some filesystems don't support some of these access control values; again,
see mount(1) for how these filesystems are handled.
In particular, many Unix-like systems support MS-DOS disks, which by
default support very few of these attributes (and there's not standard
way to define these attributes).
In that case, Unix-like systems emulate the standard attributes
(possibly implementing them through special on-disk files), and these
attributes are generally influenced by the mount(1) command.
</para>

<para>
It's important to note that, for adding and removing files, only the
permission bits and owner of the file's <emphasis>directory</emphasis>
really matter unless the Unix-like system supports
more complex schemes (such as POSIX ACLs).
Unless the system has other extensions, and stock Linux 2.2 doesn't,
a file that has no permissions in its permission bits
can still be removed if its containing directory permits it.
Also, if an ancestor directory permits its children to be changed by some
user or group, then any of that directory's descendents can be replaced by
that user or group.
</para>

<para>
The draft IEEE POSIX standard on security defines a technique for
true ACLs that support a list of users and groups with their permissions.
Unfortunately, this is not widely supported nor supported exactly the
same way across Unix-like systems.
Stock Linux 2.2, for example, has neither ACLs nor POSIX capability
values in the filesystem.
</para>

<para>
It's worth noting that in Linux, the Linux ext2
filesystem by default reserves a small amount of space for the root user.
This is a partial defense against denial-of-service attacks; even if a user
fills a disk that is shared with the root user, the root user has a little
space left over (e.g., for critical functions).
The default is 5&percnt; of the filesystem space; see mke2fs(8),
in particular its ``-m'' option.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="fso-initial-values">
<title>Creation Time Initial Values</title>

<para>
At creation time, the following rules apply.
On most Unix systems, when a new filesystem object is created via creat(2)
or open(2), the FSO UID is set to the process' EUID and the FSO's GID is
set to the process' EGID.
Linux works slightly differently due to its FSUID
extensions; the FSO's UID is set to the process' FSUID, and the FSO GID
is set to the process' FSGUID; if the
containing directory's setgid bit is set or the filesystem's
``GRPID'' flag is set, the FSO GID is actually set to the
GID of the containing directory.
Many systems, including Sun Solaris and Linux, also support the
setgid directory extensions.
As noted earlier,
this special case supports ``project'' directories: to make a ``project''
directory, create a special group for the project,
create a directory for the project owned by that group, then make the
directory setgid: files placed there
are automatically owned by the project.
Similarly, if a new subdirectory is created inside a directory with the
setgid bit set (and the filesystem GRPID isn't set), the new subdirectory
will also have its setgid bit set (so that project subdirectories will
``do the right thing''.); in all other cases the setgid is clear for a new file.
This is the rationale for Red Hat Linux's ``user-private group'' scheme,
in which
every user is a member of a ``private'' group with just them as members,
so their defaults can permit the group to read and write any file
(since they're the only member of the group).
Thus, when the file's group membership
is transferred this way, read and write privileges
are transferred too.
<!-- http://www.redhat.com/support/manuals/RHL-6.2-Manual/ref-guide/s1-sysadmin-usr-grps.html -->
FSO basic access control values (read, write, execute) are computed from
(requested values &amp; ~ umask of process).
New files always start with a clear sticky bit and clear setuid bit.
</para>

<title>Changing Access Control Attributes</title>

You can set most of these values with chmod(2), fchmod(2), or chmod(1)
but see also chown(1), and chgrp(1).
In Linux, some the Linux-unique attributes are manipulated using chattr(1).
</para>

<para>
Note that in Linux, only root can change the owner of a given file.
Some Unix-like systems allow ordinary users to transfer ownership of their
files to another, but this causes complications and is forbidden by Linux.
For example, if you're trying to limit disk usage,
allowing such operations would allow users to claim that large files
actually belonged to some other ``victim''.

The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) tries to

Many Unix-like systems, including

Indeed System V IPC is required by the
Open Group's Single UNIX Specification, Version 2
[Open Group 1997].
<!-- ???: how about BSD variants? -->
System V IPC objects can be one of three kinds:
System V message queues, semaphore sets, and shared memory segments.

<sect1 id="sockets">
<title>Sockets and Network Connections</title>

<para>
<!-- Sockets are supported by System V according to Linux's socket(2) -->
Sockets are used for communication, particularly over a network.
Sockets were originally developed by the
BSD branch of Unix systems, but they are generally portable to other
Unix-like systems: Linux and System V variants support sockets as well, and
socket support is required by the Open Group's
Single Unix Specification [Open Group 1997].
System V systems traditionally used a different (incompatible) network
communication interface, but it's worth noting that systems like Solaris
include support for sockets.
Socket(2) creates an endpoint for communication and returns a descriptor,
in a manner similar to open(2) for files.
The parameters for socket specify the protocol family and type,
such as the Internet domain (TCP/IP version 4), Novell's IPX,
or the ``Unix domain''.
A server then typically calls bind(2), listen(2), and accept(2) or select(2).
A client typically calls bind(2) (though that may be omitted) and
connect(2).
See these routine's respective man pages for more information.
It can be difficult to understand how to use sockets from their man pages;
you might want to consult other papers such as
Hall "Beej" [1999]
to learn how these calls are used together.
</para>

<para>
The ``Unix domain sockets'' don't actually represent a network protocol; they
can only connect to sockets on the same machine.
(at the time of this writing for the standard Linux kernel).
When used as a stream, they are fairly similar to named pipes, but with
significant advantages.
In particular, Unix domain socket is connection-oriented; each new connection to
the socket results in a new communication channel, a very different situation
than with named pipes.
Because of this property, Unix domain sockets are often used instead of
named pipes to implement IPC for many important services.
Just like you can have unnamed pipes, you can have unnamed Unix domain sockets
using socketpair(2); unnamed Unix domain sockets
are useful for IPC in a way similar to unnamed pipes.
</para>

<para>
There are several interesting security implications of Unix domain sockets.
First, although Unix domain sockets can appear in the filesystem and can have
stat(2) applied to them, you can't use open(2) to open them (you have
to use the socket(2) and friends interface).
Second, Unix domain sockets can be used to pass
file descriptors between processes (not just the file's contents).
This odd capability, not available in any other IPC mechanism, has been used
to hack all sorts of schemes (the descriptors can basically
be used as a limited version of the
``capability'' in the computer science sense of the term).
File descriptors are sent using sendmsg(2), where the msg (message)'s
field msg&lowbar;control points to an array of control message headers
(field msg&lowbar;controllen must specify the number of bytes contained in the array).
Each control message is a struct cmsghdr followed by data, and for this purpose
you want the cmsg&lowbar;type set to SCM&lowbar;RIGHTS.
A file descriptor is retrieved through recvmsg(2) and then tracked down in
the analogous way.
Frankly, this feature is quite baroque, but it's worth knowing about.
</para>

<para>
Linux 2.2 supports an addition feature in Unix domain sockets: you can
acquire the peer's ``credentials'' (the pid, uid, and gid).
Here's some sample code:
<programlisting width="61">
<![CDATA[
 /* fd= file descriptor of Unix domain socket connected
    to the client you wish to identify */

 struct ucred cr;
 int cl=sizeof(cr);

 if (getsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_PEERCRED, &cr, &cl)==0) {
   printf("Peer's pid=%d, uid=%d, gid=%d\n",
           cr.pid, cr.uid, cr.gid);
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
Standard Unix convention is that binding to
TCP and UDP local port numbers less than 1024 requires
root privilege, while any process can bind to an unbound port number
of 1024 or greater.
Linux follows this convention,
more specifically, Linux requires a process to have the
capability CAP&lowbar;NET&lowbar;BIND&lowbar;SERVICE to bind to a port number less than 1024;
this capability is normally only held by processes with an euid of 0.
The adventurous can check this in Linux by examining its Linux's source;
in Linux 2.2.12, it's file <filename>/usr/src/linux/net/ipv4/af&lowbar;inet.c</filename>,
function inet&lowbar;bind().
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="signals">
<title>Signals</title>

<para>
Signals are a simple form of ``interruption'' in the Unix-like OS world,
and are an ancient part of Unix.
A process can set a ``signal'' on another process (say using
kill(1) or kill(2)), and that other process would receive and
handle the signal asynchronously.
For a process to have permission to send a signal to some other process,
the sending process must either have root privileges, or
the real or effective user ID of the sending process
must equal the real or saved set-user-ID of the receiving process.
</para>

<para>
Although signals are an ancient part of Unix, they've had different
semantics in different implementations.
Basically, they involve questions such as ``what happens when a signal
occurs while handling another signal''?
The older Linux libc 5 used a different set of semantics for some signal
operations than the newer GNU libc libraries.
For more information, see the glibc FAQ (on some systems a local
copy is available at <filename>/usr/doc/glibc-*/FAQ</filename>).
</para>

<para>
For new programs, just use the POSIX signal system
(which in turn was based on BSD work); this set is widely supported
and doesn't have the problems that some of the older signal systems did.
The POSIX signal system is based on using the sigset&lowbar;t datatype, which can
be manipulated through a set of operations: sigemptyset(),
sigfillset(), sigaddset(), sigdelset(), and sigismember().
You can read about these in sigsetops(3).
Then use sigaction(2), sigaction(2), sigprocmask(2),
sigpending(2), and sigsuspend(2) to set up an manipulate signal handling
(see their man pages for more information).
</para>

<para>
In general, make any signal handlers very short and simple, and
look carefully for race conditions.
Signals, since they are by nature asynchronous,
can easily cause race conditions.
</para>

<para>
A common convention exists for servers: if you receive SIGHUP, you should
close any log files, reopen and reread configuration files, and then
re-open the log files.
This supports reconfiguration without halting the server and
log rotation without data loss.
If you are writing a server where this convention makes sense,
please support it.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="quotas">
<title>Quotas and Limits</title>

<para>
Many Unix-like systems have
mechanisms to support filesystem quotas and process resource limits.
This certainly includes Linux.
These mechanisms are particularly useful for preventing denial of service
attacks; by limiting the resources available to each user, you can make
it hard for a single user to use up all the system resources.
Be careful with terminology here, because both filesystem quotas
and process resource limits have ``hard'' and
``soft'' limits but the terms mean slightly different things.
</para>

<para>
You can define storage (filesystem) quota limits on each mountpoint
for the number of blocks of storage and/or the number of unique files
(inodes) that can be used, and you can set such limits for a given user
or a given group.
A ``hard'' quota limit is a never-to-exceed limit, while a
``soft'' quota can be temporarily exceeded.
See quota(1), quotactl(2), and quotaon(8).
</para>

<para>
The rlimit mechanism supports a large number of process quotas, such as
file size, number of child processes, number of open files, and so on.
There is a ``soft'' limit (also called the current limit) and a
``hard limit'' (also called the upper limit).
The soft limit cannot be exceeded at any time, but through calls it can
be raised up to the value of the hard limit.
See getrlimit(), setrlimit(), and getrusage().
Note that there are several ways to set these limits, including the
PAM module pam&lowbar;limits.
</para>

<sect1 id="dlls">
<title>Dynamically Linked Libraries</title>

<para>
Practically all programs depend on libraries to execute.
In most modern Unix-like systems, including Linux,
programs are by default compiled to use <emphasis remap="it">dynamically linked libraries</emphasis>
(DLLs).
That way, you can update a library and all the programs using that library
will use the new (hopefully improved) version if they can.
</para>

<para>
Dynamically linked libraries are typically placed in one a few special
directories. The usual directories include
<filename>/lib</filename>, <filename>/usr/lib</filename>, <filename>/lib/security</filename>
for PAM modules, 
<filename>/usr/X11R6/lib</filename> for X-windows, and <filename>/usr/local/lib</filename>.
</para>

<para>
There are special conventions for naming libraries and having symbolic
links for them, with the result that you can update libraries and still
support programs that want to use old, non-backward-compatible versions
of those libraries.
There are also ways to override specific libraries or even just
specific functions in a library when executing a particular program.
This is a real advantage of Unix-like systems over
Windows-like systems; I believe Unix-like systems have a much better system
for handling library updates, one reason that Unix and Linux systems are reputed
to be more stable than Windows-based systems.
</para>

On GNU glibc-based systems, including all Linux systems,
the list of directories automatically searched during program start-up is
stored in the file /etc/ld.so.conf.
Many Red Hat-derived distributions don't normally
include <filename>/usr/local/lib</filename>
in the file <filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename>.
I consider this a bug, and adding <filename>/usr/local/lib</filename> to
<filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename>
is a common ``fix'' required to run many programs on Red Hat-derived systems.
If you want to just override a few functions in a library, but keep the
rest of the library, you can enter the names of overriding libraries
(.o files) in <filename>/etc/ld.so.preload</filename>;
these ``preloading'' libraries will take precedence over the standard set.
This preloading file is typically used for emergency patches;
a distribution usually won't include such a file when delivered.
Searching all of these directories at program start-up would be too
time-consuming, so a caching arrangement is actually used.
The program ldconfig(8) by default reads in the file /etc/ld.so.conf,
sets up the appropriate symbolic links in the dynamic link directories
(so they'll follow the standard conventions),
and then writes a cache to /etc/ld.so.cache that's then used by other
programs.
So, ldconfig has to be run whenever a DLL is added, when a DLL is removed,
or when the set of DLL directories changes; running ldconfig is often
one of the steps performed by package managers
when installing a library.
On start-up, then, a program uses the dynamic loader to
read the file /etc/ld.so.cache and then load the libraries it needs.
</para>

<para>
Various environment variables can control this process, and in fact
there are environment variables that permit you to
override this process (so, for example, you can temporarily
substitute a different library for this particular execution).
In Linux,
the environment variable
LD&lowbar;LIBRARY&lowbar;PATH is a colon-separated set of directories where libraries
should be searched for first, before the standard set of directories;
this is useful when debugging a new library or using a nonstandard
library for special purposes.
The variable LD&lowbar;PRELOAD lists object files with functions that override
the standard set, just as /etc/ld.so.preload does.
</para>

<para>
Permitting user control over dynamically linked libraries
would be disastrous for setuid/setgid programs if special measures
weren't taken.
Therefore, in the GNU glibc implementation, if the program is setuid or setgid
these variables (and other similar variables) are ignored or greatly
limited in what they can do.
The GNU glibc library determines if a program is setuid or setgid
by checking the program's credentials;
if the uid and euid differ, or the gid and the egid differ, the
library presumes the program is setuid/setgid (or descended from one)
and therefore greatly limits its abilities to control linking.
If you load the GNU glibc libraries, you can see this; see especially
the files elf/rtld.c and sysdeps/generic/dl-sysdep.c.
This means that if you cause the uid and gid to equal the euid and egid,
and then call a program, these variables will have full effect.
Other Unix-like systems handle the situation differently but for the
same reason: a setuid/setgid program should not be unduly affected
by the environment variables set.

Different Unix-like systems handle auditing differently.
In Linux, the most common ``audit'' mechanism is syslogd(8), usually working
in conjuction with klogd(8).
You might also want to look at wtmp(5), utmp(5), lastlog(8), and acct(2).
Some server programs (such as the Apache web server)
also have their own audit trail mechanisms.
According to the FHS, audit logs should be stored in /var/log or its

<para>
Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men,
from men whose words are perverse...
</para>
</epigraph>

<para>
Some inputs are from untrustable users, so those inputs must be validated
(filtered) before being used.
You should determine what is legal and reject anything that does
not match that definition.
Do not do the reverse (identify what is illegal and reject those cases),
because you are likely to forget to handle an important case.
Limit the maximum character length (and minimum length if appropriate),
and be sure to not lose control when such lengths are exceeded
(see <xref linkend="buffer-overflow"> for more about this kind of
problem, called a buffer overflow).
</para>

<para>
For strings, identify the legal characters or legal patterns
(e.g., as a regular expression) and reject anything not matching that form.
There are special problems when strings contain control characters
(especially linefeed or NIL) or shell metacharacters; it is often
best to ``escape'' such metacharacters immediately when the input is received so
that such characters are not accidentally sent.
CERT goes further and recommends escaping all characters
that aren't in a list of characters not needing escaping [CERT 1998, CMU 1998].
See <xref linkend="limit-call-outs">
for more information on limiting call-outs.
</para>

<para>
Limit all numbers to the minimum (often zero) and maximum allowed values.
Filenames should be checked; usually you will want to not include ``..''
(higher directory) as a legal value.
In filenames it's best to prohibit any change in directory, e.g., by not
including ``/'' in the set of legal characters.
A full email address checker is actually quite complicated, because there
are legacy formats that greatly complicate validation if you need
to support all of them; see mailaddr(7) and IETF RFC 822 [RFC 822]
for more information if such checking is necessary.
</para>

<para>
The legal character patterns must not include characters
or character sequences that have special meaning to the program internals
or the eventual output unless you account for them.
In particular, if you store data (internally or externally) in delimited
strings, make sure that the delimeters are not permitted data values.
Here are two common cases:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
A character sequence may have special meaning to the program's internal
storage format.
A number of programs
store data in comma (,) or colon (:) delimited text files;
inserting such values
in the input can be problem unless the program accounts for it.
Other characters often causing these problems include single and double quotes
(used for surrounding strings)
and the less-than sign
(used in SGML, XML, and HTML to indicate a tag's beginning).
Most data formats have an escape sequence to handle these cases; use it,
or filter such data on input.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
A character sequence may have special meaning if sent back out to the user.
Another common case is permitting HTML tags in data input that will later
be posted to other readers (e.g., in a guestbook or ``reader comment'' area).
These tags can be used by malicious users to attack other users by inserting
Java references (including references to hostile applets), DHTML tags,
early document endings (via &lt;/HTML&gt;), absurd font size requests,
and so on,
causing anything from unreadable pages to destructive attacks.
It's safest to strip or escape all HTML tags, but at least identify a list
of ``safe'' HTML commands and only permit those commands.
Common safe HTML tags that might be useful for guestbook or
other applications supporting short comments include
&lt;P&gt; (paragraph),
&lt;B&gt; (bold),
&lt;I&gt; (italics),
&lt;EM&gt; (emphasis),
&lt;STRONG&gt; (strong emphasis),
&lt;PRE&gt; (preformatted text),
&lt;BR&gt; (forced line break),
and
&lt;A HREF="safe URI"&gt; (hypertext link),
as well as all their ending tags.
You might even consider supporting the list-oriented tags, such as
&lt;OL&gt; (ordered list),
&lt;UL&gt; (unordered list),
and &lt;LI&gt; (list item).
It's tricky to define ``safe URI''; I'd suggest a pattern like
``(http|ftp)://[-A-Za-z0-9._]+''
(this allows ``..'', which is often fine in this application, but
note that it intentionally prevents most query formats and other
schemes like ``mailto'').
There are more HTML tags, but after a certain point you're really permitting
full publishing (in which case you need to trust them or perform more
serious checking than will be described here).
You really should check if the HTML commands are properly nested
(though supporting an implied &lt;/P&gt; where not provided before a
&lt;P&gt; would be fine), and if you support list tags further checking
is warranted.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
These tests should usually be centralized in one place so that the
validity tests can be easily examined for correctness later.
</para>

<para>
Make sure that your validity test is actually correct; this is particularly
a problem when checking input that will be used by another program
(such as a filename, email address, or URL).
Often these tests are have subtle errors, producing the so-called
``deputy problem'' (where the checking program
makes different assumptions than the program that actually uses the data).
</para>

<para>
While parsing user input, it's a good idea to temporarily drop all privileges,
or even create separate processes (with the parser having permanently dropped
privileges, and the other process performing security checks against the
parser requests).
This is especially true if the parsing task is complex (e.g., if you use
a lex-like or yacc-like tool), or if the programming language
doesn't protect against buffer overflows (e.g., C and C++).
See
<xref linkend="minimize-privileges">
for more information on minimizing privileges.
</para>

<para>
The following subsections discuss different kinds of inputs to a program;
note that input includes process state such as environment variables,
umask values, and so on.
Not all inputs are under the control of an untrusted user, so you need
only worry about those inputs that are.
</para>

<sect1 id="command-line">
<title>Command line</title>

<para>
Many programs use the command line as an input interface, accepting
input by being passed arguments.
A setuid/setgid program has a command line interface provided to it by
an untrusted user, so it must defend itself.
Users have great control over the command line (through calls such
as the execve(3) call).
Therefore, setuid/setgid programs must validate the command line inputs and
must not trust the name of the program reported by command line argument zero
(the user can set it to any value including NULL).
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="environment-variables">
<title>Environment Variables</title>

<para>
By default, environment variables are inherited from a process' parent.
However, when a program executes another program, the calling program
can set the environment variables to arbitrary values.
This is dangerous to setuid/setgid programs, because their invoker can
completely control the environment variables they're given.
Since they are usually inherited, this also applies transitively; a
secure program might call some other program and, without special measures,
would pass potentially dangerous environment variables values on to the
program it calls.
</para>

<sect2 id="env-vars-dangerous">
<title>Some Environment Variables are Dangerous</title>

<para>
Some environment variables are dangerous because
many libraries and programs are controlled by environment
variables in ways that are obscure, subtle, or undocumented.
For example, the IFS variable is used by the <emphasis remap="it">sh</emphasis> and <emphasis remap="it">bash</emphasis>
shell to determine which characters separate command line arguments.
Since the shell is invoked by several low-level calls
(like system(3) and popen(3) in C, or the back-tick operator in Perl),
setting IFS to unusual values can subvert apparently-safe calls.
This behavior is documented in bash and sh, but it's obscure;
many long-time users only know about IFS because of its use in breaking
security, not because it's actually used very often for its intended purpose.
What is worse is that not all environment variables are documented, and
even if they are, those other programs may change and add dangerous
environment variables.
Thus, the only real solution (described below) is to select the ones you
need and throw away the rest.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="env-storage-dangerous">
<title>Environment Variable Storage Format is Dangerous</title>

<para>
Normally, programs should use the standard access routines to access
environment variables.
For example, in C, you should get values
using getenv(3), set them using the
POSIX standard routine putenv(3) or the BSD extension setenv(3)
and eliminate environment variables using unsetenv(3).
I should note here that setenv(3) is implemented in Linux, too.
However, crackers need not be so nice; crackers can directly control the
environment variable data area passed to a program using execve(2).
This permits some nasty attacks, which can only be understood by
understanding how environment variables really work.
In Linux, you can see environ(5) for a summary how about environment variables
really work.
In short, environment variables are internally stored as a pointer to
an array of pointers to characters; this array is stored in order and
terminated by a NULL pointer (so you'll know when the array ends).
The pointers to characters, in turn, each
point to a NIL-terminated string value of the form ``NAME=value''.
This has several implications, for example, environment variable names
can't include the equal sign, and neither the name nor value can have
embedded NIL characters.
However, a more dangerous implication of this format is that it allows
multiple entries with the same variable name, but with different values
(e.g., more than one value for SHELL).
While typical command shells prohibit doing this,
a locally-executing cracker can create such a situation using execve(2).
</para>

<para>
The problem with this storage format (and the way it's set)
is that a program might check one of these values
(to see if it's valid) but actually use a different one.
In Linux,
the GNU glibc libraries try to shield programs from this;
glibc 2.1's implementation of getenv will always get the first matching
entry, setenv and putenv will always set the first matching entry, and
unsetenv will actually unset <emphasis remap="it">all</emphasis> of the matching entries
(congratulations to the GNU glibc implementors for implementing
unsetenv this way!).
However, some programs go directly to the environ variable and iterate
across all environment variables; in this case,
they might use the last matching entry instead of the first one.
As a result, if checks were made against the first matching entry instead,
but the actual value used is the last matching entry,
a cracker can use this fact to circumvent the protection routines.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="env-var-solution">
<title>The Solution - Extract and Erase</title>

<para>
For secure setuid/setgid programs, the short list of environment variables
needed as input (if any) should be carefully extracted.
Then the entire environment should be erased,
followed by resetting a small set of necessary environment
variables to safe values.
There really isn't a better way if you make any calls to subordinate
programs; there's no practical
method of listing ``all the dangerous values''.
Even if you reviewed the source code of every program you call
directly or indirectly,
someone may add new undocumented environment variables after you
write your code, and one of them may be exploitable.
</para>

<para>
The simple way to erase the environment is by setting the global variable
<emphasis remap="it">environ</emphasis>
to NULL.
The global variable environ is defined in &lt;unistd.h&gt;; C/C++ users will
want to &num;include this header file.
You will need to manipulate this value before spawning threads, but that's
rarely a problem, since you want to do these manipulations very early in
the program's execution.
Another way is to use the undocumented clearenv() function.
clearenv() has an odd history; it was supposed to be defined in POSIX.1, but
somehow never made it into that standard.
However, clearenv() is defined in POSIX.9
(the Fortran 77 bindings to POSIX), so there is a quasi-official status for it.
clearenv() is defined in &lt;stdlib.h&gt;, but before using &num;include
to include it you must make sure that &lowbar;&lowbar;USE&lowbar;MISC is &num;defined.
</para>

<para>
One value you'll almost certainly re-add is PATH,
the list of directories to search for programs; PATH should
<emphasis remap="it">not</emphasis> include the current directory and usually be something simple like
``/bin:/usr/bin''.
Typically you'll also set
IFS (to its default of `` \t\n'') and TZ (timezone).
Linux won't die if you don't supply either IFS or TZ,
but some System V based systems have problems if you don't supply a TZ value,
and it's rumored that some shells need the IFS value set.
In Linux, see environ(5) for a list of common environment variables that you
<emphasis remap="it">might</emphasis> want to set.
</para>

<para>
If you really need user-supplied values, check the values first
(to ensure that the values match a pattern for legal values and that they
are within some reasonable maximum length).
Ideally there would be some standard trusted file in /etc with the
information for ``standard safe environment variable values'',
but at this time there's no standard file defined for this purpose.
For something similar, you might want to examine the PAM module pam&lowbar;env
on those systems which have that module.
</para>

<para>
If you're programming a setuid/setgid program in a language
that doesn't allow you to reset the environment directly,
one approach is to create a ``wrapper'' program.
The wrapper sets the environment program to safe values, and then
calls the other program.
Beware: make sure the wrapper will actually invoke the intended program;
if it's an interpreted program, make sure there's no race condition possible
that would allow the interpreter to load a different program than the one
that was granted the special setuid/setgid privileges.
</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="file-descriptors">
<title>File Descriptors</title>

<para>
A program is passed a set of ``open file descriptors'', that is,
pre-opened files.
A setuid/setgid program must deal with the fact that the user gets to
select what files are open and to what (within their permission limits).
A setuid/setgid program must not assume that opening a new file will always
open into a fixed file descriptor id.
It must also not assume that standard input (stdin),
standard output (stdout), and standard error (stderr)
refer to a terminal or are even open.
</para>

<para>
The rationale behind this is easy; since an attacker can open or
close a file descriptor before starting the program,
the attacker could create an unexpected situation.
If the attacker closes the standard output, when the program opens
the next file it will be opened as though it were standard output,
and then it will send all standard output to that file as well.
Some C libraries will automatically open stdin, stdout, and stderr
if they aren't already open (to /dev/null), but this isn't true on
all Unix-like systems.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="file-contents">
<title>File Contents</title>

<para>
If a program takes directions from a file, it must not trust that file
specially unless only a trusted user can control its contents.
Usually this means that an untrusted user must not be able to modify the file,
its directory, or any of its ancestor directories.
Otherwise, the file must be treated as suspect.
</para>

<para>
If the directions in the file are supposed to be from an untrusted user,
then make sure that the inputs from the file are protected as describe
throughout this document.
In particular, check that values match the set of legal values, and that
buffers are not overflowed.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="web-apps">
<title>Web-Based Applications (Especially CGI Scripts)</title>

<para>
Web-based applications (such as CGI scripts) run on some trusted
server and must get their
input data somehow through the web.
Since the input data generally come from untrusted users,
this input data must be validated.
For example, CGI scripts
are passed this information
through a standard set of environment variables and through standard input.
The rest of this text will specifically discuss CGI, because it's
the most common technique for implementing dynamic web content, but
the general issues are the same for most other dynamic web content techniques.
</para>

<para>
One additional complication is that many CGI inputs are provided in
so-called ``URL-encoded'' format, that is, some values are written in the
format &percnt;HH where HH is the hexadecimal code for that byte.
You or your CGI library must handle these inputs correctly by
URL-decoding the input and then checking
if the resulting byte value is acceptable.
You must correctly handle all values, including problematic
values such as &percnt;00 (NIL) and &percnt;0A (newline).
Don't decode inputs more than once, or input such as ``&percnt;2500''
will be mishandled (the &percnt;25 would be translated to ``&percnt;'', and the resulting
``&percnt;00'' would be erroneously translated to the NIL character).
</para>

<para>
CGI scripts are commonly attacked by including special characters in their
inputs; see the comments above.
</para>

<para>
Some HTML forms include client-side checking to prevent some illegal values.
This checking can be helpful for the user but is useless for security, because
attackers can send such ``illegal'' values directly to the web server.
In general, servers must perform all their own input checking, because
they cannot trust clients to do this securely (clients are generally
not ``trustworthy channels'' for such information).
See <xref linkend="trustworthy-channels">
for more information on trustworthy channels.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="other-inputs">
<title>Other Inputs</title>

<para>
Programs must ensure that all inputs are controlled; this is particularly
difficult for setuid/setgid programs because they have so many such inputs.
Other inputs programs must consider include the current directory,
signals, memory maps (mmaps), System V IPC, and the umask (which determines
the default permissions of newly-created files).
Consider explicitly changing directories (using chdir(2)) to an appropriately
fully named directory at program startup.

<sect1 id="locale">
<title>Human Language (Locale) Selection</title>

<para>
As more people have computers and the Internet available to them, there
has been increasing pressure for programs
to support multiple human languages and cultures.
This combination of language and other cultural factors is usually called
a ``locale''.
The process of modifying a program so it can support multiple locales
is called ``internationalization'' (i18n), and the process of providing
the information for a particular locale to a program is called
``localization'' (l10n).
</para>

<para>
Overall, internationalization
is a good thing, but this process provides another opportunity
for a security exploit.
Since a potentially untrusted user provides information on the desired
locale, locale selection becomes another input that,
if not properly protected, can be exploited.
</para>

<sect2 id="how-locales-selected">
<title>How Locales are Selected</title>

<para>
In locally-run programs (including setuid/setgid programs),
locale information is provided by an environment
variable.
Thus, like all other environment variables, these values
must be extracted and checked against valid patterns before use.
</para>

<para>
For web applications, this information can be obtained from the web
browser (via the Accept-Language request header).
However, since not all web browsers properly pass this information
(and not all users configure their browsers properly),
this is used less often than you might think.
Often, the language requested in a web browser
is simply passed in as a form value.
Again, these values must be checked for validity before use, as with
any other form value.
</para>

<para>
In either case, locale information is
really just a special case of input discussed in the previous sections.
However, because this input is so rarely considered,
I'm discussing it separately.
In particular,
when combined with format strings (discussed later), user-controlled
strings can permit attackers to force other programs to run
arbitrary instructions,
corrupt data, and do other unfortunate actions.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="locale-support-mechanisms">
<title>Locale Support Mechanisms</title>

<para>
There are two major library interfaces for supporting locale-selected
messages on Unix-like systems,
one called ``catgets'' and the other called ``gettext''.
In the catgets approach, every string is assigned a unique number, which
is used as an index into a table of messages.
In contrast,
in the gettext approach, a string (usually in English) is used to
look up a table that translates the original string.
catgets(3) is an accepted standard
(via the X/Open Portability Guide, Volume 3 and
Single Unix Specification),
<!-- http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/catopen.html -->
so it's possible your program uses it.
The ``gettext'' interface is not an official standard,
(though it was originally a UniForum proposal), but I believe it's the
more widely used interface
(it's used by Sun and essentially all GNU programs).
</para>

<para>
In theory, catgets should be slightly faster, but this is at best
marginal on today's machines, and the bookkeeping effort to keep
unique identifiers valid in catgets() makes the gettext() interface
much easier to use.
I'd suggest using gettext(), just because it's easier to use.
However, don't take my word for it; see GNU's documentation on gettext
(info:gettext#catgets) for a longer and more descriptive comparison.
</para>

<para>
The catgets(3) call (and its associated catopen(3) call)
in particular is vulnerable
to security problems, because the environment variable NLSPATH can be
used to control the filenames used to acquire internationalized messages.
The GNU C library ignores NLSPATH for setuid/setgid programs, which helps,
but that doesn't protect programs running on other implementations, nor
other programs (like CGI scripts) which don't ``appear'' to
require such protection.
</para>

<para>
The widely-used ``gettext'' interface is at least not
vulnerable to a malicious NLSPATH setting to my knowledge.
However, it appears likely to me that malicious settings of
LC_ALL or LC_MESSAGES could cause problems.
Also, if you use gettext's bindtextdomain() routine in its file cat-compat.c,
that does depend on NLSPATH.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="locale-legal-values">
<title>Legal Values</title>

<para>
For the moment, if you must permit untrusted users to set information on
their desired locales, make sure the provided internationalization information
meets a narrow filter that only permits legitimate locale names.
For user programs (especially setuid/setgid programs), these values
will come in via NLSPATH, LANGUAGE, LANG, the old LINGUAS, LC_ALL, and
the other LC_* values (especially LC_MESSAGES, but also including
LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE, LC_MONETARY, LC_NUMERIC, and LC_TIME).
For web applications, this user-requested set of language information
would be done via the Accept-Language request header or a form value
(the application should indicate the actual language setting of the
data being returned via the Content-Language heading).
You can check this value as part of your environment variable filtering if
your users can set your environment variables (i.e., setuid/setgid
programs) or as part of your input filtering (e.g., for CGI scripts).
The GNU C library "glibc" doesn't accept some values of LANG for
setuid/setgid programs (in particular anything with "/"),
but errors have been found in that filtering
(e.g., Red Hat released an update to fix this error in glibc
on September 1, 2000).
This kind of filtering isn't required by any standard, so you're
safer doing this filtering yourself.
I have not found any guidance on filtering language settings,
so here are my suggestions based on my own research into the issue.
</para>

<para>
First, a few words about the legal values of these settings.
Language settings are generally set using the standard tags defined
in IETF RFC 1766 (which uses two-letter country codes as its basic tag,
followed by an optional subtag separated by a dash; I've found that
environment variable settings use the underscore instead).
However, some find this insufficiently flexible, so three-letter country
codes may soon be used as well.
Also, there are two major not-quite compatible extended formats, the
X/Open Format and the CEN Format (European Community Standard);
you'd like to permit both.
Typical values include
``C'' (the C locale), ``EN'' (English''),
and ``FR_fr'' (French using the territory of France's conventions).
Also, so many people use nonstandard names that programs have had to develop
``alias'' systems to cope with them
(for GNU gettext, see /usr/share/locale/locale.aliases, and for X11, see
/usr/lib/X11/locale/locale.aliases); they should usually be
permitted as well.
Libraries like gettext() have to accept all these variants and find an
appropriate value, where possible.
One source of further information is FSF [1999].
However, a filter should not permit characters that aren't needed,
in particular ``/'' (which might permit escaping out of the trusted
directories) and ``..'' (which might permit going up one directory).
Other dangerous characters in NLSPATH
include ``%'' (which indicates substitution) and ``:''
(which is the directory separator); the documentation I have for other
machines suggests that some implementations may use them for other values,
so it's safest to prohibit them.
<!-- The Sun man page for "man locale" is disturbingly ambiguous on whether
     or not these characters affect values other than NLSPATH -->
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="locale-bottom-line">
<title>Bottom Line</title>

<para>
In short, I suggest

I haven't found any legitimate locale which doesn't match this pattern,
but this pattern does appear to protect against locale attacks.
Of course, there's no guarantee that there are messages available
in the requested locale,

messages (usually in English), which at least is not a security problem.

<title>Character Encoding</title>

<para>
For many years Americans have been using the ASCII encoding of characters,
permitting easy exchange of English texts.
Unfortunately, ASCII is completely inadequate in handling the character
sets of most other languages.
For many years different countries have adopted different techniques for
exchanging text in different languages.
More recently, ISO has developed ISO 10646, a single 31-bit encoding for
all of the world's characters termed the
Universal Character Set (UCS).
Characters fitting into 16 bits (the first 65536 values of the UCS)
are termed the ``Basic Multilingual Plane''
(BMP), and the BMP is intended to cover nearly all spoken languages.
The Unicode forum develops the Unicode standard, which concentrates on
the 16-bit set and adds some additional conventions to aid interoperability.
</para>

<para>
However, most software is not designed to handle 16 bit or 32 bit characters,
so a special format called ``UTF-8'' was developed to encode these
potentially international
characters in a format more easily handled by existing programs and libraries.
UTF-8 is defined, among other places, in IETF RFC 2279, so it's a
well-defined standard that can be freely read and used.
UTF-8 is a variable-width encoding; characters numbered 0 to 0x7f (127)
encode to themselves as a single byte,
while characters with larger values are encoded into 2 to 6 bytes of
information (depending on their value).
The encoding has been specially designed to have the following
nice properties (this information is from the RFC and Linux utf-8 man page):

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
       The classical US ASCII characters (0 to 0x7f) encode as themselves,
       so files  and strings  which  contain only 7-bit ASCII characters
       have the same encoding under both ASCII and UTF-8.
       This is fabulous for backwards compatibility with the many existing
       U.S. programs and data files.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
       All UCS characters beyond 0x7f are  encoded  as  a  multibyte
       sequence  consisting  only of bytes in the range 0x80 to 0xfd.
       This means that no ASCII byte can appear  as  part  of  another
       character.  Many other encodings permit characters such as an
       embedded NIL, causing programs to fail.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
       It's easy to convert between UTF-8 and a 2-byte or 4-byte
       fixed-width representations of characters (these are called
       UCS-2 and UCS-4 respectively).
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
       The lexicographic sorting order of UCS-4 strings is preserved,
       and the Boyer-Moore fast search algorithm can be used directly
       with UTF-8 data.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
       All  possible 2^31 UCS codes can be encoded using UTF-8.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
       The  first byte of a multibyte sequence which represents
       a single non-ASCII UCS character is always in the  range
       0xc0  to  0xfd  and  indicates  how  long this multibyte
       sequence is. All further bytes in a  multibyte  sequence
       are  in  the range 0x80 to 0xbf. This allows easy resynchronization;
       if a byte is missing, it's easy to skip forward to the ``next''
       character, and it's always easy to skip forward and back to the
       ``next'' or ``preceding'' character.
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>


<para>
In short, the UTF-8 transformation format is becoming a dominant method
for exchanging international text information because it can support all of the
world's languages, yet it is backward compatible with U.S. ASCII files
as well as having other nice properties.
For many purposes I recommend its use, particularly when storing data
in a ``text'' file.
</para>

<para>
The reason to mention UTF-8 is that
some byte sequences are not legal UTF-8, and
this might be an exploitable security hole.  The RFC notes the following:

<blockquote>
<para>
Implementors of UTF-8 need to consider the security aspects of how
they handle illegal UTF-8 sequences.  It is conceivable that in some
circumstances an attacker would be able to exploit an incautious
UTF-8 parser by sending it an octet sequence that is not permitted by
the UTF-8 syntax.
</para>

<para>
A particularly subtle form of this attack could be carried out
against a parser which performs security-critical validity checks
against the UTF-8 encoded form of its input, but interprets certain
illegal octet sequences as characters.  For example, a parser might
prohibit the NUL character when encoded as the single-octet sequence
00, but allow the illegal two-octet sequence C0 80 and interpret it
as a NUL character.  Another example might be a parser which
prohibits the octet sequence 2F 2E 2E 2F ("/../"), yet permits the
illegal octet sequence 2F C0 AE 2E 2F.
</para>
</blockquote>

A longer discussion about this is available at
Markus Kuhn's

</para>

<para>
The UTF-8 character set is one case where it's possible to
enumerate all illegal values (and prove that you've enumerated them all).
If you need to determine if you have a legal UTF-8 sequence, you need
to check for two things: (1) is the initial sequence legal, and
(2) if it is, is the first byte followed by the required number of valid
continuation characters?
Performing the first check is easy; the following is provably
the complete list of all illegal UTF-8 initial sequences:

<table>

</tbody>
</tgroup>
</table>

</para>

<para>
I should note that in some cases, you might want to cut slack (or use
internally) the hexadecimal sequence C0 80.  This is an overlong sequence
that could represent ASCII NUL (NIL).  Since C/C++ have trouble
including a NIL character in an ordinary string, some people have taken
to using this sequence when they want to represent NIL as part of the
data stream; Java even enshrines the practice.
Feel free to use C0 80 internally while processing data, but technically
you really should translate this back to 00 before saving the data.
Depending on your needs, you might decide to be ``sloppy'' and accept
C0 80 as input in a UTF-8 data stream.
</para>

<para>
The second step is to check
if the correct number of continuation characters
are included in the string.
If the first byte has the top 2 bits set, you count the number of
``one'' bits set after the top one, and then check that there are that many
continuation bytes which begin with the bits ``10''.
So, binary 11100001 requires two more continuation bytes.
</para>

<para>
A related issue is that some phrases can be expressed in more than one
way in ISO 10646/Unicode.
For example, some accented characters can be represented as a single
character (with the accent) and also as a set of characters
(e.g., the base character plus a separate composing accent).
These two forms may appear identical.
There's also a zero-width space that could be inserted, with the
result that apparently-similar items are considered different.
Beware of situations where such hidden text could interfere with the program.

An enemy will overrun the land;
he will pull down your strongholds and
plunder your fortresses.
</para>
</epigraph>

<para>
An extremely common security flaw is the ``buffer overflow''.
Technically, a buffer overflow is a problem with the program's internal
implementation, but it's such a common and serious problem that
I've placed this information in its own chapter.
To give you an idea of how important this subject is,
at the CERT, 9 of 13 advisories in 1998 and at least half of
the 1999 advisories involved buffer overflows.
An informal survey on Bugtraq found that approximately 2/3 of the
respondents felt that buffer overflows were the leading cause of
security vulnerability (the remaining respondents identified
``misconfiguration'' as the leading cause) [Cowan 1999].
This is an old, well-known problem, yet it continues to resurface
[McGraw 2000].
<!-- ???: Get the stats from the libsafe paper -->
</para>

<para>
A buffer overflow occurs when you write a set of values
(usually a string of characters) into a fixed length buffer
and write at least one value outside that buffer's boundaries
(usually past its end).
A buffer overflow can occur when reading input from the user into a buffer,
but it can also occur during other kinds of processing in a program.
</para>

<para>
If a secure program permits a buffer overflow, the overflow can often be
exploited by an adversary.
If the buffer is a local C variable, the overflow can be used to
force the function to run code of an attackers' choosing.
This specific variation is often called a ``stack smashing'' attack.
A buffer in the heap isn't much better; attackers may be able to
use such overflows to control other variables in the program.
More details can be found from Aleph1 [1996], Mudge [1995],
or the Nathan P. Smith's
"Stack Smashing Security Vulnerabilities" website at
<ulink
url="http://destroy.net/machines/security/">http://destroy.net/machines/security/</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
Most programming languages are essentially immune to this problem, either
because they automatically resize arrays (e.g., Perl), or because they normally
detect and prevent buffer overflows (e.g., Ada95).
However, the C language provides no protection against
such problems, and C++ can be easily used in ways to cause this problem too.
</para>

<sect1 id="dangers-c">
<title>Dangers in C/C++</title>

<para>
C users must avoid using dangerous functions that do not check bounds
unless they've ensured that the bounds will never get exceeded.
Functions to avoid in most cases (or ensure protection) include
the functions strcpy(3), strcat(3), sprintf(3)
(with cousin vsprintf(3)), and gets(3).
These should be replaced with functions such as strncpy(3), strncat(3),
snprintf(3), and fgets(3) respectively, but see the discussion below.
The function strlen(3) should be avoided unless you can ensure that there
will be a terminating NIL character to find.
The scanf() family (scanf(3), fscanf(3),  sscanf(3),  vscanf(3),
vsscanf(3), and vfscanf(3)) is often dangerous to use; do not use it
to send data to a string without controlling the maximum length
(the format %s is a particularly common problem).
Other dangerous functions that may permit buffer overruns (depending on their
use) include
realpath(3), getopt(3), getpass(3),
streadd(3), strecpy(3), and strtrns(3).
You must careful with getwd(3); the buffer sent to getwd(3) must be
at least PATH_MAX bytes long.
</para>

<para>
Unfortunately, snprintf()'s variants have additional problems.
Officially, snprintf() is not a standard C function in the ISO 1990
(ANSI 1989) standard, though sprintf() is,
so not all systems include snprintf().
Even worse, some systems' snprintf() do not actually protect
against buffer overflows; they just call sprintf directly.
Old versions of Linux's libc4 depended on a ``libbsd'' that did this
horrible thing, and I'm told that some old HP systems did the same.
Linux's current version of snprintf is known to work correctly, that is, it
does actually respect the boundary requested.
The return value of snprintf() varies as well;
the Single Unix Specification (SUS) version 2
and the upcoming C99 standard differ on what is returned by snprintf().
Finally, it appears that at least some versions of
snprintf don't guarantee that its string will end in NIL; if the
string is too long, it won't include NIL at all.
Note that the glib library (the basis of GTK, and not the same as the
GNU C library glibc) has a g_snprintf(), which
has a consistent return semantic, always NIL-terminates, and
most importantly always respects the buffer length.

The first subsection describes the ``standard C library'' solution, which

fixed length and dynamically reallocated approaches to buffers.
The following subsections describe various alternative libraries,

</para>

<sect2 id="buffer-standard-solution">
<title>Standard C Library Solution</title>

<para>
The ``standard'' solution to prevent buffer overflow in C
is to use the standard C library calls that defend against these
problems.
This approach depends heavily on the standard library functions
strncpy(3) and strncat(3).
If you choose this approach, beware: these calls have somewhat surprising
semantics and are hard to use correctly.
The function strncpy(3) does not NIL-terminate the destination string
if the source string length is at least equal to the destination's, so
be sure to set the last character of the destination string to NIL after
calling strncpy(3).
If you're going to reuse the same buffer many times,
an efficient approach is to tell strncpy() that the buffer is one
character shorter than it actually is and set the last character to
NIL once before use.
Both strncpy(3) and strncat(3) require that you pass
the amount of space left available, a computation
that is easy to get wrong (and getting it wrong could permit a
buffer overflow attack).
Neither provide a simple mechanism to determine if an overflow has occurred.
Finally, strncpy(3) has a significant performance penalty compared
to the strcpy(3) it supposedly replaces,
because <emphasis remap="it">strncpy(3) NIL-fills the remainder of the destination</emphasis>.
I've gotten emails expressing surprise over this last point, but this is
clearly stated in Kernighan and Ritchie second edition
[Kernighan 1988, page 249], and this behavior is clearly documented in
the man pages for Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris.
This means that just changing from strcpy to strncpy can cause a severe
reduction in performance, for no good reason in most cases.

<!-- from Hudin Lucian, BUGTRAQ - 29 Jun 2000 -->
<!-- David A. Wheeler checked it and found that it was WRONG - 18 July 2000 -->
One posting on bugtraq claimed that you can use sprintf()
without buffer overflows by using the ``field width'' capability of sprintf().
Unfortunately, this isn't true; the field width specifies a minimum
width, not a maximum, so overlong strings can still overflow a
fixed-length buffer even with field width specifiers.
Here's an example of this approach that doesn't work:
<programlisting width="61">

 char buf[BUFSIZ];
 sprintf(buf, "%.*s", BUFSIZ, "big-long-string");

<title>Static and Dynamically Allocated Buffers</title>

<para>
strncpy and friends are an example of statically allocated buffers, that
is, once the buffer is allocated it stays a fixed size.
The alternative is to dynamically reallocate buffer sizes as you need them.
It turns out that both approaches have security implications.
</para>

<para>
<!-- Thanks to Ryan McCabe (thanks.odin@numb.org) for the comment
     that fixed-length buffers have their own exploitable problems. -->
There is a general security problem when using fixed-length buffers: the fact
that the buffer is a fixed length may be exploitable.
This is a problem with strncpy(3) and strncat(3), snprintf(3),
strlcpy(3), strlcat(3), and other such functions.
The basic idea is that the attacker sets up a really long string so that,
when the string is truncated, the final result will be what the
attacker wanted (instead of what the developer intended).
Perhaps the string is catenated from several smaller
pieces; the attacker might make the first piece as long as the entire
buffer, so all later attempts to concatenate strings do nothing.
Here are some specific examples:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<para>
Imagine code that calls gethostbyname(3) and, if
successful, immediately copies hostent-&#62;h&lowbar;name to a
fixed-size buffer using strncpy or snprintf.
Using strncpy or snprintf protects against an overflow of an excessively
long fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), so you might think you're done.
However, this could result in chopping off the end of the FQDN.
This may be very undesirable, depending on what happens next.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
Imagine code that uses strncpy, strncat, snprintf, etc., to copy the
full path of a filesystem object to some buffer.
Further imagine that the original value was provided by an
untrusted user, and that the copying is part of a process to pass a
resulting computation to a function.
Sounds safe, right?
Now imagine that an attacker pads a path
with a large number of '/'s at the beginning.  This could
result in future operations being performed on the file ``/''.
If the program appends values in the belief that the result will be safe,
the program may be exploitable.
Or, the attacker could devise a long filename near the buffer length, so that
attempts to append to the filename would silently fail to occur
(or only partially occur in ways that may be exploitable).
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</para>

<para>
When using statically-allocated buffers,
you really need to consider the length of the source and destination arguments.
Sanity checking the input and the resulting intermediate computation might
deal with this, too.
</para>

<para>
Another alternative is to dynamically reallocate all strings instead of using
fixed-size buffers.
This general approach is recommended by the GNU programming guidelines,
since it permits programs to handle arbitrarily-sized inputs
(until they run out of memory).
Of course, the major problem with dynamically allocated strings is that you
may run out of memory.  The memory may even be exhausted at some other
point in the program than the portion where you're worried about buffer
overflows; any memory allocation can fail.
Also, since dynamic reallocation may cause memory to be inefficiently
allocated, it is entirely possible to run out of memory even though
technically there is enough virtual memory available to the program
to continue.
In addition, before running out of memory the program will probably
use a great deal of virtual memory; this can easily result in
``thrashing'', a situation in which the computer spends all its time
just shuttling information between the disk and memory (instead of
doing useful work).
This can have the effect of a denial of service attack.
Some rational limits on input size can help here.
In general, the program must be designed to
fail safely when memory is exhausted if you use dynamically allocated strings.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="strlcpy">
<title>strlcpy and strlcat</title>

<para>
An alternative, being employed by OpenBSD, is the
strlcpy(3) and strlcat(3) functions by Miller and de Raadt [Miller 1999].
This is a minimalist, statically-sized buffer approach that provides C string
copying and concatenation with a different (and less error-prone) interface.
Source and documentation of these functions
are available under a newer BSD-style open source license at
<ulink
url="ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/src/lib/libc/string/strlcpy.3">ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/src/lib/libc/string/strlcpy.3</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
First, here are their prototypes:

<screen width="61">
size_t strlcpy (char *dst, const char *src, size_t size);
size_t strlcat (char *dst, const char *src, size_t size);
</screen>

Both strlcpy and strlcat
take the full size of the destination buffer as a parameter
(not the maximum number of characters to be copied) and guarantee to
NIL-terminate the result (as long as size is larger than 0).
Remember that you should include a byte for NIL in the size.
</para>

<para>
The strlcpy function copies up to
size-1 characters from the NUL-terminated string src to dst,
NIL-terminating the result.
The strlcat
function appends the NIL-terminated string
src to the end of dst.
It will append at most 
size - strlen(dst) - 1 bytes, NIL-terminating the result.
</para>

<para>
One minor disadvantage of strlcpy(3) and strlcat(3) is that they are
not, by default, installed in most Unix-like systems.
In OpenBSD, they are part of &lt;string.h&gt;.
This is not that difficult a problem; since they are small functions, you can
even include them in your own program's source (at least as an option),
and create a small separate package to load them.
You can even use autoconf to handle this case automatically.
If more programs use these functions, it won't be long before these are
standard parts of Linux distributions and other Unix-like systems.
Also, these functions have been
been recently added to the ``glib'' library (I submitted the patch
to do this), so using glib will (in the future) make them available.
In glib these functions are named g_strlcpy() and g_strlcat.

<title>Libsafe</title>

<para>
Arash Baratloo, Timothy Tsai, and Navjot Singh
(of Lucent Technologies)
have developed Libsafe, a wrapper of several library functions known to be
vulnerable to stack smashing attacks.
This wrapper (which they call a kind of ``middleware'')
is a simple dynamically loaded library that contains modified versions
of C library functions such as strcpy(3).
These modified versions
implement the original functionality, but in a manner that ensures
that any buffer overflows are contained within the current stack frame.
Their initial performance analysis suggests that this
library's overhead is very small.
Libsafe papers and source code are available at
<ulink url="http://www.bell-labs.com/org/11356/libsafe.html">http://www.bell-labs.com/org/11356/libsafe.html</ulink>.
The Libsafe source code is available under the completely
open source LGPL license,
and there are indications that many Linux distributors are interested
in using it.
</para>

<para>
Libsafe's approach appears somewhat useful.
Libsafe should certainly be considered for inclusion by Linux
distributors, and its approach is worth considering by others as well.
However, as a software developer, Libsafe is a useful mechanism
to support defense-in-depth but it does not really prevent buffer
overflows.
Here are several reasons why you shouldn't depend just on Libsafe
during code development:
<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>
Libsafe only protects a small set of known functions with obvious
buffer overflow issues.
At the time of this writing, this list is significantly shorter than
the list of functions in this paper known to have this problem.
It also won't protect against code you write yourself (e.g., in
a while loop) that causes buffer overflows.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Even if libsafe is installed in a distribution, the way it is installed
impacts its use.
The documentation recommends setting LD_PRELOAD 
to cause libsafe's protections to be enabled, but the problem
is that users can unset this environment variable... causing the
protection to be disabled for programs they execute!
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Libsafe only protects against buffer overflows of the stack onto the
return address;
you can still overrun the heap or other variables in that procedure's frame.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Unless you can be assured that all deployed platforms will use libsafe
(or something like it), you'll have to protect your program as though
it wasn't there.
</para></listitem>


<listitem><para>
LibSafe seems to assume that saved frame pointers are at the beginning of
each stack frame.  This isn't always true. 
Compilers (such as gcc) can optimize away things, and in particular the
option "-fomit-frame-pointer" removes the information that libsafe
seems to need.
Thus, libsafe may fail to work for some programs.

The glib (not glibc) library is a widely-available
open source library that provides
a number of useful functions for C programmers.
GTK+ and GNOME both use glib, for example.
As I noted earlier, glib version 2.0 will include strlcpy() and strlcat()
(through my patch),
making it easier to portably use those functions.
At this time I do not have an analysis showing definitively that the
glib library functions protect against buffer overflow.
However, many of the glib functions automatically allocate memory,
and those functions automatically
<emphasis>fail with no reasonable way to intercept the failure</emphasis>
(e.g., to try something else instead).
As a result, in many cases most glib functions cannot
be used in most secure programs.
The GNOME guidelines recommend using functions such as
g_strdup_printf(), which is fine as long as it's okay if your program
immediately crashes if an out-of-memory condition occurs.
However, if you can't do this, then using such routines isn't approriate.

<title>Compilation Solutions in C/C++</title>

<para>
A completely different approach is to use compilation methods that perform
bounds-checking (see [Sitaker 1999] for a list).
In my opinion, such tools are very useful in having multiple layers of
defense, but it's not wise to use this technique as your sole defense.
There are at least two reasons for this.
First of all, most such tools only provide partial defense against
buffer overflows (and the ``complete'' defenses are generally
12-30 times slower); C and C++ were simply not designed to protect
against buffer overflow.
Second of all, for open source programs you cannot be certain what tools
will be used to compile the program; using the default ``normal'' compiler
for a given system might suddenly open security flaws.
</para>

<para>
One of the more useful tools is ``StackGuard'', a modification of the
standard GNU C compiler gcc.
StackGuard works by inserting a ``guard'' value (called a ``canary'')
in front of the return address; if a buffer overflow
overwrites the return address, the canary's value (hopefully) changes
and the system detects this before using it.
This is quite valuable, but note that this does not protect against
buffer overflows overwriting other values (which they may still be able
to use to attack a system).
There is work to extend StackGuard to be able to add canaries to other
data items, called ``PointGuard''.
PointGuard will automatically protect certain values (e.g., function
pointers and longjump buffers).
However, protecting other variable types using PointGuard
requires specific programmer intervention (the programmer
has to identify which data values must be protected with canaries).
This can be valuable, but it's easy to accidentally omit
protection for a data value you didn't think needed protection -
but needs it anyway.
More information on StackGuard, PointGuard, and other alternatives
is in Cowan [1999].
</para>

<para>
As a related issue, in Linux you could modify the Linux kernel so that
the stack segment is not executable; such a patch to Linux does exist
(see Solar Designer's patch, which includes this, at
<ulink
url="http://www.openwall.com/linux/">http://www.openwall.com/linux/</ulink>
However, as of this writing this is not built into the Linux kernel.
Part of the rationale is that this is less protection than it seems;
attackers can simply force the system to call other ``interesting'' locations
already in the program (e.g., in its library, the heap,
or static data segments).
Also, sometimes Linux does require executable code in the stack,
e.g., to implement signals and to implement GCC ``trampolines''.
Solar Designer's patch does handle these cases, but this does
complicate the patch.
Personally, I'd like to see this merged into the main Linux
distribution, since it does make attacks somewhat more difficult and
it defends against a range of existing attacks.
However, I agree with Linus Torvalds and others
that this does not add the amount of protection it would appear to and
can be circumvented with relative ease.
You can read Linus Torvalds' explanation for not including this support at
<ulink

</para>

<para>
In short, it's better to work first on developing a correct program
that defends itself against buffer overflows.
Then, after you've done this, by all means use techniques and tools
like StackGuard as an additional safety net.
If you've worked hard to eliminate buffer overflows in the code itself,
then StackGuard is likely to be more effective because there will be
fewer ``chinks in the armor'' that StackGuard will be called on to protect.

The problem of buffer overflows is an excellent argument for using
other programming languages
such as Perl, Python, Java, and Ada95.
After all, nearly all other programming languages used today
(other than assembly language) protect against buffer overflows.
Using those other languages does not eliminate all problems, of course;
in particular see the discussion in <xref linkend="limit-call-outs">
regarding the NIL character.
There is also the problem of ensuring that those other languages'
infrastructure (e.g., run-time library) is available and secured.
Still, you should certainly consider using other programming languages
when developing secure programs to protect against buffer overflows.

<title>Minimize Privileges</title>

<para>
As noted earlier, it is an important general
principle that programs have the minimal amount of privileges
necessary to do its job (this is termed ``least privilege'').
That way, if the program is broken, its damage is limited.
The most extreme example is to simply not write a secure program at all -
if this can be done, it usually should be.
For example, don't make your program setuid or setgid if you can; just
make it an ordinary program, and require the administrator to log in as such
before running it.
</para>

<para>
In Linux and Unix, the primary determiner of a process' privileges is the set of
id's associated with it:
each process has a real, effective and saved id for both the user and group.
Linux also has the filesystem uid and gid.
Manipulating these values is critical to keeping privileges minimized,
and there are several ways to minimize them (discussed below).
You can also use chroot(2) to minimize the files visible to a program.
</para>

<sect2 id="mimimize-privileges-granted">
<title>Minimize the Privileges Granted</title>

<para>
Perhaps the most effective technique is to simply minimize the
the highest privilege granted.
In particular, avoid granting a program root privilege if possible.
Don't make a program <emphasis remap="it">setuid root</emphasis> if it only needs access
to a small set of files;
consider creating separate user or group accounts for different function.
</para>

<para>
A common technique is to
create a special group, change a file's group ownership to that group,
and then make the program <emphasis remap="it">setgid</emphasis> to that group.
It's better to make a program <emphasis remap="it">setgid</emphasis> instead of <emphasis remap="it">setuid</emphasis>
where you can,
since group membership grants fewer rights (in particular, it does not
grant the right to change file permissions).
</para>

<para>
This is commonly done for game high scores.
Games are usually setgid <emphasis remap="it">games</emphasis>,
the score files are owned by the group <emphasis remap="it">games</emphasis>,
and the programs themselves and their configuration files
are owned by someone else (say root).
Thus, breaking into a game allows the perpetrator to change high scores but
doesn't grant the privilege to change the game's executable or
configuration file.
The latter is important; if an attacker could change a game's executable
or its configuration files (which might control what the executable runs),
then they might be able to gain control of a user who ran the game.
</para>

<para>
If creating a new group isn't sufficient, consider creating a
new pseudouser (really, a special role) to manage a set of resources.
Web servers typically do this; often web servers are set up with a special
user (``nobody'') so that they can be isolated from other users.
Indeed, web servers are instructive here: web servers typically need
root privileges to start up (so they can attach to port 80), but once
started they usually shed all their privileges and
run as the user ``nobody''.
Again, usually the pseudouser doesn't own the primary program it runs,
so breaking into the account doesn't allow for changing the program itself.
As a result, breaking into a running web server normally does not
automatically break the whole system's security.
</para>

<para>
If you <emphasis remap="it">must</emphasis> give a program root privileges,
consider using the POSIX capability features available in Linux 2.2 and
greater to minimize them immediately on program startup.
By calling cap&lowbar;set&lowbar;proc(3) or the Linux-specific capsetp(3) 
routines immediately after starting, you can permanently
reduce the abilities of your program to just those abilities it actually needs.
Note that <emphasis remap="it">not</emphasis> all Unix-like systems implement POSIX capabilities,
so this is an approach that can lose portability; however, if you use it
merely as an optional safeguard only where it's available, using this
approach will not really limit portability.
Also, while the Linux kernel version 2.2 and greater includes the low-level
calls, the C-level libraries to make their use easy are not installed
on some Linux distributions, slightly complicating their use in applications.

One Linux-unique tool you can use to simplify minimizing granted privileges
is the ``compartment'' tool developed by SuSE.
This tool sets the fileystem root, uid, gid, and/or the
capability set, then runs the given program.
This is particularly handy for running some other program without
modifying it.
Here's the syntax of version 0.5:

<screen width="61">

Syntax: compartment [options] /full/path/to/program

Options:
  --chroot path   chroot to path
  --user user     change uid to this user
  --group group   change gid to this group
  --init program  execute this program before doing anything
  --cap capset    set capset name. You can specify several
  --verbose       be verbose
  --quiet         do no logging (to syslog)

<title>Minimize the Time the Privilege Can Be Used</title>

<para>
As soon as possible, permanently give up privileges.
Some Unix-like systems, including Linux,
implement ``saved'' IDs which store the ``previous'' value.
The simplest approach is to set the other id's twice to an untrusted id.
In setuid/setgid programs, you should usually set the effective gid and uid
to the real ones, in particular right after a fork(2),
unless there's a good reason not to.
Note that you have to change the gid first when dropping from root to another
privilege or it won't work - once you drop root privileges, you won't
be able to change much else.
</para>

<para>
It's worth noting that there's a well-known related bug that
uses POSIX capabilities to interfere with this minimization.
This bug affects Linux kernel 2.2.0 through 2.2.15, and possibly a number
of other Unix-like systems with POSIX capabilities.
See Bugtraq id 1322 on http://www.securityfocus.com for more information.
Here is their summary:
<blockquote><para>
POSIX "Capabilities" have recently been implemented in the Linux kernel.
These "Capabilities" are an additional form of privilege control to enable
more specific control over what priviliged processes can do. Capabilities are
implemented as three (fairly large) bitfields, which each bit representing a
specific action a privileged process can perform. By setting specific bits, the
actions of priviliged processes can be controlled -- access can be granted for
various functions only to the specific parts of a program that require them.
It is a security measure. The problem is that capabilities are copied with
fork() execs, meaning that if capabilities are modified by a parent process,
they can be carried over. The way that this can be exploited is by setting all
of the capabilities to zero (meaning, all of the bits are off) in each of the
three bitfields and then executing a setuid program that attempts to drop
priviliges before executing code that could be dangerous if run as root, such
as what sendmail does. When sendmail attempts to drop priviliges using
setuid(getuid()), it fails not having the capabilities required to do so in its
bitfields and with no checks on its return value . It continues executing with
superuser priviliges, and can run a users .forward file as root leading to a
complete compromise.
</para></blockquote>
One approach, used by sendmail, is to attempt to do
setuid(0) after a setuid(getuid()); normally this should fail.
If it succeeds, the program should stop.
For more information, see
http://sendmail.net/?feed=000607linuxbug.
In the short term this might be a good idea in
other programs, though clearly the better
long-term approach is to upgrade the underlying system.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="minimize-time-privilege-active">
<title>Minimize the Time the Privilege is Active</title>

<para>
Use setuid(2), seteuid(2), and related functions to ensure that the program
only has these privileges active when necessary.
As noted above, you might want ensure that these privileges are disabled
while parsing user input, but more generally, only turn on privileges when
they're actually needed.
Note that some buffer overflow attacks, if successful, can force a program
to run arbitrary code, and that code could re-enable privileges that were
temporarily dropped.
Thus, it's always better to completely drop privileges as soon as
possible.
Still, temporarily disabling these permissions
prevents a whole class of attacks,
such as techniques to convince a program to write into a file that
perhaps it didn't intent to write into.
Since this technique prevents many attacks,
it's worth doing if completely dropping the privileges can't be done
at that point in the program.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="minimize-privileged-modules">
<title>Minimize the Modules Granted the Privilege</title>

<para>
If only a few modules are granted the privilege, then it's much
easier to determine if they're secure.
One way to do so is to have a single module use the
privilege and then drop it, so that other modules called later cannot misuse
the privilege.
Another approach is to have separate commands in separate
executables; one command might be a complex
tool that can do a vast number of tasks for a privileged user (e.g., root),
while the other tool is setuid but is a small, simple tool that
only permits a small command subset.
The small, simple tool checks to see if the input meets various criteria for
acceptability, and then if it determines the input is acceptable, it
passes the input is passed to the tool.
This can even be layerd several ways, for example,
a complex user tool could call a simple setuid
``wrapping'' program (that checks its inputs for secure values)
that then passes on information to another complex trusted tool.
This approach is especially helpful for GUI-based systems; have the GUI portion
run as a normal user, and then pass security-relevant
requests on to another program
that has the special privileges for actual execution.
</para>

<para>
Some operating systems have the concept of multiple
layers of trust in a single process, e.g., Multics' rings.
Standard Unix and Linux don't have a way of separating multiple levels of trust
by function inside a single process
like this; a call to the kernel increases privileges,
but otherwise a given process has a single level of trust.
Linux and other Unix-like systems can sometimes
simulate this ability by forking a process into
multiple processes, each of which has different privilege.
To do this, set up a secure communication channel
(usually unnamed pipes or unnamed sockets are used),
then fork into different processes and have each process
drop as many privileges as possible.
Then use a simple protocol to allow the less trusted processes
to request actions from the more trusted process(es), and ensure that the more
trusted processes only support a limited set of requests.
</para>

<para>
This is one area where technologies like Java 2 and Fluke have an advantage.
For example,
Java 2 can specify fine-grained permissions such as the permission to
only open a specific file.
However, general-purpose operating systems do not typically
have such abilities at this time; this may change in the near future.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="consider-fsuid">
<title>Consider Using FSUID To Limit Privileges</title>

<para>
Each Linux process has two Linux-unique state values called
filesystem user id (fsuid) and filesystem group id (fsgid).
These values are used when checking against the filesystem permissions.
If you're building a program that operates as a file server for arbitrary
users (like an NFS server), you might consider using these Linux extensions.
To use them, while holding root privileges change
just fsuid and fsgid before accessing files on behalf of a normal user.
This extension is fairly useful, and provides a mechanism for limiting
filesystem access rights without removing other (possibly necessary) rights.
By only setting the fsuid (and not the euid), a local user cannot send
a signal to the process.
Also, avoiding race conditions is much easier in this situation.
However, a disadvantage of this approach
is that these calls are not portable to other Unix-like systems.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="consider-chroot">
<title>Consider Using Chroot to Minimize Available Files</title>

<para>
You can use chroot(2) to limit the files visible to your program.
This requires carefully setting up a directory (called the ``chroot jail'')
and correctly entering it.
This can be a fairly effective technique for improving a program's
security - it's hard to interfere with files you can't see.
However, it depends on a whole bunch of assumptions, in particular,
the program must lack root privileges, it must not have any way to get
root privileges, and the chroot jail must be properly set up.
I recommend using chroot(2) where it makes sense to do so, but don't depend
on it alone; instead, make it part of a layered set of defenses.
Here are a few notes about the use of chroot(2):

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<para>
The program can still use non-filesystem objects that are shared
across the entire machine
(such as System V IPC objects and network sockets).
It's best to also
use separate pseudousers and/or groups, because all Unix-like systems include
the ability to isolate users; this will at least limit the damage
a subverted program can do to other programs.
Note that current most Unix-like systems (including Linux)
won't isolate intentionally cooperating programs; if you're worried about
malicious programs cooperating, you need to get a system that implements
some sort of mandatory access control and/or limits covert channels.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
Be sure to close any filesystem descriptors to outside files if you
don't want them used later.
In particular, don't have any descriptors open to directories outside
the chroot jail, or set up a situation where such a descriptor could be
given to it (e.g., via Unix sockets or an old implementation of /proc).
If the program is given a descriptor to a directory outside the chroot jail,
it could be used to escape out of the chroot jail.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
The chroot jail has to be set up to be secure.
Don't use a normal user's home directory (or subdirectory) as a chroot jail;
use a separate location or ``home'' directory specially set aside
for the purpose.
<!-- http://msgs.securepoint.com/cgi-bin/get/bugtraq0004/64/1/1/2.html -->
Place the absolute minimum number of files there.
Typically you'll have a /bin, /etc/, /lib, and maybe one or two others
(e.g., /pub if it's an ftp server).
Place in /bin only what you need to run after doing the chroot(); sometimes
you need nothing at all (try to avoid placing a shell there, though sometimes
that can't be helped).
You may need a /etc/passwd and /etc/group so file listings can show
some correct names, but if so, try not to include the real system's
values, and certainly replace all passwords with "*".
In /lib, place only what you need; use ldd(1) to query each program in /bin
to find out what it needs, and only include them.
On Linux, you'll probably need a few basic libraries like ld-linux.so.2, and
not much else.
It's usually wiser to completely copy in all files, instead of making
hard links; while this wastes some time and disk space, it makes it so that
attacks on the chroot jail files do not automatically propogate into the
regular system's files.
Mounting a /proc filesystem, on systems where this is supported, is
generally unwise. In fact, in 2.0.x versions of Linux it's a
known security flaw, since there are pseudodirectories in /proc that
would permit a chroot'ed program to escape.
Linux kernel 2.2 fixed this known problem, but there may be others; if
possible, don't do it.
</para>

</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
Chroot really isn't effective if 
the program can acquire root privilege.
For example, the program could use calls like mknod(2) to create a device
file that can view physical memory, and then use the resulting
device file to modify kernel memory to give itself
whatever privileges it desired.
Another example of how a root program can break out of chroot
is demonstrated at
<ulink
url="http://www.suid.edu/source/breakchroot.c">http://www.suid.edu/source/breakchroot.c</ulink>.
In this example, the program opens a file descriptor for
the current directory, creates and chroots into a subdirectory, sets
the current directory to the previously-opened current directory,
repeatedly cd's up from the current directory (which since it is
outside the current chroot succeeds in moving up to the real filesystem
root), and then calls chroot on the result.
By the time you read this, these weaknesses may have been plugged,
but the reality is that root privilege has traditionally meant ``all
privileges'' and it's hard to strip them away.
It's better to assume that a program requiring continuous root privileges
will only be mildly helped using chroot().
Of course, you may be able to break your program into parts, so that
at least part of it can be in a chroot jail.

<title>Avoid Creating Setuid/Setgid Scripts</title>

Many Unix-like systems, in particular Linux, simply ignore the

described earlier.
Since support for setuid scripts varies on Unix-like systems,
they're best avoided in new applications where possible.
As a special case, Perl includes a special setup to support setuid Perl
scripts, so using setuid and setgid is acceptable in Perl if you
truly need this kind of functionality.
If you need to support this kind of functionality in your own
interpreter, examine how Perl does this.
Otherwise, a simple approach is to ``wrap'' the script with a small
setuid/setgid executable that creates a safe environment
(e.g., clears and sets environment variables) and then
calls the script (using the script's full path).
Make sure that the script cannot be changed by an attacker!

Please don't create ``sample'' working users or

In some cases the program may be able to determine that a more generous

<sect1 id="fail-safe">
<title>Fail Safe</title>

<para>
A secure program should always ``fail safe'', that is,
it should be designed so that if the program does fail, the safest
result should occur.
For security-critical programs, that usually means that
if some sort of misbehavior is detected (malformed input,
reaching a ``can't get here'' state, and so on), then the program
should immediately deny service and stop processing that request.
Don't try to ``figure out what the user wanted'': just deny the service.
Sometimes this can decrease reliability or usability
(from a user's perspective), but it increases security.
There are a few cases where this might not be desired (e.g., where denial of
service is much worse than loss of confidentiality or integrity), but
such cases are quite rare.
</para>

<para>
Note that I recommend ``stop processing the request'', not ``fail altogether''.
In particular, most servers should not completely halt when given malformed
input, because that creates a trivial opportunity for a denial of service
attack (the attacker just sends garbage bits to prevent you from using the
service).
Sometimes taking the whole server down is necessary, in particular,
reaching some ``can't get here'' states may signal a problem so drastic
that continuing is unwise.
</para>

<para>
Consider carefully what error message you send back when a failure is detected.
if you send nothing
back, it may be hard to diagnose problems, but sending back too much
information may unintentionally aid an attacker.
Usually the best approach is to reply with ``access denied'' or

<title>Avoid Race Conditions</title>

<para>
A ``race condition'' can be defined as
``Anomolous behavior due to unexpected critical dependence
on the relative timing of events''
[FOLDOC].
Race conditions generally involve one or more processes
accessing a shared resource (such a file or variable), where this
multiple access has not been properly controlled.
</para>

<para>
In general, processes do not execute atomically;
another process may interrupt it between essentially any two instructions.
If a secure program's process is not prepared for these interruptions,
another process may be able to interfere with the secure program's process.
Any pair of operations must not fail if another process's code arbitrary
code is executed between them. 
</para>

<para>
Race condition problems can be notionally divided into two categories:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
Interference caused by untrusted processes.
Some security taxonomies call this problem a
``sequence'' or ``non-atomic'' condition.
These are conditions caused by processes running other, different programs,
which ``slip in'' other actions between steps of the secure program.
These other programs might be invoked by an attacker specifically
to cause the problem.
This paper will call these sequencing problems.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
Interference caused by trusted processes (from the secure program's
point of view).
Some taxonomies call these deadlock, livelock, or locking failure conditions.
These are conditions caused by processes running the ``same'' program.
Since these different processes may have the ``same'' privileges, if
not properly controlled they may be able to interfere with each other in
a way other programs can't.
Sometimes this kind of interference can be exploited.
This paper will call these locking problems.

<!-- http://webreview.com/wr/pub/97/08/08/bookshelf  Suggested
     this kind of division:

Sequence conditions: Be aware that your program does not
execute atomatically. That is, the program can be interrupted
between any two operations to let another program run for a
while-including one that is trying to abuse yours. Thus, check
your code carefully for any pair of operations that might fail if
arbitrary code is executed between them. 

 Deadlock conditions: Remember, more than one copy of your
program may be running at the same time. Use file locking for
any files that you modify.
Provide a way to recover the locks in
the event that the program crashes while a lock is held. Avoid
deadlocks or "deadly embraces," which can occur when one
program attempts to lock file A and then file B, while another
program already holds a lock for file B and then attempts to
lock file A.

you must check your code for any pair of operations that might fail if

</para>

<para>
Note that loading and saving a shared variable are usually implemented
as separate operations and are not atomic.
This means that an ``increment variable'' operation is usually converted into
loading, incrementing, and saving operation, so if the variable memory
is shared the other process may interfere with the incrementing.

<!-- ??? Extend this. -->
Secure programs must determine if a request should be granted, and if
so, act on that request.
There must be no way for an untrusted user to change anything used in
this determination before the program acts on it.
This kind of race condition is sometimes termed a
``time of check - time of use'' (TOCTOU) race condition.
</para>

<para>
This issue repeatedly comes up in the filesystem.
Programs should generally avoid using access(2) to determine
if a request should be granted, followed later by open(2), because users
may be able to move files around between these calls, possibly creating
symbolic links or files of their own choosing instead.
A secure program should instead set its effective id or filesystem id,
then make the open call directly.
It's possible to use access(2) securely, but only when a user cannot affect
the file or any directory along its path from the filesystem root.
</para>

<!-- From http://java.sun.com/security/seccodeguide.html:
For example, it's often better to use fchmod() and
fchown() instead of chmod(), chown(), and chgrp().
If you close a file and then use chmod() to change the permissions, and
the file or a directory in the directory's path is writeable by another,
an attacker may be able to remove the file and create a symbolic link
to another file (say /etc/passwd, to add/remove interesting values, or
to /dev/zero, to provide an infinitely-long data stream of input to
your program).

From http://webreview.com/wr/pub/97/08/08/bookshelf:
In particular, when you are performing a series of operations on a
file, such as changing its owner, stat ing the file, or changing its
mode, first open the file and then use the fchown( ), fstat( ), or
fchmod( ) system calls. Doing so will prevent the file from being
replaced while your program is running (a possible race condition).
Also avoid the use of the access( ) function to determine your ability
to access a file: using the access( ) function followed by an open( ) is
a race condition, and almost always a bug.

<!-- Based on http://java.sun.com/security/seccodeguide.html and

For example, when performing a series of operations on a file's
metainformation (such as changing its owner, stat-ing the file, or
changing its permission bits), first open the file and then use the
operations on open files.
This means use the fchown( ), fstat( ), or fchmod( ) system calls,
instead of the functions taking filenames
such as chown(), chgrp(), and chmod().
Doing so will prevent the file from being
replaced while your program is running (a possible race condition).
For example, if you close a file and then use chmod()
to change its permissions,
an attacker may be able to remove the file between those
two steps and create a symbolic link to another file
(say /etc/passwd).
Other interesting files include /dev/zero, which can
provide an infinitely-long data stream of input to a program.
Also, avoid the use of the access( ) function to determine your ability
to access a file: using the access( ) function followed by an open( ) is

This is only necessary if it's possible for an untrusted process
to modify the relevant directory its ancestors.
</para>

<para>
This issue particularly comes up in the /tmp and /var/tmp directories,
which are shared by all users.  Avoid using these directories
and their subdirectories if possible.
In particular, imagine what would happen if users created files
(including symbolic links) at arbitrary times in directories you intend to use
(for example, between the time you compute a filename
and the time you try to open it).
A common trick is for attackers to create symbolic links in the
temporary directory to some other file (e.g., /etc/passwd)
while your secure program is running.
The goal is to create a situation where the secure program determines that
a given filename doesn't exist, the attacker then creates the symbolic
link to another file, and then the secure program opens the file
(but now it actually opened an unintended file).
Often important files can be clobbered or modified this way.
</para>

<para>
The general problem when creating files in these shared directories is that
you must guarantee that the filename you plan to use doesn't already
exist at time of creation (checking ``before'' you create it doesn't work).
Using an ``unpredictable'' or ``unique'' filename doesn't work, because
another process can often repeatedly guess what that value will be.
The GNOME programming guidelines recommend the following C code when
creating filesystem objects in shared (temporary) directories
to counteract this problem [Quintero 2000]:
<programlisting width="68">
 char *filename;
 int fd;

 do {
   filename = tempnam (NULL, "foo");
   fd = open (filename, O_CREAT | O_EXCL | O_TRUNC | O_RDWR, 0600);
   free (filename);
 } while (fd == -1);
</programlisting>
Note that you need to free() the filename.
You should close() and unlink() the file after you are done.
If you want to use the Standard C I/O library,
you can use fdopen() to transform the file descriptor into a FILE *.
Note that this won't work over NFS version 2 (v2) systems, because older
NFS doesn't correctly support O_EXCL.
<!-- They also say you can use tmpfile() to do it in one step; I want
     to verify this before saying so. I'm concerned that some 
     implementations may not "do it correctly", and it's better to
     re-implement than be insecure. -->
<!-- http://developer.gnome.org/doc/guides/programming-guidelines/security.html -->
</para>


<!-- ???: I need to completely rewrite this race condition section -->

<!-- Not quite the right idea:
You can't even just check to see if the given file is a symbolic link;
if it's owned by an untrusted user, the user could change this after
the check.
One possible tool is the O_NOFOLLOW option for open(), a
FreeBSD extension also supported by Linux; this option says to not
follow symbolic links if the link the final portion of the path.
Unfortunately at this time this option is not portable.

<sect2 id="locking">
<title>Locking</title>

<para>
There are often situations in which a program must ensure that it has
exclusive rights to something (e.g., a file, a device, and/or
existence of a particular server process).
Any system which locks resources must deal with the standard problems
of locks, namely, deadlocks (``deadly embraces''), livelocks,
and releasing ``stuck'' locks if a program doesn't clean up its locks.
A deadlock can occur if programs are stuck waiting for each other to
release resources.
For example, a deadlock would occur if
process 1 locks resources A and waits for resource B,
while process 2 locks resource B and waits for resource A.
Many deadlocks can be prevented by simply requiring all processes
that lock multiple resources to lock them
in the same order (e.g., alphabetically by lock name).
</para>

<sect3 id="locking-using-files">
<title>Using Files as Locks</title>

<para>
On Unix-like systems resource locking has traditionally been done by creating
a file to indicate a lock, because this is very portable.
It also makes it easy to ``fix'' stuck locks, because an administrator
can just look at the filesystem to see what locks have been set.
Stuck locks can occur because the program failed to clean up after
itself (e.g., it crashed or malfunctioned) or because the whole system crashed.
Note that these are ``advisory'' (not ``mandatory'') locks - all processes
needed the resource must cooperate to use these locks.
<!-- ??? Discuss various approaches to resolve this, e.g.,
There are some standard tricks to simplify clean-up for these
conditions.
For example, a parent process can set a lock,
call a child to do the work (make sure only the parent can call the child
in a way that it can work), and when the child returns the parent releases
the lock.
Or, a cron job can look at the locks (which contain a process id); if
the process isn't alive, it would erase the lock and restart the process.
Finally, the lock file can be erased as part of system start-up.
-->
</para>

<para>
However, there are several traps to avoid.
First, don't use the technique used by
very old Unix C programs,
which is calling creat() or its open() equivalent, the open() mode
O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, with the file mode set to 0 (no permissions).
For normal users on normal file systems, this works, but
this approach fails to lock the file when the user has root privileges.
Root can always perform this operation, even when the file
already exists.
In fact, old versions of Unix had this particular problem in the
old editor ``ed'' -- the symptom was that
occasionally portions of the password file would be placed in user's files!
[Rochkind 1985, 22].
Instead, if you're creating a lock for processes that are on the local
filesystem, you should use open() with the flags
O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_EXCL (and again, no permissions, so that other
processes with the same owner won't get the lock).
Note the use of O_EXCL, which is the official way to
create ``exclusive'' files; this even works for root on a local filesystem.
[Rochkind 1985, 27].
</para>

<para>
Second, if the lock file may be on an NFS-mounted filesystem, then you have
the problem that NFS version 2 doesn't completely support normal file semantics.
This can even be a problem for work that's supposed to be ``local'' to a
client, since some clients don't have local disks and may have <emphasis remap="it">all</emphasis>
files remotely mounted via NFS.
The manual for <emphasis remap="it">open(2)</emphasis> explains how to handle things in this case
(which also handles the case of root programs):
</para>

<para>
<QUOTE>... programs which rely on [the O&lowbar;CREAT and O&lowbar;EXCL flags of open(2)]
for performing locking tasks will contain a race condition. The solution
for performing atomic file locking using a lockfile is to create
a unique file on the same filesystem (e.g., incorporating
hostname and pid), use link(2) to make a link to
the lockfile and use stat(2) on the unique file to
check if its link count has increased to 2. Do
not use the return value of the link(2) call.</QUOTE>
</para>

<para>
Obviously, this solution only works if all programs doing the locking
are cooperating, and if all non-cooperating programs aren't allowed to
interfere.
In particular, the directories you're using for file locking
must not have permissive file permissions for creating and removing files.
</para>

<para>
NFS version 3 added support for O_EXCL mode in open(2);
see IETF RFC 1813,
in particular the "EXCLUSIVE" value to the "mode" argument of "CREATE".
Sadly, not everyone has switched to NFS version 3 or higher at the time of this
writing, so you you can't depend on this yet in portable programs.
Still, in the long run there's hope that this issue will go away.
</para>

<para>
If you're locking a device or the existence of a process on a local
machine, try to use standard conventions.
I recommend using the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS);
it is widely referenced by Linux systems, but it also tries to incorporate
the ideas of other Unix-like systems.
The FHS describes
standard conventions for such locking files, including naming, placement,
and standard contents of these files [FHS 1997].
If you just want to be sure that your server doesn't execute more than once
on a given machine, you should usually create a process identifier as
/var/run/NAME.pid with the pid as its contents.
In a similar vein, you should place lock files for things
like device lock files in /var/lock.
This approach has the minor disadvantage of leaving files hanging around
if the program suddenly halts,
but it's standard practice and that problem is
easily handled by other system tools.
</para>

<para>
It's important that the programs which are cooperating using files to
represent the locks use the same
directory, not just the same directory name.
This is an issue with networked systems: the FHS explicitly notes that
/var/run and /var/lock are unshareable, while /var/mail is shareable.
Thus, if you want the lock to work on a single machine, but not interfere
with other machines, use unshareable directories like /var/run
(e.g., you want to permit each machine to run its own server).
However, if you want all machines sharing files in a network to obey the
lock, you need to use a directory that they're sharing; /var/mail is
one such location.  See FHS section 2 for more information on this subject.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="other-locking">
<title>Other Approaches to Locking</title>

<para>
Of course, you need not use files to represent locks.
Network servers often need not bother; the mere act of binding to a port
acts as a kind of lock, since if there's an existing server bound to a given
port, no other server will be able to bind to that port.
</para>

<para>
Another approach to locking
is to use POSIX record locks, implemented through fcntl(2) as a
``discretionary lock''.
These are discretionary, that is, using them requires the cooperation of the
programs needing the locks (just as the approach to using files to
represent locks does).
There's a lot to recommend POSIX record locks:
POSIX record locking is supported on nearly all Unix-like platforms
(it's mandated by POSIX.1), it
can lock portions of a file (not just a whole file), and it can handle the
difference between read locks and write locks.
Even more usefully, if a process dies, its locks are automatically removed,
which is usually what is desired.
<!-- ???:  What about locking across NFS, flock, lockf?
XBoing doc file "problems.txt" says that lockf() works over NFS when
lockd daemon is running. -->
</para>

<para>
You can also use mandatory locks, which are based on System V's
mandatory locking scheme.
These only apply to files where the locked file's setgid bit is set, but
the group execute bit is not set.
Also, you must mount the filesystem to permit mandatory file locks.
In this case, every read(2) and write(2) is checked for locking;
while this is more thorough than advisory locks, it's also slower.
Also, mandatory locks don't port as widely to other Unix-like systems
(they're available on Linux and System V-based systems, but not necessarily
on others).
Note that processes with root privileges
can be held up by a mandatory lock, too, making it possible that
this could be the basis of a denial-of-service attack.

<title>Trust Only Trustworthy Channels</title>

<para>
In general, do not trust results from untrustworthy channels.
</para>

<para>
In most computer networks (and certainly for the Internet at large),
no unauthenticated transmission is trustworthy.
For example,
on the Internet arbitrary packets can be forged, including header values,
so don't use their values as your primary criteria for security decisions
unless you can authenticate them.
In some cases you can assert that a packet claiming to come from the
``inside'' actually does, since the local firewall would prevent such
spoofs from outside, but broken firewalls, alternative paths, and
mobile code make even this assumption suspect.
In a similar vein, do not assume that low port numbers (less than 1024)
are trustworthy; in most networks such requests can be forged or
the platform can be made to permit use of low-numbered ports.
</para>

<para>
If you're implementing a standard and inherently insecure protocol
(e.g., ftp and rlogin), provide safe defaults and document clearly
the assumptions.

<para>
The Domain Name Server (DNS) is widely used on the Internet to maintain
mappings between the names of computers and their IP (numeric) addresses.
The technique called ``reverse DNS'' eliminates some simple
spoofing attacks, and is useful for determining a host's name.
However, this technique is not trustworthy for authentication
decisions.
The problem is that, in the end, a DNS request will be sent eventually
to some remote system that may be controlled by an attacker.
Therefore, treat DNS results as an input that needs
validation and don't trust it for serious access control.
</para>

<para>
If asking for a password, try to set up trusted path (e.g.,
require pressing an unforgeable key
before login, or display unforgeable pattern such as flashing LEDs).
Otherwise, an ``evil'' program could create a display that ``looks like''
the expected display for a password (e.g., a log-in) and intercept
that password.
Unfortunately, stock Linux and most other Unixes don't
have a trusted path even for
its normal login sequence, and
since currently normal users can change the LEDs, the LEDs
can't currently be used to confirm a trusted path.
When handling a password over a network, encrypt it between trusted endpoints.
</para>

<para>
Arbitrary email (including the ``from'' value of addresses)
can be forged as well.
Using digital signatures is a method to thwart many such attacks.
A more easily thwarted approach is to require emailing back and forth
with special randomly-created values, but for low-value transactions
such as signing onto a public mailing list this is usually acceptable.
</para>

<para>
If you need a trustworthy channel over an untrusted network,
you need some sort of cryptologic
service (at the very least, a cryptologically safe hash);
see <xref linkend="crypto">
for more information on cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
</para>

<para>
Note that in any client/server model, including CGI, that the server
must assume that the client can modify any value.
For example, so-called ``hidden fields'' and cookie values can be
changed by the client before being received by CGI programs.
These cannot be trusted unless special precautions are taken.
For example, the hidden fields could be signed in a way the client
cannot forge as long as the server checks the signature.
The hidden fields could also be encrypted using a key only the trusted
server could decrypt (this latter approach is the basic idea behind the
Kerberos authentication system).
InfoSec labs has further discussion about hidden fields and applying
encryption at
<ulink url="http://www.infoseclabs.com/mschff/mschff.htm">http://www.infoseclabs.com/mschff/mschff.htm</ulink>.
In general, you're better off keeping data you care about at the server end
in a client/server model.
In the same vein,
don't depend on HTTP_REFERER for authentication in a CGI program, because
this is sent by the user's browser (not the web server).

The routines getlogin(3) and ttyname(3) return information that can be

This issue applies to data referencing other data, too.
For example, HTML or XML allow you to include by reference other files
(e.g., DTDs and style sheets) that may be stored remotely.
However, those external references could be modified so that users
see a very different document than intended;
a style sheet could be modified to ``white out'' words at critical
locations, deface its appearance, or insert new text.
External DTDs could be modified to prevent use of the document
(by adding declarations that break validation) or insert different
text into documents [St. Laurent 2000].

<title>Limit Call-outs to Valid Values</title>

<para>
Ensure that any call out to another program only permits valid
and expected values for every parameter.
This is more difficult than it sounds, because there are many
library calls or commands call lower-level routines in potentially
surprising ways.
For example, several system calls, such as popen(3) and system(3),
are implemented by calling the command shell, meaning that they will
be affected by shell metacharacters.
Similarly, execlp(3) and execvp(3) may cause the shell to be called.
Many guidelines suggest avoiding popen(3), system(3), execlp(3), and execvp(3)
entirely and use execve(3) directly in C when trying to spawn
a process [Galvin 1998b].
At the least, avoid using system(3) when you can use the execve(3);
since system(3) uses the shell to expand characters, there is more
opportunity for mischief in system(3).
In a similar manner the Perl and shell backtick (`) also call a command shell;
for more information on Perl see <xref linkend="perl">.
</para>

<para>
One of the nastiest examples of this problem are shell metacharacters.
The standard Unix-like command shell (stored in /bin/sh)
interprets a number of characters specially.
If these characters are sent to the shell, then their special interpretation
will be used unless escaped; this fact can be used to break programs.
According to the WWW Security FAQ [Stein 1999, Q37], these metacharacters are:

<screen width="61">
&amp; ; ` ' \ " | * ? ~ &#60; &#62; ^ ( ) [ ] { } $ \n \r
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Unfortunately, in real life this isn't a complete list.
Here are some other characters that can be problematic:
<!-- Martin Douda provided this list of ! through *; I added the note
     about control characters -->
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
'!' means ``not'' in an expression (as it does in C);
    if the return value of a program is tested, prepending !
    could fool a script into thinking something had failed when it
    succeeded or vice versa.
    In some shells, the "!" also accesses the command history, which can
    cause real problems.
    In bash, this only occurs for interactive mode, but tcsh
    (a csh clone found in some Linux distributions) uses "!" even in scripts.
    In csh, bash, and some other shells, if you can fool them i
    Also new bash seems to use '!' for accessing command history - but
    this probably only in interactive mode.

<listitem><para>
'-' can be misinterpreted as leading an option (or, as --, disabling
all further options).  Even if it's in the ``middle'' of a filename,
if it's preceeded by what the shell considers as whitespace you may
have a problem.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Depending on your usage, it's even conceivable that ``.''
(the ``run in current shell'') and ``='' (for setting variables) might
be worrisome characters.
However, any example I've found so far where these
are issues have other (much worse) security problems.
</para></listitem>

<!--

</itemizedlist>

</para>


<para>
Forgetting one of these characters can be disastrous, for example,
many programs omit backslash as a metacharacter [rfp 1999].
As discussed in the <xref linkend="input">, a recommended approach
by some
is to immediately escape at least all of these characters when they are input.
But again, by far and away the best approach is to identify which
characters you wish to permit, and use a filter to only permit
those characters.
</para>

<para>
A number of programs have ``escape'' codes that
perform ``extra'' activities; make sure that these can't be included
(unless you intend for them to be in the message).
For example, many line-oriented mail programs (such as mail or mailx) use
tilde (~) as an escape character, which can then be used to send a number
of commands.
As a result, apparantly-innocent commands such as
``mail admin < file-from-user'' can be used to execute arbitrary programs.
Interactive programs such as vi and emacs have ``escape'' mechanisms
that normally allow users to run arbitrary shell commands from their session.
Always examine the documentation of programs you call to search for
escape mechanisms.
</para>

<para>
The issue of avoiding
escape codes even goes down to low-level hardware components
and emulators of them.
Most modems implement the so-called ``Hayes'' command set, in which
the sequence ``+++'', a delay, and then ``+++'' again forces the modem
to switch modes (and interpret following text as commands to it).
This can be used to implement denial-of-service attacks or even forcing
a user to connect to someone else.
</para>

<para>
Many ``terminal'' interfaces implement the escape
codes of ancient, long-gone physical terminals like the VT100.
These codes can be useful, for example, for bolding characters,
changing font color, or moving to a particular location
in a terminal interface.
However, do not allow arbitrary untrusted data to be sent directly
to a terminal screen, because some of those codes can cause serious problems.
On some systems you can remap keys (e.g., so when a user presses
"Enter" or a function key it sends the command you want them to run).
On some you can even send codes to
clear the screen, display a set of commands you'd like the victim to run,
and then send that set ``back'', forcing the victim to run
the commands of the attacker's choosing without even waiting for a keystroke.
This is typically implemented using ``page-mode buffering''.
This security problem is why emulated tty's (represented as device files,
usually in /dev/) should only be writeable by
their owners and never anyone else - they should never have
``other write'' permission set, and unless only the user is a member of
the group (i.e., the ``user-private group'' scheme), the ``group write''
permission should not be set either for the terminal [Filipski 1986].
If you're displaying data to the user at a (simulated) terminal, you probably
need to filter out all control characters (characters with values less
than 32) from data sent back to
the user unless they're identified by you as safe.
Worse comes to worse, you can identify tab and newline (and maybe
carriage return) as safe, removing all the rest.
Characters with their high bits set (i.e., values greater than 127)
are in some ways trickier to handle; some old systems implement them as
if they weren't set, but simply filtering them inhibits much international
use.
In this case, you need to look at the specifics of your situation.
</para>

<para>
A related problem is that the NIL character (character 0) can have
surprising effects.
Most C and C++ functions assume
that this character marks the end of a string, but string-handling routines
in other languages (such as Perl and Ada95) can handle strings containing NIL.
Since many libraries and kernel calls use the C convention, the result
is that what is checked is not what is actually used [rfp 1999].

<para>
When calling another program or referring to a file
always specify its full path (e.g, <filename>/usr/bin/sort</filename>).
For program calls,
this will eliminate possible errors in calling the ``wrong'' command,
even if the PATH value is incorrectly set.
For other file referents, this reduces problems from ``bad'' starting
directories.

<title>Check All System Call Returns</title>

<para>
Every system call that can return an error condition must have that
error condition checked.
One reason is that nearly all system calls require limited system resources,
and users can often affect resources in a variety of ways.
Setuid/setgid programs can have limits set on them through calls such as
setrlimit(3) and nice(2).
External users of server programs and CGI scripts
may be able to cause resource exhaustion simply by making a large number
of simultaneous requests.
If the error cannot be handled gracefully, then fail open as discussed earlier.

<sect1 id="control-formatting">
<title>Control Data Formatting</title>

<para>
A number of output routines in computer languages have a
parameter that controls the generated format.
In C, the most obvious example is the printf() family of routines
(including printf(), sprintf(), snprintf(), fprintf(), and so on).
Other examples in C include syslog() (which writes system log information)
and setproctitle() (which sets the string used to display
process identifier information).
Many functions with names beginning with ``err'' or ``warn'', containing
``log'' , or ending in ``printf'' are worth considering.
<!-- log() style functions calling v* in particular -->
<!-- Some info from 7/21/2000, Theo de Raadt on Bugtraq -->
<!-- OpenBSD docs for setproctitle() is at
     http://www.rocketaware.com/man/man3/setproctitle.3.htm -->
Python includes the "%" operation, which on strings controls formatting
in a similar manner.
Many programs and libraries define formatting functions, often by
calling built-in routines and doing additional processing
(e.g., glib's g_snprintf() routine).
</para>

<para>
Surprisingly, many people seem to forget the power of these formatting
capabilities and use data from untrusted users as the formatting parameter.
Never use unfiltered data from an untrusted user as the format parameter.
Perhaps this is best shown by example:
<programlisting width="61">
  /* Wrong ways: */
  printf(string_from_untrusted_user);
  /* Right ways: */
  printf("%s %d", string_from_untrusted_user); /* or just */
  fputs(string_from_untrusted_user);
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
Otherwise, an attacker can cause all sorts of mischief by carefully
selecting the formatting string.
The case of C's printf() is a good example -
there are lots of ways to possibly exploit user-controlled format strings
in printf().
These include
buffer overruns by creating a long formatting string (this can
result in the attacker having complete control over the program),
conversion specifications that use unpassed parameters
(causing unexpected data to be inserted), and
creating formats which produce totally unanticipated result values
(say by prepending or appending awkward data,
causing problems in later use).
A particularly nasty case is printf's
%n conversion specification, which writes the
number of characters written so far into the pointer argument; 
using this, an attacker can overwrite a value that was intended for printing!
An attacker can even overwrite almost arbitrary locations, since the attacker
can specify a ``parameter'' that wasn't actually passed.
Since in many cases the results are sent back to the user,
this attack can also be used to expose internal information about the stack.
This information can then be used to circumvent stack protection systems
such as StackGuard; StackGuard uses constant ``canary'' values
to detect attacks, but if the stack's contents can be displayed,
the current value of the canary will be
exposed and made vulnerable.

     Subject: StackGuard with ... Re: [Paper] Format bugs.
-->
</para>

<para>
A formatting string should almost always be a constant string,
possibly involving a function call to implement a
lookup for internationalization (e.g., via gettext's _()).
Note that this
lookup must be limited to values that the program controls, i.e., the
user must be allowed to only select from the message files controlled
by the program.
It's possible to filter user data before using it (e.g., by designing
a filter listing legal characters for the format string such as [A-Za-z0-9]),
but it's usually better to simply prevent the problem
by using a constant format string or fputs() instead.
Note that although I've listed this as an ``output'' problem, this can
cause problems internally to a program before output
(since the output routines may be saving to a file, or even just generating
internal state such as via snprintf()).
</para>

<para>
The problem of input formatting causing security problems is
is not an idle possibility; see CERT Advisory CA-2000-13
for an example of an exploit using this weakness.
For more information on how these problems can be exploited, see
Pascal Bouchareine's email article titled ``[Paper] Format bugs'',
published in the July 18, 2000 edition of
<ulink url="http://www.securityfocus.com">Bugtraq</ulink>.
<!-- This paper can be hard to extract, but it's there -->
</para>

<!-- ???: Can internationalization lookups be controlled by an
     untrusted user?  Obviously, the language can be selected, but can the
     user supply "their own" strings? If so, that's a security hole! -->
<para>
Of course, this all begs the question as to whether or not the
internationalization lookup is, in fact, secure.
If you're creating your own internationalization lookup routines,
make sure that an untrusted user can only specify a legal locale and not
something else like an arbitrary path.
</para>

<para>
Clearly, you want to limit the strings created through internationalization
to ones you can trust.
Otherwise, an attacker could use this ability to exploit the
weaknesses in format strings, particularly in C/C++ programs.
This has been an item of discussion in Bugtraq (e.g., see
John Levon's Bugtraq post on July 26, 2000).
For more information, see the discussion on
on permitting users to only select legal language values in
<xref linkend="locale-legal-values">
</para>

<para>
Although it's really a programming bug, it's worth mentioning that
different countries notate numbers in different ways, in particular,
both the period (.) and comma (,) are used to separate an integer
from its fractional part.  If you save or load data, you need to make sure
that the active locale does not interfere with data handling.
Otherwise, a French user may not be able to exchange data with an
English user, because the data stored and retrieved will use
different separators.
I'm unaware of this being used as a security problem, but it's conceivable.

<title>C/C++</title>
<para>
One of the biggest security problems with C and C++ programs is
buffer overflow; see <xref linkend="buffer-overflow">
for more information.
C has the additional weakness of not supporting exceptions, which makes
it easy to write programs that ignore critical error situations.
</para>

<para>
<!-- The example is from Sebastian (Bugtraq, 26 June 2000) -->
One complication in C and C++ is that the character type ``char'' can be
signed or unsigned (depending on the compiler and machine).
When a signed char with its high bit set
is saved in an integer, the result will be a negative number;
in some cases this can be exploitable.
In general, use ``unsigned char'' instead of char or signed char for
buffers, pointers, and casts when
dealing with character data that may have values greater than 127 (0x7f).
</para>

<para>
C and C++ are by definition very lax in their type-checking support, but
there's no need to be lax in your code.
Turn on as many compiler warnings as you can and change the code to cleanly
compile with them, and strictly use ANSI prototypes in separate header
(.h) files to ensure that all function calls use the correct types.
For C or C++ compilations using gcc, use at least
the following as compilation flags (which turn on a host of warning messages)
and try to eliminate all warnings (note that -O2 is used since some
warnings can only be detected by the data flow analysis performed at
higher optimization levels):
<screen width="61">
gcc -Wall -Wpointer-arith -Wstrict-prototypes -O2
</screen>
You might want ``-W -pedantic'' too.
</para>

<para>
Many C/C++ compilers can detect inaccurate format strings.
For example,
gcc can warn about inaccurate format strings for functions you create
if you use its __attribute__() facility (a C extension) to mark such functions,
and you can use that facility without making your code non-portable.
Here is an example of what you'd put in your header (.h) file:
<programlisting width="61">
 /* in header.h */
 #ifndef __GNUC__
 #  define __attribute__(x) /*nothing*/
 #endif

 extern void logprintf(const char *format, ...)
    __attribute__((format(printf,1,2)));
 extern void logprintva(const char *format, va_list args)
    __attribute__((format(printf,1,0)));
</programlisting>
The "format" attribute takes either "printf" or "scanf", and the numbers
that follow are the parameter number of the format string and the first
variadic parameter (respectively). The GNU docs talk about this well.
Note that there are other __attribute__ facilities as well,
such as "noreturn" and "const".

<sect1 id="perl">
<title>Perl</title>
<para>
Perl programmers should first read the man page perlsec(1), 
which describes a number of issues involved with writing secure programs
in Perl.
In particular, perlsec(1) describes the ``taint'' mode, which most
secure Perl programs should use.
Taint mode is automatically enabled if the real and effective user or group
IDs differ, or you can use the -T command line flag
(use the latter if you're running on behalf of someone else, e.g.,
a CGI script).
Taint mode turns on various checks, such as checking
path directories to make sure they aren't writable by others.
</para>

<para>
The most obvious affect of taint mode, however, is that
you may not use data derived from outside your program to
affect something else outside your program by accident.
In taint mode,
all externally-obtained input is marked as ``tainted'', including
command line arguments, environment variables,
locale information (see perllocale(1)),
results of certain system calls (readdir, readlink,
the gecos field of getpw* calls), and all file input.
Tainted data may not be
used directly or indirectly in any command that invokes a
sub-shell, nor in any command that modifies files,
directories, or processes.
There is one important exception: If you
pass a list of arguments to either system or exec, the
elements of that list are NOT checked for taintedness, so
be especially careful with system or exec while in taint mode.
</para>

<para>
Any data value derived from tainted data becomes tainted also.
There is one exception to this; the way to untaint data is to
extract a substring of the tainted data.
Don't just use ``.*'' blindly as your substring, though, since this
would defeat the tainting mechanism's protections.
Instead, identify patterns that identify the ``safe'' pattern
allowed by your program, and use them to extract ``good'' values.
After extracting the value, you may still need to check it
(in particular for its length).
</para>

<para>
The open, glob, and backtick functions
call the shell to expand filename wild card characters; this
can be used to open security holes.
You can try to avoid these functions entirely, or use them in a
less-privileged ``sandbox'' as described in perlsec(1).
In particular, backticks should be rewritten using the system() call
(or even better, changed entirely to something safer).
</para>

<para>
The perl open() function comes with, frankly, 
``way too much magic'' for most secure programs; it interprets text
that, if not carefully filtered, can create lots of security problems.
Before writing code to open or lock a file, consult the perlopentut(1)
man page.
In most cases, sysopen() provides a safer (though more convoluted)
approach to opening a file.
<ulink
url="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2000-03/msg02596.html">
The new Perl 5.6 adds an open() call
with 3 parameters to turn off the magic behavior
without requiring the convolutions of sysopen()</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
Perl programs should turn on the warning flag (-w), which warns of
potentially dangerous or obsolete statements.
</para>

<para>
You can also run Perl programs in a restricted environment.
For more information see the ``Safe'' module in the standard Perl
distribution.
I'm uncertain of the amount of auditing that this has undergone,
so beware of depending on this for security.

<para>
As with any language,
beware of any functions which allow data to be executed as parts of
a program, to make sure an untrusted user can't affect their input.
This includes exec(), eval(), and execfile()
(and frankly, you should check carefully any call to compile()).
The input() statement is also surprisingly dangerous.

<para>
Python programs with privileges that can be invoked by unprivileged users
(e.g., setuid/setgid programs)
must <emphasis>not</emphasis> import the ``user'' module.
The user module causes the pythonrc.py file to be read and executed.
Since this file would be under the control of an untrusted user,
importing the user module allows an attacker to force the trusted
program to run arbitrary code.
</para>

<para>
Python includes support for ``Restricted Execution'' through
its RExec class.
This is primarily intended for executing applets and mobile code, but
it can also be used to limit privilege in a program even when the
code has not been provided externally.
By default, a restricted execution
environment permits reading (but not writing) of files,
and does not include operations for network access or GUI interaction.
These defaults can be changed, but beware of creating loopholes in
the restricted environment.
In particular, allowing a user to unrestrictedly add attributes to a
class permits all sorts of ways to subvert the environment
because Python's implementation calls many ``hidden'' methods.
Note that, by default, most Python objects are passed by reference; if you
insert a reference to a mutable value into a restricted program's environment,
the restricted program can change the object in a way that's visible
outside the restricted environment!
Thus, if you want to give access to a mutable value, in many cases
you should copy the mutable value or use the Bastion module (which supports
restricted access to another object).
For more information, see
Kuchling [2000].
I'm uncertain of the amount of auditing that the restricted
execution capability has undergone, so programmer beware.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="shell">
<title>Shell Scripting Languages (sh and csh Derivatives)</title>
<para>
I strongly recommend against using
standard command shell scripting languages (such as csh, sh, and bash)
for setuid/setgid secure code.
Some systems (such as Linux) completely disable them, so you're
creating an unnecessary portability problem.
On some old systems they are fundamentally insecure due to a race condition
(as discussed in <xref linkend="process-creation">).
Even for other systems, they're not really a good idea.
Standard command shells are still notorious for being affected by
nonobvious inputs -
generally because command shells were designed to try to do
things ``automatically'' for an interactive user, not to defend against
a determined attacker.
For example,
``hidden'' environment variables (e.g., the ENV or BASH_ENV variable)
can affect how they operate or even execute arbitrary user-defined
code before the script can even execute.
Even things like filenames of the executable or directory contents can
affect things.
For example, on many Bourne shell implementations, doing the following
will grant root access (thanks to NCSA for describing this
exploit):
<!-- http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Grid/ACES/security/programming/#setuid-sh-exploit -->
<programlisting width="61">
 % ln -s /usr/bin/setuid-shell /tmp/-x
 % cd /tmp
 % -x
</programlisting>
Some systems may have closed this hole, but the point still stands:
most command shells aren't intended for writing secure setuid/setgid programs.
For programming purposes, avoid creating setuid shell scripts, even
on those systems that permit them.
Instead, write a small program in another language to clean up the
environment, then have it call other executables (some of which
might be shell scripts).
</para>

If you still insist on using shell scripting languages, at least
put the script in a directory where it cannot be moved or changed.

If you're developing secure programs using Java,
frankly your first step (after learning Java)
is to read the two primary texts for Java security, namely
Gong [1999]
and
McGraw [1999] (for the latter, look particularly at section 7.1).
You should also look at Sun's posted security code guidelines at
<ulink url="http://java.sun.com/security/seccodeguide.html">http://java.sun.com/security/seccodeguide.html</ulink>.
A set of slides describing Java's security model are freely available at
<ulink url="http://www.dwheeler.com/javasec">http://www.dwheeler.com/javasec</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
The following are a few key guidelines, based on Gong [1999],
McGraw [1999], and Sun's guidance:

<orderedlist>

<listitem><para>
Do not use public fields or variables; declare them as private and
provide accessors to them so you can limit their accessibility.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Make methods private unless these is a good reason to do otherwise
(and if you do otherwise, document why).
These non-private methods must protect themselves, because they may
receive tainted data (unless you've somehow arranged to protect them).
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Avoid using static field variables. Such variables are attached to the
class (not class instances), and classes can be located by any other class.
As a result, static field variables can be found by any other class, making
them much more difficult to secure.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Never return a mutable object to potentially malicious code
(since the code may decide to change it).
Note that arrays are mutable (even if the array contents aren't),
so don't return a reference to an internal array with sensitive data.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Never store user given mutable objects (including arrays of objects)
directly.
Otherwise, the user could hand the object to the secure code, let the
secure code ``check'' the object, and change the data while the secure code
was trying to use the data.
Clone arrays before saving them internally, and be careful here
(e.g., beware of user-written cloning routines).
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Don't depend on initialization.
There are several ways to allocate uninitialized objects.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Make everything final, unless there's a good reason not to.
If a class or method is non-final, an attacker could try to extend it
in a dangerous and unforeseen way.
Note that this causes a loss of extensibility, in exchange for security.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Don't depend on package scope for security.
A few classes, such as java.lang, are closed by default, and some
Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) let you close off other packages.
Otherwise, Java classes are not closed.
Thus, an attacker could introduce a new class inside your package,
and use this new class to access the things you thought you were protecting.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Don't use inner classes.
When inner classes are translated into byte codes, the inner class
is translated into a class accesible to any class in the package.
Even worse, the enclosing class's private fields silently
become non-private to permit access by the inner class!
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Minimize privileges.
Where possible, don't require any special permissions at all.
McGraw goes further and recommends not signing any code; I say
go ahead and sign the code (so users can decide to ``run only
signed code by this list of senders''), but try to write the program
so that it needs nothing more than the sandbox set of privileges.
If you must have more privileges, audit that code especially hard.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
If you must sign your code, put it all in one archive file.
Here it's best to quote McGraw [1999]:
<blockquote>
<para>
The goal of this rule is to prevent
an attacker from carrying out a mix-and-match
attack in which the attacker constructs a new applet
or library that links some of your signed classes together
with malicious classes, or links together signed classes that you
never meant to be used together.
By signing a group of classes together, you make this attack more difficult.
Existing code-signing systems do an inadequate job of
preventing mix-and-match attacks, so this rule cannot
prevent such attacks completely. But using a single archive can't hurt.
</para>
</blockquote>
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Make your classes uncloneable.
Java's object-cloning mechanism allows an attacker to
instantiate a class without running any of its constructors.
To make your class uncloneable, just define the following method
in each of your classes:
<programlisting width="71">
<![CDATA[
public final void clone() throws java.lang.CloneNotSupportedException {
   throw new java.lang.CloneNotSupportedException();
   }
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
If you really need to make your class cloneable, then there are some
protective measures you can take to prevent attackers from redefining
your clone method.
If you're defining your own clone method, just make it final.
If you're not, you can at least prevent the clone method from 
being maliciously overridden by adding the following:
<programlisting width="71">
<![CDATA[
public final void clone() throws java.lang.CloneNotSupportedException {
  super.clone();
  }
]]>
</programlisting>
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Make your classes unserializeable.
Serialization allows attackers to view the internal state of your objects,
even private portions.
To prevent this, add this method to your classes:
<programlisting width="66">
<![CDATA[
private final void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream out)
  throws java.io.IOException {
     throw new java.io.IOException("Object cannot be serialized");
  }
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
Even in cases where serialization is okay, be sure to use
the transient keyword for the fields
that contain direct handles to system resources and
that contain information relative to an address space. 
Otherwise, deserializing the class may permit improper access.
You may also want to identify sensitive information as transient.
</para>

<para>
If you define your own serializing method for a class,
it should not pass an internal array to any DataInput/DataOuput
method that takes an array.
The rationale: All DataInput/DataOutput methods can be overridden.
If a Serializable class passes a private array directly to a DataOutput(write(byte [] b)) method, then an attacker
could subclass ObjectOutputStream and override the write(byte [] b)
method to enable him to access and modify the private array. 
Note that the default serialization does not expose private
byte array fields to DataInput/DataOutput byte array methods.

Make your classes undeserializeable.
Even if your class is not serializeable, it may still be deserializeable.
An attacker can create a sequence of bytes that happens
to deserialize to an instance of your class with values of the
attacker's choosing.
In other words, deserialization is a kind of public constructor, allowing
an attacker to choose the object's state - clearly a dangerous operation!
To prevent this, add this method to your classes:
<programlisting width="66">
<![CDATA[
private final void readObject(ObjectInputStream in)
  throws java.io.IOException {
    throw new java.io.IOException("Class cannot be deserialized");
  }
]]>
</programlisting>
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Don't compare classes by name.
After all, attackers can define classes with identical names, and if
you're not careful you can cause confusion by granting these classes
undesirable privileges.
Thus, here's an example of the <emphasis>wrong</emphasis> way
to determine if an object has a given class:
<programlisting width="65">
<![CDATA[
  if (obj.getClass().getName().equals("Foo")) {
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
If you need to determine if two objects have exactly the
same class, instead
use getClass() on both sides and compare using the == operator, 
Thus, you should use this form:
<programlisting width="65">
<![CDATA[
  if (a.getClass() == b.getClass()) {
]]>
</programlisting>
If you truly need to determine if an object has a given classname, you
need to be pedantic and be sure to use the current namespace
(of the current class's ClassLoader).
Thus, you'll need to use this format:
<programlisting width="65">
<![CDATA[
  if (obj.getClass() == this.getClassLoader().loadClass("Foo")) {
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
This guideline is from McGraw and Felten, and it's a good guideline.
I'll add that, where possible, it's often a good idea to avoid comparing
class values anyway.
It's often better to try to design class methods and interfaces so you
don't need to do this at all.
However, this isn't always practical, so it's important to know these tricks.

<title>TCL</title>
<para>
Tcl stands for ``tool command language'' and is pronounced ``tickle.''
TCL is divided into two parts: a language and a library.
The language is a simple text language, intended for issuing commands
to interactive programs and including basic programming capabilities.
The library can be embedded in application programs. 
</para>

<para>
You can find more information about TCL at sites such as the
<ulink url="http://www.sco.com/Technology/tcl/Tcl.html">TCL WWW Info</ulink>
web page.
Probably of most interest are Safe-TCL (which creates a sandbox in TCL)
and Safe-TK (which implements a sandboxed portable GUI for Safe-TCL), as
well as the WebWiseTclTk Toolkit permits TCL packages to be automatically
located and loaded from anywhere on the World Wide Web.
You can find more about the latter from
<ulink url="http://www.cbl.ncsu.edu/software/WebWiseTclTk">http://www.cbl.ncsu.edu/software/WebWiseTclTk</ulink>.
It's not clear to me how much code review this has received.
More useful information is available from the comp.lang.tcl FAQ launch
page at
<ulink url="http://www.tclfaq.wservice.com/tcl-faq">http://www.tclfaq.wservice.com/tcl-faq</ulink>.
However, it's worth noting that TCL's desire to be a small, ``simple''
language results in a language that can be rather limiting;
see
<ulink url="http://sdg.lcs.mit.edu/~jchapin/6853-FT97/Papers/stallman-tcl.html">
Richard Stallman's ``Why You Should Not Use TCL''</ulink>.
For example, TCL's notion that there is essentially
only one data type (string) can
make many programs harder to write (as well as making them slow).
Also, when I've written TCL programs
I've found that it's easy to accidentally create TCL programs where
malicious input strings can cause untoward and unexpected behavior.
For example, an attackers may be able to cause your TCL program
to do unexpected things by sending characters with special meaning to TCL
such as embedded spaces, double-quote, curly braces,
dollar signs, or brackets (or create input
to cause these characters to be created during processing).
Thus, I don't recommend TCL for writing programs which must
mediate a security boundary.
If you do choose to do so, be especially careful to ensure that user
input cannot ``fool'' the program.
On the other hand, I know of no strong reason (other than
insufficient review) that TCL programs can't be used to implement mobile code.
There are certainly TCL advocates who will advocate more use than I do,
and TCL is one of the few languages with
a ready-made sandbox implementation.

<title>Passwords</title>

<para>
Where possible, don't write code to handle passwords.
In particular, if the application is local,
try to depend on the normal login authentication by a user.
If the application is a CGI script, try to depend on the web server to provide
the protection.
If the application is over a network, avoid sending the password as cleartext
(where possible) since it can
be easily captured by network sniffers and reused later.
``Encrypting'' a password using some key fixed in the algorithm or using
some sort of shrouding algorithm is essentially the same as sending the
password as cleartext.
</para>

<!-- ???: Show _HOW_ to use PAM to do simple password checking; the PAM
     docs are complex on this score.  Also show how to ``fall through''
     if you don't have PAM? -->

<para>
For networks, consider at least using digest passwords.
Digest passwords are passwords developed from hashes; typically the
server will send the client some data (e.g., date, time, name of server),
the client combines this data with the user password, the client hashes
this value (termed the ``digest pasword'')
and replies just the hashed result to the server;
the server verifies this hash value.
This works, because the password is never actually sent in any form; the
password is just used to derive the hash value.
Digest passwords aren't considered ``encryption'' in
the usual sense and are usually accepted even in countries with laws
constraining encryption for confidentiality.
Digest passwords are vulnerable to active attack threats but
protect against passive network sniffers.
One weakness is that, for digest passwords
to work, the server must have all the unhashed passwords, making the server
a very tempting target for attack.
</para>

<para>
If your application permits users to set their passwords, check
the passwords and permit only ``good'' passwords
(e.g., not in a dictionary, having certain minimal length, etc.).
You may want to look at information such as
<ulink
url="http://consult.cern.ch/writeup/security/security_3.html">http://consult.cern.ch/writeup/security/security_3.html</ulink>
on how to choose a good password.
You should use PAM if you can, because it supports pluggable password checkers.

<sect1 id="random-numbers">
<title>Random Numbers</title>

<para>
``Random'' numbers generated by many library routines are intended to be
used for simulations, games, and so on; they are
<emphasis remap="it">not</emphasis> sufficiently random for use in security functions such
as key generation.
The problem is that these library routines use algorithms whose future
values can be easily deduced by an attacker (though they may appear random).
For security functions, you need random values based on truly unpredictable
values such as quantum effects.
</para>

<para>
Failing to correctly generate truly random values for keys has caused
a number of problems, including holes in Kerberos,
the X window system, and NFS [Venema 1996].
</para>

<para>
The Linux kernel (since 1.3.30) includes a random number generator, which
is sufficient for many security purposes.
This random number generator  gathers  environmental  noise
from  device  drivers  and  other  sources into an entropy pool.
When accessed as /dev/random, random bytes are only returned
within the estimated number of bits of noise in the entropy pool
(when the entropy pool is empty, the call blocks until additional
environmental noise is gathered).
When accessed as /dev/urandom, as many bytes as are requested are
returned even when the entropy pool is exhausted.
If you are using the random values for cryptographic purposes (e.g.,
to generate a key), use /dev/random.
More information is available in the system documentation random(4).
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="protect-secrets">
<title>Specially Protect Secrets (Passwords and Keys) in User Memory</title>
<para>
If your application must handle passwords or non-public keys
(such as session keys, private keys, or secret keys), overwrite them
immediately after using them so they have minimal exposure.
For example,
in Java, don't use the type String to store a password because Strings are
immutable (they will not be overwritten until garbage-collected and
reused, possibly a far time in the future).
Instead, in Java use char[] to store a password, so it can be
immediately overwritten.
</para>

<para>
Also,
if your program handles such secret values, be sure to disable creating
core dumps (via ulimit).  Otherwise, an attacker may be able to halt the
program and find the secret value in the data dump.
Also, beware - normally processes can monitor other processes through
the calls for debuggers (e.g., via ptrace(2) and the /proc pseudo-filesystem)
[Venema 1996]
Kernels usually protect against these monitoring routines if the process is
setuid or setgid
(on the few ancient ones that don't, there really isn't a way to
defend yourself other than upgrading).
Thus, if your process manages secret values, you probably should make it
setgid or setuid (to a different unprivileged group or user) to forceably
inhibit this kind of monitoring.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="crypto">
<title>Cryptographic Algorithms and Protocols</title>

<para>
Often cryptographic algorithms and protocols are necessary to keep
a system secure, particularly when communicating through an untrusted
network such as the Internet.
Where possible, use session encryption to foil session hijacking and
to hide authentication information, as well as to support privacy.
</para>

<para>
For background information and code, you should probably look at
the classic text ``Applied Cryptography'' [Schneier 1996].
Linux-specific resources include the Linux Encryption HOWTO at
<ulink
url="http://marc.mutz.com/Encryption-HOWTO/">http://marc.mutz.com/Encryption-HOWTO/</ulink>.
A discussion on how protocols use the basic algorithms can be
found in [Opplinger 1998].
What follows here is just a few comments; these areas are rather
specialized and covered more thoroughly elsewhere.
</para>

<para>
It's worth noting that there are many legal hurdles involved with
cryptographic algorithms.
First, the use, export, and/or import of implementations of
encryption algorithms are restricted in many countries.
Second, a number of algorithms are patented; even if the owners permit
``free use'' at the moment, without a signed contract they can always
change their minds later.
Most of the patent issues can be easily avoided nowadays, once you know
to watch out for it, so there's little reason to subject yourself to
the problem.
</para>

<para>
Cryptographic protocols and algorithms are difficult to get right,
so do not create your own.
Instead, use existing protocols and algorithms where you can.
In particular, do not create your own encryption algorithms unless you are
an expert in cryptology, know what you're doing, and plan to spend
years in professional review of the algorithm.
Creating encryption algorithms (that are any good)
is a task for experts only.
</para>

<para>
For protocols, try to use standard-conforming protocols
such as SSL (soon to be TLS), SSH, IPSec, GnuPG/PGP, and Kerberos.
Many of these overlap somewhat in functionality, but each has
a ``specialty'' niche.
SSL (soon to be TLS) is the primary method for protecting http (web)
transactions.
PGP-compatible protocols (implemented in PGP and GnuPG) are a primary
method for securing email end-to-end.
Kerberos is a primary method for securing and supporting authentication
on a LAN.
SSH is the primary method of securing ``remote terminals'' over an 
internet, e.g., telnet-like and X windows connections, though it's often
used for securing other data streams too (such as CVS accesses).
IPSec is the primary method for security lower-level packets and
``all'' packets, so it's particularly useful for securing
virtual private networks and remote machines.
</para>

<para>
For secret key (bulk data) encryption algorithms,
use only encryption algorithms that have been openly published and withstood
years of attack, and check on their patent status.
For encrypting unimportant data, the old DES (56-bit key) algorithm still
has some value, but with modern hardware it's too easy to break.
For many applications triple-DES is currently the best encryption algorithm; it
has a reasonably lengthy key (112 bits), no patent issues, and has
a long history of withstanding attacks.
The upcoming AES algorithm may be worth using as well, once it's proven.
You should probably avoid IDEA due to patent issues
(it's subject to U.S. and European patents), but I'm unaware of any serious
technical problems with it.
Your protocol should support multiple algorithms;
that way, when an algorithm is broken, users can switch to another one.
</para>

<para>
For public key cryptography (used, among other things, for
authentication and sending secret keys), there are only a few
widely-deployed algorithms.
One of the most widely-used algorithms is RSA;
RSA's algorithm is patented, but only in the U.S., and that patent
expires September 20, 2000.
The Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm is widely used to permit
two parties to agree on a session key.  By itself it doesn't guarantee that
the parties are who they say they are, or that there is no middleman, but
it does strongly help defend against passive listeners; its patent
expired in 1997.
NIST developed the digital signature standard (DSS) (it's a
modification of the ElGamal cryptosystem) for digital signature
generation and verification; one of the conditions for its development
was for it to be patent-free.
</para>

<para>
Some programs need a one-way hash algorithm, that is, a function
that takes an ``arbitrary'' amount of data and generates a fixed-length
number that hard to invert (e.g., it's difficult for an attacker to
create a different set of data to generate that same value).
For a number of years MD5 has been a favorite, but recent efforts have
shown that its 128-bit length may not be enough
[van Oorschot 1994]
and that certain attacks weaken MD5' protection
[Dobbertin 1996].
Indeed, there are rumors
that a top industry cryptographer has broken MD5, but is bound by
employee agreement to keep silent
(see the Bugtraq 22 August 2000 posting by John Viega).
If you're writing new code, you probably ought to use SHA-1 instead.
</para>

<para>
In a related note, if you must create your own communication
protocol, examine the problems of what's gone on before.
Classics such as Bellovin [1989]'s review of security problems
in the TCP/IP protocol suite might help you, as well as
Bruce Schneier [1998]
and Mudge's breaking of Microsoft's PPTP implementation and their
follow-on work.
Of course, be sure to give any new protocol widespread review, and
reuse what you can.

<sect1 id="use-pam">
<title>PAM</title>

<para>
Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) is
a flexible mechanism for authenticating users.
Many Unix-like systems support PAM, including
Solaris, nearly all Linux distributions
(e.g., Red Hat Linux, Caldera, and Debian as of version 2.2),
and FreeBSD as of version 3.1.
By using PAM, your program can be independent of the
authentication scheme (passwords, SmartCards, etc.).
Basically, your program calls PAM, which at run-time determines
which ``authentication modules'' are required by checking the configuration
set by the local system administrator.
If you're writing a program that requires authentication (e.g., entering
a password), you should include support for PAM.

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
ITS4 from Reliable Software Technologies (RST)
statically checks C/C++ code.
ITS4 works by performing
pattern-matching on source code, looking for patterns known to be
possibly dangerous (e.g., certain function calls).
It is available free for non-commercial use, including its source code
and with certain modification and redistribution rights.
One warning; the tool's licensing claims can be initially misleading.
RST claims that ITS4 is ``open source'' but, in fact, its license
does not meet the
<ulink url="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html">Open
Source Definition</ulink> (OSD).
In particular, ITS4's license fails point 6, which forbids
``non-commercial use only'' clauses in open source licenses.
It's unfortunate that RST insists on using the term
``open source'' to describe their license.
ITS4 is a fine tool, released under a
fairly generous license for commercial software, yet
using the term this way can give the appearance of a company
trying to gain the cachet of ``open source'' without actually
being open source.
RST says that they simply don't accept the OSD definition and
that they wish to use a different definition instead.
Nothing legally prevents this, but the OSD definition is used by
over 5000 software projects (at least all those hosted by SourceForge
at http://www.sourceforge.net),
Linux distributors, Netscape (now AOL), the W3C,
journalists (such as those of the Economist),
and many other organizations.
Most programmers don't want to wade through license agreements,
so using this other definition can be confusing.
I do not believe RST has any intention to mislead; they're
a reputable company with very reputable and honest people.
It's unfortunate that this particular position of theirs
leads (in my opinion) to unnecessary confusion.
In any case, ITS4 is available at

</sect1>

<sect1 id="miscellaneous">
<title>Miscellaneous</title>

<para>
The following are miscellaneous security guidelines that I couldn't
seem to fit anywhere else:
</para>

<para>
Have your program check at least some of its assumptions before it uses them
(e.g., at the beginning of the program).
For example, if you depend on the ``sticky'' bit being set on a given
directory, test it; such tests take little time and could prevent
a serious problem.
If you worry about the execution time of some tests on each call, at least
perform the test at installation time, or even better at least
perform the test on application start-up.
</para>

<para>
Write audit logs for program startup, session startup, and
for suspicious activity.
Possible information of value includes date, time, uid, euid, gid, egid,
terminal information, process id, and command line values.
You may find the function syslog(3) helpful for implementing audit logs.
One awkward problem is that any logging system should be able to record
a lot of information (since this information could be very helpful), yet
if the information isn't handled carefully the information itself could be
used to create an attack.
After all, the attacker controls some of the input being sent to the program.
When recording data sent by a possible attacker,
identify a list of ``expected'' characters and
escape any ``unexpected'' characters so that the log isn't corrupted.
Not doing this can be a real problem; users may include characters
such as control characters (especially NIL or end-of-line) that
can cause real problems.
For example, if an attacker embeds a newline, they can then forge
log entries by following the newline with the desired log entry.
Sadly, there doesn't seem to be standard convention for escaping these
characters.
I'm partial to the URL escaping mechanism
(%hh where hh is the hexadecimal value of the escaped byte) but there
are others including the C convention (\ooo for the octal value and \X
where X is a special symbol, e.g., \n for newline).
There's also the caret-system (^I is control-I), though that doesn't
handle byte values over 127 gracefully.
</para>

<para>
There is the danger that a user could create a denial-of-service attack
(or at least stop auditing)
by performing a very large number of events that cut an audit record until
the system runs out of resources to store the records.
One approach to counter to this threat is to rate-limit audit record
recording; intentionally slow down the response rate
if ``too many'' audit records are being cut.
You could try to slow the response rate only to the suspected attacker,
but in many
situations a single attacker can masquerade as potentially many users.
</para>

<para>
Selecting what is ``suspicious activity'' is, of course, dependent on
what the program does and its anticipated use.
Any input that fails the filtering checks discussed earlier is
certainly a candidate (e.g., containing NIL).
Inputs that could not result from normal use should probably be logged,
e.g., a CGI program where certain required fields are missing
in suspicious ways.
Any input with phrases like /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow
or the like is very suspicious in many cases.
Similarly, trying to access Windows ``registry'' files or .pwl files
is very suspicious.
</para>

<para>
If you have a built-in scripting language, it may be possible for the
language to set an environment variable which adversely affects the
program invoking the script.
Defend against this.
</para>

<para>
If you need a complex configuration language,
make sure the language has a comment
character and include a number of commented-out secure examples.
Often '&num;' is used for commenting, meaning ``the rest
of this line is a comment''.
</para>

<para>
If possible, don't create setuid or setgid root programs;
make the user log in as root instead.
</para>

<para>
Sign your code. That way, others can check to see if what's available
was what was sent.
</para>

<para>
Consider statically linking secure programs.
This counters attacks on the dynamic link library mechanism
by making sure that the secure programs don't use it.
</para>

<para>
When reading over code, consider all the cases where a match is not made.
For example, if there is a switch statement, what happens when none of the
cases match?
If there is an ``if'' statement, what happens when the condition is false?

Designing and implementing a truly secure program
is actually a difficult task on Unix-like systems such as Linux and Unix.
The difficulty is that a truly secure program must respond
appropriately to all possible inputs and environments
controlled by a potentially hostile user.
Developers of secure programs must deeply understand their platform,
seek and use guidelines (such as these), and then use assurance
processes (such as peer review) to reduce their programs' vulnerabilities.

The first two points primarily protect me from repeatedly hearing about
obsolete bugs.
I do not want to hear about bugs I fixed a year ago, just because you
are not properly mirroring the document.
By linking to the master site,
users can check and see if your mirror is up-to-date.
I'm sensitive to the problems of sites which have very
strong security requirements and therefore cannot risk normal
connections to the Internet; if that describes your situation,
at least try to meet the other points
and try to occasionally sneakernet updates into your environment.

By this license, you may modify the document,
but you can't claim that what you didn't write is yours (i.e., plagerism)
nor can you pretend that a modified version is identical to
the original work.
Modifying the work does not transfer copyright of the entire work to you;
this is not a ``public domain'' work in terms of copyright law.
See the license in <xref linkend="fdl"> for details.
If you have questions about what the license allows, please contact me.
In most cases, it's better if you send your changes to the master
integrator (currently David A. Wheeler), so that your changes will be
integrated with everyone else's changes into the master copy.

	  The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
	  written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
	  the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
	  modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily,
	  this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
	  credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
	  modifications made by others.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	  This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
	  works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
	  complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
	  license designed for free software.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	  We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
	  software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
	  program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
	  software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
	  can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
	  whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
	  principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

	<para id="fdl-secondary">
	  A <link linkend="fdl-secondary">"Secondary Section"</link> is a named

	  related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within

	  mathematics, a <link linkend="fdl-secondary">Secondary Section</link>
	  may not explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter
