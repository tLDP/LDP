<Sect1 id="intro">
<Title>Introduction</Title>

<Para>
 One of the most annoying problems many of us are faced with is the
 poor default fonts and font settings of X as implemented by many
 distributions. I'm talking specifically about <Ulink
 url="http://www.xfree.org">XFree86</Ulink>, other versions of X may be
 better. Many programs use fixed width default fonts when a variable width
 font would be more appropriate. Other programs use fonts that are
 so small as to be practically unreadable. The fonts that are bundled with
 XFree86 are not of the same quality as found on some other platforms. XFree86
 does come with a halfway decent courier font, but its Times and Helvetica
 fonts are simple bitmap fonts that pixelize when they are scaled. 
 This is changing for the better recently, but a default Linux desktop 
 still often needs some tweaking to get the best fonts possible. 

</Para>

<Para>
 This HOWTO attempts to show how to adjust various font settings, install new
 fonts, and do other things that should greatly improve the appearance and
 readability of fonts on the X Window Desktop. This is done by adjusting the
 <Literal>FontPath</Literal> in the <FileName>XF86Config</FileName> file, by
 adding switches to X server command line in <Command>startx</Command> or
 <Command>xdm</Command> (and variants), by adding new fonts, and by installing
 a TrueType font server and fonts. TrueType does indeed make a huge
 difference. 

</Para>


<Para>
 Comments, corrections, additions and critiques are always welcome. You can
 reach the author at <email>hal@foobox.net</email>. Contributions are also
 welcomed. Especially anyone who really stays current with KDE and/or Gnome
 issues!

<Title>Conventions Used in this Document</Title>

<Para>
 <ItemizedList>

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    Where examples of commands are used, a <quote>#</quote> character is used to
    denote where typically the command would be run as the root user. A
    <quote>$</quote> is used where typically a non-root user would be executing
    the command.
   </Para>
  </ListItem>
 
  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    The examples use <FileName>/usr/local/share/fonts/ttfonts</FileName> as our
    TrueType font directory. There is no magic to this location, and could
    conceivably just as well be in any number of other locations. Some 
    distros may have a default location for TrueType fonts, and you may 
    want to use that instead.
   </Para>
  </ListItem>
 
  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    References to "xfs" are to the xfs as packaged by Redhat for versions 6.x
    and later. This differs significantly in some respects from the stock
    XFree86 xfs. 
   </Para>
  </ListItem>
 
  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    References to "Netscape" are to the entire suite of programs from Netscape:
    Communicator, Navigator, Messenger, etc. And for all intents and purposes,
    font configuration in Mozilla is very similar.
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    'XF86Config' is the X configuration file. For Redhat based distros, as of 
    Redhat 7.0, this is now 'XF86Config-4' for XFree86 4.x. For the most 
    part, we'll just use 'XF86Config' here.
   
   </Para>
  
   <Para>
    Also, while some aspects of XFree86 4.x configuration are the same as
    3.3.x, there are some significant differences. We'll only highlight the
    differences. So unless noted otherwise, any comments or examples will
    apply to both 3.3.x and 4.x versions.
 
   </Para>
  </ListItem>
  
  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    File system layout varies somewhat from distribution to distribution. It 
    is impossible to stay on top of every conceivable variation of who keeps 
    which files where. So take the examples here with a grain of salt if the 
    PATHs don't seem to match your system.

 better.

<Sect2>
<Title>Setting The FontPath</Title>

<Para>
 The first place to look for curing font problems is the
 <FileName>XF86Config</FileName> file.
 <FileName>/usr/X11/lib/X11/XF86Config</FileName> or
 <FileName>/etc/X11/XF86Config</FileName> are the common locations. (This may
 be <FileName>XF86Config-4</FileName> for XFree86 4.x.) If you haven't
 guessed already, the most important part of this file relating to fonts is
 the <Literal>FontPath.</Literal> Before we get into that, this would be a
 good time to check the other parts of your X configuration. Bad monitor
 settings can be even more of a headache than bad fonts, so make sure your
 refresh rate is as high as your monitor can handle (85 Hz is great, 75 Hz is
 OK, 60 Hz is painful.)                                      

</Para>


<Para>
 Use your favorite text editor and edit 
 <FileName>XF86Config</FileName>.  Near the top of the file in the
 "Files" section, you should see something vaguely like this:                 
 </Para>

<BlockQuote>
<Para>
 <Literal>
  <MSGText>
   <LiteralLayout>
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/"
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/"
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/"
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/"
   </LiteralLayout>
  </MSGText>
 </Literal>
</Para>
</BlockQuote>

<Para>
 This much should be the same, or at least similar, for both XFree86 3.x and
 4.x. The <Literal>FontPath</Literal> tells X where to find the fonts it uses
 to render text on your display.  Order is important -- when an X application
 asks X to render some text, the X server usually has some leeway to choose the
 font that is used.  The X server then goes through the
 <Literal>FontPath</Literal> and grabs the first font it sees that matches the
 X client's criteria, and then displays. (Note that Redhat's xfs for versions 6.x
 and later has a different way of setting the <Literal>FontPath</Literal>. See
 the <xref LinkEnd="xfs"> below for more on xfs.)

</Para>

<Para>
 If the 100dpi fonts are not listed, they probably did not get installed for 
 whatever reason, so you may want install them now. Default installations
 may put 75dpi fonts before the 100dpi fonts. If you have a high
 resolution display (1024x768 or higher), this means very tiny fonts. If this
 is the case, the first tweak you'll use is to switch the 75dpi and 100dpi
 FontPath lines:
</Para>

<BlockQuote>
 <Para>
  <Literal>
   <MSGText>
    <LiteralLayout>
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/"
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/"
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/"
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/"
    </LiteralLayout>
   </MSGText>
  </Literal>
 </Para>
</BlockQuote>

<Para>
 Next, specify that you prefer to use unscaled bitmap fonts.  If you've ever
 used Netscape or any other program that displays titles using big fonts,
 you'll likely notice that those fonts are pixelized.  This is ugly and needs
 to be corrected.  So add <Literal>:unscaled</Literal> to the ends of the misc,
 100dpi and 75dpi fonts. You can even use both unscaled and scaled fonts if
 you want, just put the unscaled <Literal>FontPath</Literal> lines first to
 tell X you prefer unscaled fonts if possible:
</Para>

<BlockQuote>
 <Para>
  <Literal>
   <MSGText>
    <LiteralLayout>

 After making these changes, restart X. Doesn't the desktop look better

<Title>X Server Command Line Options</Title>

<Para>
 The next thing you need to do is adjust the command line options for the X
 server. You'll want to use the <Literal>-dpi</Literal> switch which specifies
 the display resolution in dots per inch.  As a lot of systems use high
 resolution displays these days, chances are they'll be working at 100
 dpi.

 If you start X from the console command prompt, type:
</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>
 $ startx -dpi 100 -depth 16
 </Literal>
</Para>

<Para>
 Or these options can be stored in <Filename>~/.xserverrc</FileName>. See the 
 <Command>startx</Command> and <Command>xinit</Command> man pages for more on
 this. 
</Para>

<Para>
 If you use xdm (or friends such as gdm) for graphical logins, you'll want to
 edit your <FileName>/usr/X11/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers</FileName> file (or
 possibly <FileName>/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers</FileName>) which will have the
 command line for the Xserver in it.  Mine has the line:

<Para>
 Note that there is no magic to <Quote>-dpi 100</Quote>. Choose something
 higher if your hardware will support it -- like <Quote>-dpi 120</Quote>.

<Sect1 id="TrueType">
<Title >TrueType Fonts (One of the few things Windows is good for)
</Title>

<Para>
 Because the boys at Redmond are very concerned with the appearance of their
 software (as opposed to the internal workings ;) they built TrueType font
 support into Windows.  And of course no big surprise, but they got the idea
 from Apple. In fact, TrueType is a registered trademark of Apple Computer,
 Inc. Windows 9x and nearly every other incarnation of Windows comes with
 Arial, Times New Roman, and Courier New, which are roughly equivalent to
 Helvetica, Times and Courier. TrueType fonts are scalable, so they look good
 in large sizes, and they are well hinted, so they are readable at small
 sizes.  Many windows applications come with dozens more TrueType fonts.
 Don't microwave your Windows CD yet, you'll want to get those fonts first!
</Para>

<Para>
 Unfortunately, XFree86 3.x does not come with built in TrueType support, so
 you'll have to add it yourself (see below). This will mean installing a font
 server that does support TrueType and, of course, installing the fonts
 themselves. XFree86 4.x does have built in support however (see <Xref
 LinkEnd="x-4x">). You won't find many decent TrueType fonts included with any
 distribution. The likely reason is that there are not many quality TrueType
 fonts available under a suitable license at this time. 

</Para>

<Sect2>
<Title>Making TrueType Fonts Available</Title>

<Para>
 Let's start with the fonts first. Any TrueType font included with the various
 MS Windows incarnations should work. Don't forget word processors and other
 apps that may include their own fonts. MacOS fonts will only work if 
 converted to a usable format. (See the <Link LinkEnd="links">links
 section</Link> for converter packages.) There are also some 'free' TrueType
 fonts available for download if you have already nuked that CD (see <Link
 LinkEnd="links">links section</Link>).
</Para>

<Para>
 In order to use TrueType, the fonts will have to be always accessible to the
 font server. This means they will have to be on a filesystem that is
 <Emphasis>always</Emphasis> mounted. This can conceivably be a Windows
 partition on a dual boot system. Alternately, the fonts can be copied to
 Linux.  First <Command>su</Command> to root: 
</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>
  <MSGText>
   <LiteralLayout>
 # su -
 # mkdir -p /usr/local/share/fonts/ttfonts
   </LiteralLayout>
  </MSGText>
 </Literal>
</Para>

<Para>
 Now, change to the new font directory:
</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>
  <MSGText>
   <LiteralLayout>
  # cd  /usr/local/share/fonts/ttfonts
   </LiteralLayout>
  </MSGText>
 </Literal>
</Para>


<Para>
 Then, add the fonts to this directory, either by copying them from your
 Windows system:
</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>
  <MSGText>
   <LiteralLayout>
 # cp /mnt/&lt;path_to_fonts&gt;/*ttf  .
   </LiteralLayout>
  </MSGText>
 </Literal>
</Para>

<Para>
 or by downloading those available directly from Microsoft: 
 <Ulink URL="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fontpack/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fontpack/default.htm</Ulink>.
 These fonts are in self-extracting zip archives. The ones labeled for use
 with Windows 3.1 can indeed be unpacked under Linux with the Linux
 <Command>zip</Command> utility:
</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>
  <MSGText>
   <LiteralLayout>
 # ls *exe | xargs -n 1 unzip -L
   </LiteralLayout>
  </MSGText>
 </Literal>
</Para>

<Para>
 The '-L' option will convert to lower case font names (this may be necessary for
 some versions of xfsft and Redhat's xfs). Note that the current Linux zip
 utility does not work with the 32 bit Win9x cab font archives. (It also looks
 like Microsoft no longer has the 16 bit Arial, Courier and Times-Roman on
 this site.) But these can be unarchived under Linux with 
 <Command>cabextract</Command>, which can be found 
 <Ulink
 URL="http://www.kyz.uklinux.net/cabextract.php3">http://www.kyz.uklinux.net/cabextract.php3</Ulink>.
 This would now seem to be the best way to go since there is a better
 selection of fonts.
</Para> 

<Para>
 A slick solution to this from Sebastiano Vigna is his 
 <Ulink URL=" http://freshmeat.net/webFonts4Linux ">
 http://freshmeat.net/webFonts4Linux</Ulink>, which automates 
 the downloading, extracting and installation of the Microsoft fonts 
 all in one neat package.
</Para>
 
<Para> 
 Or you can get an RPM of WebFonts that contains some of the MS 'Web' 
 TrueTypes from <Ulink
 URL="ftp://ftp.rpmfind.net/linux/contrib/noarch/noarch/webfonts-1-3.noarch.rpm">ftp://ftp.rpmfind.net/linux/contrib/noarch/noarch/webfonts-1-3.noarch.rpm</Ulink>.
 This has enough basic fonts to keep Netscape and other web browsers happy. 
 Something similar for Debian is <Ulink
 URL="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/msttcorefonts.html">http://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/msttcorefonts.html</Ulink>.
 This does not include the actual fonts, but facilitates the installation.
</Para>


<Para>
 You will also have to include the new TrueType directory(s) in the X server's 
 fontpath. So with your text editor of choice add the line(s) as appropriate:

<Sect2>
<Title>Font Servers</Title>

<Para>
 There are several font servers available that will do the job: xfstt, xfsft,
 and Redhat's patched version of xfs based on xfsft. While these names are all
 too similar, these are different packages.  One, or more, of these should be
 included with any recent Linux distribution, and you may have one installed
 already.  

</Para>

<Para>
 Historically, font servers were used to serve fonts over a network. Font 
 resources could then reside on one host, and clients could access them as 
 needed. But, the developers have enhanced these to include features such as 
 the ability to render TrueType fonts. (XFree86 4.x has this ability included
 already, and thus an additional font server is not really needed solely
 for the purpose of having TrueType support.)

</Para>





<!--   ~~~~~       New Section      ~~~~~     -->

<Sect4>
<Title>Installation</Title>

<Para>
 xfstt is <emphasis>very</emphasis> easy to install and configure.  If it isn't

<Title>Redhat's xfs</Title>

<Para>
 As of Redhat Linux 6.0, Redhat based distributions (Mandrake, etc) have
 included a specially patched version of xfs, the XFree86 Font Server, and
 patched X servers as well. Redhat's xfs includes the xfsft patch set which in
 turn is built upon the FreeType Font library. Redhat's xfs provides similar
 functionality to xfstt. xfs is able to serve both TrueType and Type 1 fonts,
 as well as legacy X fonts. 
</Para>

<Para>
 If you are using a Redhat based distro, you should have xfs installed
 already. If not, it is in the <FileName>XFree86-xfs*rpm</FileName>. To make
 sure it runs as one of the default services, either use
 <Command>ntsysv</Command> or:

<Title>Setting the xfs FontPath</Title>

<Para>
 The default Redhat installation of xfs serves fonts via a Unix Domain Socket.
 We'll need to tell the X server where to look for xfs, and thus fonts. The
 FontPath in <FileName>/etc/X11/XF86Config</FileName> must include for Redhat 
 6.x:
</Para>

<BlockQuote>
 <Para>
  <Literal>
   <MSGText>
    <LiteralLayout>
 FontPath   "unix/:-1" 
    </LiteralLayout>

<Para>
 This is changed for Redhat 7.x to:
 
</Para>


<BlockQuote>
 <Para>
  <Literal>

    <LiteralLayout>
 FontPath   "unix/:7100" 
    </LiteralLayout>
   </MSGText>
  </Literal>
 </Para>
</BlockQuote>



<Para>
 At least for a default configurations. This is a reference to the socket where
 xfs is listening. You may include additional FontPaths, but these will be
 handled by the X server, and not xfs.  A clean install of Redhat 6/7 should
 have this already set up, but if you are upgrading from an older version, you
 may have to change this yourself!  

</Para>

<Para>
 xfs then has its own, separate FontPath stored in
 <FileName>/etc/X11/fs/config</FileName>. This is where it will look to find
 fonts. This is over and above the X server's FontPath in
 <FileName>XF86Config</FileName>. You can either add the new path(s) with a text
 editor, or use the <Command>chkfontpath</Command> command: 

</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>
 # chkfontpath --add /new/font/path
 </Literal>
</Para>

<Para>
 The FontPath must exist before running <Command>chkfontpath</Command>. The

<Title>Getting the Fonts Ready</Title>

<Para>
 We still have a bit of work to do before we can actually use any TrueType
 fonts. xfs requires a few things to be in order. First, all font files must

<Para>
 Note the punctuation -- the backquotes are important! Remove any spaces from
 font names too. Once the TrueType fonts are properly installed, you must 
 create both <FileName>fonts.dir</FileName> and
 <FileName>fonts.scale</FileName> files. The following commands do this: 

</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>

   <LiteralLayout>
 # ttmkfdir -o fonts.scale
 # mkfontdir

 You should now have <FileName>fonts.dir</FileName> and 
 <FileName>fonts.scale</FileName> files in your TrueType font
 directory. <Command>ttmkfdir</Command> is in the 
 <FileName>Freetype</FileName> RPM, and must be run 
 before <Command>mkfontdir</Command>. With Debian based distros, there  
 is a similar utility called <Command>mkttfdir</Command>, and is in the 
 <Filename>fttools</FileName> Deb package. Though this apparently does not 
 generate as many encodings as <Command>ttmkfdir</Command>. These commands
 may not always report errors, so verify that they were created and are not
 empty files:

   </LiteralLayout>
  </MSGText>
 </Literal>
</Para>


<Para>
 If you encounter any problems, try <Command>ttmkfdir</Command> with the 
 <Command>- m</Command> switch. This will discard bad characters from the 
 font file. Specify a number such as 50 or l00 
 (<Command>ttmkfdir -m 50</Command>).  The files themselves are text files.

<Title>xfsft</Title>

<Para>
 <Ulink url="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/jec/programs/xfsft/">xfsft</Ulink>
 is a TrueType solution from Juliusz Chroboczek. xfsft is based on the 
 FreeType font library as developed by Mark Leisher and others. It is 
 essentially is a patch for XFree86's xfs and related libraries -- xfs + ft.
 Redhat's xfs is essentially xfsft with a few minor modifications. Also,
 XFree86 4.x includes the <Literal>freetype</Literal> font module which is also
 the result of Juliusz's work, and is one of the TrueType solutions available
 for XFree86 4.x.

</Para>

<Para>
 Building xfsft requires having at least some of the XFree86 source available, 
 in addition to xfsft itself, so this is not for the faint of heart.
 Instructions for building and configuring xfsft are in the tarball, so I won't 
 go into details here. They are pretty straight forward. There are links to 
 binaries available at the xfsft home page (see above).
</Para>

<Para>
 Note that you <emphasis>must</emphasis> also create
 <FileName>fonts.scale</FileName> and <FileName>fonts.dir</FileName> files for
 xfsft. <FileName>fonts.scale</FileName> can be created manually (ugh!), or with
 the <Command>ttmkfdir</Command> utility. This is not included with xfsft but
 you can get it here:  <ulink
 url="http://www.joerg-pommnitz.de/TrueType/ttmkfdir.tar.gz">http://www.joerg-pommnitz.de/TrueType/ttmkfdir.tar.gz</ulink>,
 or probably on many Linux archives sites too. Redhat has this as part of the
 <FileName>Freetype</FileName> RPM. And for Debian it is called
 <Command>mkttfdir </Command> and is in the <Filename>fttools</FileName>
 package.


</Para>

<Para>
 You will also need a configuration file. Here is a sample:

</Para>

<BlockQuote>

<Title>The fonts.alias File</Title>

<Para>
 <FileName>fonts.alias</FileName> is yet another font configuration file that 
 can be used to tweak how fonts are handled. Like <FileName>fonts.scale</FileName> 
 and <FileName>fonts.dir</FileName>, <FileName>fonts.alias</FileName> must be in
 the same directory as the fonts you are aliasing. It is not mandatory however,
 but does solve certain potential problems.Here is an example from the first
 line of<FileName>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/fonts.alias</FileName> on 
 a Redhat system:
</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>

   </LiteralLayout> 
  </MSGText>
 </Literal>
</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>fixed</Literal> is the 'alias' here. Any time this is requested, we 
 actually get the font definition from the second column. Font too small? Just 
 change the definition. (Warning: this is a critical file, at least on Redhat.)
 The same principle applies to all fonts, including TrueType. In fact, if you 
 don't have TrueType, you could conceivably use this trick to have a
 comparable Type 1, or other, font aliased as a TrueType.
</Para>

<Para>
 <FileName>fonts.alias</FileName> is important for some applications that don't
 handle the data provided by <FileName>fonts.scale</FileName> well. Most notably 
 here is Netscape. Without a <FileName>fonts.alias</FileName> you will find that 
 Netscape will only show point sizes of 0 and 12 available.
 <FileName>fonts.alias</FileName> fixes this. You might also find that if you a 
 specify another size with the <Literal>scalable font</Literal> option under 
 <Literal>Preferences</Literal>, Netscape will not remember this setting.
 Annoying! This is also fixed. So we really need this file. Sample excerpt from
 a <FileName>fonts.scale</FileName>:

 (<emphasis>Please note that I have split each line for readability</emphasis>.
 There should be two columns all on one line, without the <Quote>\</Quote>, and
 separated by at least one space.) This will keep Netscape happy. Also, if
 font names should have embedded spaces, then you should enclose the filename
 in quotes. You might also note the <Literal>pointsize</Literal> discrepancy
 between the first and second columns of the first few rows. The first column
 of the first entry has a '6', whereas this is aliased to a '9' in the second
 column, and thus '9' point. This is by design and is an excellent way to
 overcome the Netscape 'damn tiny fonts' syndrome. Adjust to suit your tastes,
 resolution, and eyesight.

 This file can be created manually with a text editor, or conceivably with some 
 fancy sed or awk scripting. There is an excellent discussion of this file,
 and other font related topics at Kristin Aanestad's site  at 
 <Ulink url="http://home.c2i.net/dark/linux.html#ttf">http://home.c2i.net/dark/linux.html</Ulink>. There is
 also a link to a python script which can reportedly automatically generate
 a <Filename>fonts.alias</FileName> file at this same site. Thanks to Kristin
 whose work and insight was the inspiration for this section!

</Para>

<Para>
 Note that with XFree86 4.0.2 and greater, there are new font handling 
 mechanisms available via the Xft extensions. Font aliasing is done 
 in Xft's own configuration file: <Filename>XftConfig</FileName>. This 
 is the preferred method where anti-aliasing, and the other new rendering 
 features are desired. See the <Link LinkEnd="AA">Anti-aliasing Section</Link> 
 for more on this. This is only true where the application itself supports the
 new extensions! At this time, not many do yet.

<Title>XFree86 4.x</Title>

<Para>
 <Ulink url="http://www.xfree86.org/4.0/">XFree86 4.0</Ulink> 
 introduced native support for TrueType fonts, along with other new
 features. The enhanced font support is based on xfsft from Juliusz
 Chroboczek, which in turn is based on the FreeType font library originally
 from Mark Leisher, so the configuration is similar to xfsft and Redhat's
 patched xfs. As of 4.0.2, XFree86 begins to support anti-aliasing which is 
 a technique for smoothing font outlines (see section below).

</Para>

<Para>
 The <Literal>FontPath</Literal> is still in <FileName>XF86Config</FileName>, as 
 always. For Redhat 6/7 using a stock XFree86 4.x (i.e. NOT the Redhat 7.x
 supplied version), this will mean moving the Redhat xfs
 <Literal>FontPath</Literal> from <FileName>/etc/X11/fs/config</FileName> back
 to <FileName>XF86Config</FileName>. A separate font server is no longer
 needed just for TrueType support. You may disable it, unless it is needed to
 serve fonts to other clients in a network environment. See the section below 
 for Redhat 7.x specific configuration issues.

<Title>Anti-aliasing</Title>

<Para>
 Anti-aliasing is a technique for producing even smoother, crisper looking fonts
 by subtly softening the sharp, jagged edges. This has long been a feature of
 Apple and Microsoft font rendering, and is now making it's way into X via the
 X Rendering Extension specification thanks to Keith Packard. The new
 extensions provide other benefits as well. This is still a bit 
 experimental at this time (June 2001). Distributions that support
 anti-aliasing with their stable/official versions are now being released.
</Para>

<Para>
 That is the good news. The bad news is that not all drivers support
 anti-aliasing yet. This is a moving target, so you will have to dig around to
 find whether your chipset is supported or not. The recently released 4.1
 should have near universal support. More not-so-good news is that few 
 applications are actually taking advantage of this yet. We will have 
 to wait for the various toolkits (TK, GTK, etc) to catch up.
</Para>

<Para>
 If you are reading this long after the publication date (June 2001),
 hopefully most of these shortcomings will have been overcome. All hardware will
 eventually be supported, mainstream distros will have shipped releases that 
 include the new extensions, and they will be enabled by default. Many apps
 will look better since they will be <Quote>AA</Quote> aware, and we won't
 have to jump through any configuration hoops just to make it work. In the
 meantime, read on ...

 Newer distro releases are likely to have the foundation support for

 cutting edge, and may be more palatable for some than building
 each package from source.

<Para>
 The rendering engine that provides the advanced rendering features is 
 configured with the <Filename>XftConfig</FileName> file. This would typically 
 be installed as <Filename>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XftConfig</FileName>. This 
 file provides Font Path information, etc., and is a requirement over and 
 above <Filename>XF86Config</FileName>. If your PATH to your TrueType or Type1
 fonts is different, be sure to modify as needed. And of course, you need to
 have XFree86 configured for TrueType support (see the above section).

 Xft is an interface to the freetype rasterizer written by Keith Packard,
 member of the XFree86 Project, Inc. It allows applications to use fonts from
 the new X render extension using a unified font naming scheme. In
 <Filename>/etc/X11/XftConfig</FileName> (or
 <Filename>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XftConfig</FileName>) you will find a
 configuration file which can be adapted to suit your personal taste. In this

<Title>XftConfig Structure</Title>

<Para>
 The basic structure revolves around a 'pattern'. A pattern is a set of
 name/valuelist pairs, each valuelist contains one or more typed values. A
 certain application requests a font, for example:
</Para>

 <Para>
  <Literal>
   <MSGText>
    <LiteralLayout>
 family: "Arial"
 size: 12
 encoding: "iso8859-1"
    </LiteralLayout>
   </MSGText>
  </Literal>
 </Para>

<Para>
 A size 12 arial font in latin-1 encoding. The Xft extension will now try to
 patch this pattern to all of the fonts available in the system. And
 selecting the one with the best score. Before the matching is done Xft looks
 in <Filename>XftConfig</FileName>. The requested pattern can here be extended
 before use. An example is: 
</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>
  <MSGText>
   <LiteralLayout>
 match any family == "Arial" edit antialias = true;
   </LiteralLayout>
  </MSGText>
 </Literal>
</Para>

<Para>
 This will enable anti-aliasing for all fonts of the family Arial.
</Para>

<Para>
 Also, the X server is queried to list all of its fonts; the XLFD contains
 just enough information to match fonts roughly.

  <Para>
   List your Type 1 and TrueType font directories with <Quote>dir</Quote>. On my

<ListItem>
 <Para>
  How do I make aliases for my fonts?
 </Para>

 <Para>
  I noted that my KDE console asks for <Quote>mono</Quote> fonts when it is
  looking for a fixed font. <Quote>console</Quote> is used when I select
  <Quote>linux</Quote> in the font menu of the KDE konsole. Therefore, I used
  two aliases for fonts which are also named <Quote>fixed</Quote>:
 </Para>

 <Para>
  <Literal>
   <MSGText>
    <LiteralLayout>
 match any family == "fixed"     edit family =+ "mono";
 match any family == "console"   edit family =+ "mono";

  </Literal>
 </Para>
 </ListItem>

<ListItem>
 <Para>
  Anti-aliasing my fonts makes me dizzy!
 </Para>

 <Para>
  Although there is a big fuzz around AA in X, good fonts actually look better
  if they are not anti-aliased. The anti-aliasing blurs the fonts by adding
  gray pixels to the edges, and this may strain your eyes if you looking at
  them for a long time. (Your eyes will try to get the fonts sharper, which
  of course is not working because they are blurred;) However, for very small
  fonts, anti-aliasing may increase the readability of the fonts, because with
  sharp edges, there are to little pixels available for your mind to figure
  out what it means. And for bigger fonts, the edges become very jagged when
  not anti-aliased, so here you also might want to have aliased fonts. Of course
  you can also turn off the anti-aliasing for specific fonts. In other
  operating systems, most truetype fonts are not anti-aliased between 8 and 12
  pixels, while only large Type1 fonts are anti-aliased.
 </Para>

 <Para>
  Use the following in your <Filename>XftConfig</FileName> to anti-alias only
  fonts of specific sizes:
 </Para>

 <Para>
  <Literal>
   <MSGText>
    <LiteralLayout>
 match 
       any size > 8 
       any size < 15

       antialias = false;

  </Literal>
 </Para>
</ListItem>

<ListItem>
 <Para>
  My fixed fonts do not appear or look _very_ wrong in the KDE konsole or
  similar programs!
 </Para>

 <Para> 
  I noted that somehow a lot of fixed font do not tell Xft that they are
  fixed, and thus, mono spaced. Therefore only a part of the font is
  displayed. We can manually set the spacing for these fonts (this assumes you
  have fixed aliased with mono as in question 3 above:
 </Para>

 <Para>
  <Literal>
   <MSGText>
    <LiteralLayout>
 match 
       any family == "mono" 
 edit 
       spacing = mono;
    </LiteralLayout>
   </MSGText>
  </Literal>
 </Para>
</ListItem>

<ListItem>
 <Para>
  My Symbol, Webdings, etc. fonts do not show up!
 </Para>

 <Para>
  For some reason some (symbol) fonts are not correctly recognized, and Xft
  will show your default font, or a font which has the closest match (which
  is generally not what you mean at all). For Adobe Symbol and MS-webdings I
  did the following to get them working:
 </Para>

 <Para>
  <Literal>
   <MSGText>
    <LiteralLayout>
 match 
       any family == "webdings" 
 edit 
       antialias = false;
       encoding += "glyphs-fontspecific";


 match 
       any family == "symbol" 
 edit 
       antialias = false;
       encoding += "glyphs-fontspecific";
    </LiteralLayout>
   </MSGText>
  </Literal>
 </Para>

 <Para>
  A useful way of figuring out these things is to activate debugging with:
 </Para>

 <Para>
  <Literal>
   <MSGText>
    <LiteralLayout>
 export XFT_DEBUG=1024
    </LiteralLayout>
   </MSGText>
  </Literal>
 </Para>

 <Para>
  This will generate a lot of output, especially if you have many fonts,
  because it lists the properties and scores of every font available. You can
  also use other values. For a nice summary of what happens (requested font,
  XftConfig substitutions, x server additions and the finally matched font),
  you can use XFT_DEBUG=2.
 </Para>
</ListItem>

<ListItem>
 <Para>
  Why do my KDE programs start now soooo slooow?
 </Para>

 <Para>
  The Xft mechanism in XFree prior to 4.1 had to parse the
  <Filename>XftConfig</FileName> file each time a program was started. And the
  info of all these fonts had to be re-read. As of X 4.1.0, a cache is used
  and starting applications using Xft is much faster. Especially if you have
  many fonts this can be very useful. So, upgrading XFree86, and related
  packages, is a good idea. 
 </Para>
</ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para> 
   I have a LCD screen, can I use subpixel hinting instead of normal
   anti-aliasing?
  </Para>
  <Para>
   Yes you can. Subpixel hinting uses colors instead of gray pixels to do the
   AA. I do not have a LCD screen so I do not have any idea of how it looks
   but you can play with the rgba setting. Try:
 </Para>

 <Para>
  <Literal>
   <MSGText>
    <LiteralLayout>
 match edit rgba=bgr;
    </LiteralLayout>
   </MSGText>
  </Literal>
 </Para>

  <Para>
   or use rgb if you have a different type of monitor. For vertical AA you can
   try vbgr and vbgr.
  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para> 
   My fonts still look bad!
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   If you do not have some good truetype fonts, it is worth to go and look for
   them on the Internet. Other reasons why your fonts still look bad can be
   because of your build of freetype2. Snapshots versions before 2.0.2 were
   compiled with an option that had some patent issues. Therefore, the
   standard 2.0.2 and 2.0.3 compiles without this option. To fix this,
   download the freetype2 source rpm and change in
   include/freetype/config/ftoption.h line 314:
  </Para>

 You've gone through all the steps, and verified that the
 <Quote>RENDER</Quote> extension is available, but you don't perceive a
 difference? Well, maybe the applications themselves just aren't there yet,

 So how to know what does and does not make use of anti-aliasing? A quick test
 is to use something like xmag, or gimp, and enlarge the text considerably.
 Look for diagonal lines, and if they are clearly stair-stepped with no
 softened edges. If so, then while anti-aliasing is technically available, it
 is not being used. With anti-aliasing you should see gradients instead of
 well defined sharp edges. You can compare this with xterm and

<Para>
 KDE is one of the best things that have happened to Linux and X in a
 long time.  It provides a consistent user interface that goes a long
 way towards making Linux accessible to the average non-geek.  More
 information about KDE can be found at
 <Ulink URL="http://www.kde.org/">http://www.kde.org/</ULink>. So why am
 I singing it's praises here?  This is because KDE 1.1 has a new feature
 that will make the fonts and colors in your programs, including non-KDE
 applications consistent with KDE's current style.

<Title>Applying KDE Fonts and Colors to non-KDE Applications</Title>

 This is very easy.  Simply start up the KDE Control Center, go to
 Desktop, and go to Style inside Desktop.  In there, there will be a
 toggle switch labeled "Apply fonts and colors to non-KDE apps".  Turn it
 on, click OK, and your done!  The next time you start up many X
 applications, they will use the same colors and fonts that your KDE
 applications do.  Some people may like this feature better than others,
 but if you don't like it you can always turn it off.

<Sect2>
<Title>Netscape</Title>

<Para>
 Let's face it, Netscape is an important application in Linux. We all use it,
 and we all need it, so let's look at it specifically for a minute. An out of
 the box Netscape installation is prone to the font problems we've discussed --
 large fonts that get pixelized, splotchy looking fonts, fonts so small they
 are unreadable. In short, ugly. Maybe this is why you are here?

</Para>

<Para>
 Hopefully, at this point you have followed the above suggestions. These steps
 can help greatly. TrueType font availability is almost a necessity, and you
 need a TrueType font server for this. Many web pages specify font families --
 like Arial -- that are not typically available to Linux users. This is bad
 design, but having some of the basic TrueType fonts available will help
 greatly in overcoming the short-sightedness of some designers. Microsoft --
 can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em.

</Para>

<Para>
 Assuming you have TrueType working, from the Netscape menu select
 <Literal>Edit -> Preferences -> Fonts</Literal>.  Open the <Literal>Variable
 Width Font</Literal> droplist on the right side of the window. Your TrueTypes
 should be there along with other fonts. Choose which ever one suits your fancy
 as the default. Check the <Literal>Allow Scaling</Literal> checkbox too. If
 the available point sizes are 0 and 12, you can go down and, and enter your
 desired point size in the box to the right and click on the
 <Literal>OK</Literal> button. The down-side to this is that Netscape will not
 remember these settings, and you will have to do this each time you start
 Netscape. <Emphasis>Unless</Emphasis> -- you have
 <FileName>fonts.alias</FileName> set up already.  Then this will solve these
 problems. See <Xref LinkEnd="falias"> for more on <FileName>fonts.alias</FileName>.

</Para>

<Para>
 You might consider experimenting with some <FileName>~/.Xdefaults</FileName> (or 
 perhaps it's<FileName>~/.Xresources</FileName> on your system) settings too:
</Para>

<BlockQuote>
 <Para>
  <Literal>
   <MSGText>
    <LiteralLayout>
 Netscape*DocumentFonts.sizeIncrement: 10
 Netscape*documentFonts.xResolution*iso-8859-1: 120
 Netscape*documentFonts.yResolution*iso-8859-1: 120
    </LiteralLayout>
   </MSGText>
  </Literal>
 </Para>
</BlockQuote>

<Para>
 The 'sizeIncrement' controls how much of a jump Netscape makes when different
 'basefont' sizes are specified ala:

</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>
 &lt;basefont size=7&gt;
 </Literal>
</Para>

<Para>
 for instance. The default is '20', which is a pretty good jump. Changing this
 can help Netscape from scaling to too large and too small of a font. The x and
 y resolutions are roughly equivalent to 'dpi' settings. Any random number
 within reason can be used here. Experiment. 

</Para>

<Para>
 Then run: 
</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>
 $ xrdb -load ~/.Xdefaults
 </Literal>
</Para>

<Para>
 (or <FileName>.Xresources</FileName> as the case may be) and restart Netscape.
 There are many settings that can be tweaked or altered this way. Look at the
 <FileName>Netscape.ad</FileName> (app defaults) file that should be included
 with Netscape packages.
</Para>

<Para>
 If this approach does not get the job done as far as the 'tiny fonts' problem
 in Netscape, then see the <Filename>fonts.alias</FileName> section above. You
 can really fine tune many things with this approach. 

</Para>

<Para>
 Mozilla configuration should be roughly the same. You might find, however,
 that Mozilla does a better job of handling fonts in X, and pages will look
 better overall.

   Unfortunately there is no unified font handling system for Linux. You will have
