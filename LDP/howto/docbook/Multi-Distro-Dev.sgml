  <sect1 id="Introduction"> <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>As a developer, there is occasionally a need to code and/or
    test programs on multiple Linux distributions.  This mini-howto
    outlines a neat <application>chroot</application> trick that can,
    in many cases, obviate the need to reboot into different Linux
    distributions to do testing or development. </para>

    <para>In a nutshell, the "trick" is to place all the files from a
    particular linux distribution into a single directory and then
    <application>chroot</application> into that directory to
    develop/test/debug your program.  This approach will work provided
    that:
    </para>
    
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
The kernel version of the "main" or "primary" distribution that you
are running is (at least somewhat) compatible with the "secondary" or
<application>chroot</application>'ed distributions, and
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
Your application is primarily user-space (ie. no kernel modules) and
does not depend intimately on any particular kernel features
(ie. <filename>/proc</filename> behavior).
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

  <sect1 id="Setup"> <title>Setup</title>

    <para>We assume that you already have:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
One "main" or "primary" Linux distribution installed that is running a
2.4-series or newer kernel,
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
a free partition with 2--4Gigs available, and
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
sufficient disk 
    space for the secondary installs (and any subsequent
    development/testing work).
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>Given those assumptions, the following outline is one way to
    setup the multiple secondary Linux distributions that will be used
    for development, testing, or other purposes:
    </para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
First, create or locate an unused partition on one of your hard drives
that is large enough (usually 2--4Gb is sufficient) to do a basic
install of one of the secondary Linux distributions.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
Install the secondary distro into this partition but do not add it to
your boot configuration.  Note that this install need only include the
packages that your target application (or tests) require.  For
instance, you may be able to ignore applications such as the X server
or other space-hogs.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
Reboot your primary Linux distribution and mount the partition
containing the freshly-installed "secondary" distro.  Copy (preferably
using <filename>tar -cp</filename> or some other method that preserves
permissions) all the files from the secondary distro to a location
such as <filename>/opt/distros/DISTRO_NAME</filename>.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
Repeat steps 2--3 for any additional distributions that you wish to
install.  The result should be a directory structure resembling:
	</para>
<programlisting>
/opt/distros/redhat_6.2/
             suse_7.2/
             mandrake_8.1/
             debian-potato/
             slackware_8.0/</programlisting>
	<para>
where each directory contains the complete set of files resulting from
each distribution install.  </para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="Use"> <title>Using the Secondary Distributions</title>

    <para>With the secondary distributions installed, the steps to use
    them are: </para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
It is important to use a 2.4-series or newer Linux kernel in the
"primary" Linux distribution in order to take advantage of the
multiple mount points feature that the 2.4-series permits.  For many
tasks, the <filename>/proc</filename> and <filename>/tmp</filename>
filesystems will have to be remounted in the secondary distribution
using:
<programlisting>
mount --bind /proc /opt/distros/redhat_6.2/proc
mount --bind /tmp /opt/distros/redhat_6.2/tmp</programlisting>
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
Also, it can be helpful to remount (rather than copy) the source tree
from the primary to the secondary distro:
<programlisting>
mount --bind /home/USER/src/PROJECT /opt/distros/redhat_6.2/USER/src/PROJECT</programlisting>
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
Become root and use:
<programlisting>
xhost +localhost chroot /opt/distros/redhat_6.2
/bin/bash</programlisting> to obtain a shell with one of the secondary
distros.  Note that the <filename>xhost</filename> command is only
necessary if you intend to use X-windows applications.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
Finally, create a user (if necessary) within the
<filename>chroot</filename>-ed shell and develop, build, and/or test
your application within this "separate" Linux distribution!  Not that
you may also have to specify your <filename>DISPLAY</filename>
environment variable if you'd like to use X applications.
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>Done!  You now have a shell that is, for all practical
    purposes, running within the secondary Linux distribution of your
    choice. </para>

    <para>The ideas contained in this mini-HOWTO are not originally
    mine.  They are culled from posts by Ben Reed (of <ulink
    url="http://www.opennms.org/"> OpenNMS </ulink>) to one of the
    <ulink url="http://www.trilug.org/"> TriLUG </ulink> mailing
    lists.  I found the information to be so useful that I wanted to
    document the idea for others. </para>
