        This document describes how to acquire, install and configure a 
        powerful scientific public-domain Geographic Information System (GIS): 
        the Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS).  It provides 
        information on other resources for learning more about GRASS, GIS in 
        general, for acquiring data, etc.

    <title>What is a GIS?</title>
  
    <para>
      There are many ways to describe a Geographic Information System.  Here 
      are three working definitions (from David A. Hastings, 1992, Geographic 
      Information Systems: A Tool for Geoscience Analysis and Interpretation):
    </para>

    <orderedlist numeration="Arabic">
      <listitem>
        <para>
          (The minimal definition):  A GIS is a hardware/software system 
          for the storage, management, and (with hardcopy or screen 
          graphic) selective retrieval capabilities of georeferenced data.  
          Definitions like this one are often used by vendors and users of 
          vector-only GIS, whose objective is sophisticated management and 
          output of cartographic data.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          (A parallel definition): A GIS is a hardware/software system for 
          managing and displaying spatial data.  It is similar to a 
          traditional Data Base Management System, where we now think in 
          <emphasis>spatial</emphasis> rather than in tabular terms, and where the 
          "report writer" now allows output of maps as well as of tables 
          and numbers.  Thus we can consider a GIS a "spatial DBMS" as 
          opposed to traditional "tabular DBMSs."  Few people use this 
          definition, but it might help to explain GIS to a DBMS user.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
        <para>
          (A more aggressive definition): A GIS is a system of hardware, 
          software, and data that facilitates the development, 
          enhancement, modeling, and display of multivariate (e.g. 
          multilayered) spatially referenced data.  It performs some 
          analytical functions itself, and by its analysis, selective 
          retrieval and display capabilities, helps the user to further 
          analyze and interpret the data.  Properly configured, the GIS 
          can model (e.g. synthetically recreate) a feature or phenomenon 
          as a function of other features or phenomena which may be 
          related - where all features or phenomena are represented 
          (characterized) by spatial and related tabular data.  The 
          analytical objectives described here are sometimes controversial 
          - and often given lip service by cartographic GIS specialists 
          who have not yet seen what can be accomplished scientifically by 
          a select few GISs that go beyond cartographic approaches.

    <title>What Is GRASS?</title>
  
    <para>
      GRASS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System) is a public domain 
      raster based GIS, vector GIS, image processing system, and graphics 
      production system.  Created by the US Army Corps of Engineers, 
      Constriction Engineering Research Laboratory (USA/CERL) and enhanced by 
      many others, it is used extensively at government offices, universities 
      and commercial organizations throughout the world. It is written mostly 
      in C for various UNIX based machines.  Linux is one of its more robust 
      implementations.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      GRASS contains over 40 programs to render images on monitor and paper; 
      over 60 raster manipulation programs; over 30 vector manipulation 
      programs; nearly 30 multi-spectral image processing manipulation 
      programs; 16 data management programs; and 6 point file management 
      programs.  
    </para>
    
    <para>
      GRASS' strengths lie in several fields. The simple user interface makes 
      it an ideal platform for those learning about GIS for the first time.  
      Users wishing to write their own code can do so by examining existing 
      source code, interfacing with the documented GIS libraries, and by using 
      the GRASS Programmers' Manual. This allows more sophisticated 
      functionality to be fully integrated within GRASS.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Other strengths include GRASS' pioneering of mixed resolutions in a data 
      base, mixed geographic coverage areas in a data base, raster image 
      compression techniques via run-length encoding and reclassification 
      lookup tables, GRASS' rescaling of display images on the fly to fill the 
      display screen, plus its fundamental design criterion of powerful 
      computer-assisted scientific analysis of environmental issues (as 
      opposed to merely going for intricate cartographic output of relatively 
      simple processes).
    </para>
    
    <para>
      GRASS is usually supplied as free, non-copyright source code to be 
      compiled on host machines.  Some compiled binaries are also easily 
      obtainable at no cost via the Internet.  It runs on a variety of UNIX 
      platforms.

    <title>A Brief History of GRASS</title>
  
    <para>
      In the early 1980s the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers' Construction 
      Engineering Research Laboratory (USA/CERL) in Champaign, Illinois, began 
      to explore the possibilities of using Geographic Information Systems to 
      conduct environmental research, assessments, monitoring and management 
      of lands under the stewardship of the U. S. Department of Defense.  Part 
      of the motivation for this action was new responsibility for the 
      environment encoded into the National Environmental Policy Act of the 
      late 1970s.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Bill Goran of USA/CERL conducted a survey of available GISs, assuming 
      that he could find several systems capable of environmental analysis, 
      from which he could select one or more to recommend for use by CERL and 
      perhaps others in the Department of Defense.  However, he was surprised 
      to find no GIS that satisfied his needs.  What started as a selection 
      process turned into a design exercise for his own GIS development 
      program.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      USA/CERL hired several programmers, and began by writing a hybrid 
      raster-vector GIS for the VAX UNIX environment.   This made the team one 
      of the first to seriously develop GIS for UNIX.  Though they still faced 
      challenges with different versions of UNIX, they developed procedures of 
      coding in ANSI standard UNIX, avoiding "tweaking" the code toward any 
      particular vendor-specific flavor of UNIX.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      GRASS developed a programming style characterized by:
    </para>
    
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Use of UNIX libraries where possible, plus the creation of GRASS 
          libraries for repeated GIS-specific acts such as opening raster 
          files that might be compressed (by run-length encoding) or not.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The ability to handle both major GIS data types: raster and vector.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The favoring of raster data processing, as scientific analysis was 
          easier to encode with raster (than for vector) data models.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The ability to handle raster grids of mixed grid sizes in the same 
          data base.  This was a departure from raster's image processing 
          tradition of requiring identical (and perfectly registered) grid 
          cell arrays in each and every data layer.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The ability to handle raster grids with different areas of 
          coverage.  Again, this was a departure from raster tradition of 
          having all grids be identical in geographic coverage.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The ability to run-length encode raster data files, in order to 
          greatly reduce file sizes of most files.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The separate structure of reclassification files.  Such files 
          merely contained a look-up table noting the previous and new 
          classes.  This is MUCH more compact than replicating the original 
          grid with different numerical values.  A reclassified file of a 
          100x100 km square area of 10 metre grid cells would be a few 
          hundred bytes, rather than 100 megabytes of uncompressed 8-bit 
          raster data.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The acceptance of de-facto standard data models.  While competitors 
          created cumbersome (and in many cases secretive) data formats, 
          GRASS accepted the de-facto standard Digital Line Graph vector 
          format and unheaded binary raster grid format.  GRASS later 
          abandoned DLG as its internal vector file format, and let its 
          raster format evolve.  However, DLG and the unheaded binary raster 
          grid are still routinely handled formats for GRASS, and its new 
          formats are as open as its previous ones.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
        <para>
          GRASS code was managed in several directories.  Initial 
          contributions were placed in the src.contrib directory.  More solid 
          code was moved to the src.alpha directory.  After remaining in the 
          src.alpha for one full release cycle, the code, with resultant bug 
          fixes, moved to the most honorable level, the src directory.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>     
      GRASS was overseen by three levels of oversight committees.  USA/CERL 
      kept the ultimate responsibility for GRASS.  It implemented most GRASS 
      development, and carried out the day-to-day management of GRASS testing 
      and release.  The GRASS Interagency Steering Committee (GIASC), 
      comprised of other Federal agencies, met semi-annually to review 
      development progress, and evaluate future directions for GRASS.  
      (Academic and commercial participants in GRASS also attended GIASC 
      meetings; only part of each meeting was "Federal-Agencies-only."  GRASS 
      eventually became nominally and officially a "product" of the GIASC, 
      though everyone recognized USA/CERL's leadership role.  The GRASS 
      Military Steering Committee met periodically to review the progress of 
      GRASS in serving its original intent: meeting the Department of 
      Defense's needs to evaluate and manage the environment of military 
      lands.  
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The public interacted with CERL and GIASC through USA/CERL's GRASS 
      Information Center.  GRASS Beta testing was very widespread, and quite 
      intensive for the leading users of GRASS.  Several leading users, such 
      as the National Park Service and the Soil Conservation Service, selected 
      GRASS as its prime or only GIS.  They made significant commitments to 
      enhance and test GRASS, yet considered this investment well worth their 
      while.  They said that they had more influence over the direction of 
      GRASS than they would over any known alternative system.  They also felt 
      that, despite their major efforts and expenses in supporting GRASS, they 
      had a bargain in relevant power for the dollar.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Several universities adopted GRASS as an important training and research 
      environment.  Many conducted short-courses for the public, in addition 
      to using GRASS in their own curricula.  Examples of such leading 
      academic users of GRASS are Central Washington University, The 
      University of Arkansas, Texas A & M University, The University of 
      California at Berkeley, and Rutgers University.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Though GRASS received some criticism (some say) for being so good and so 
      public, it was also reputedly borrowed from liberally by some developers 
      of other systems.  Though the first group might have viewed it as unfair 
      competition, the second group may have noted that it was not copyright, 
      and was a valuable testbed for GIS concepts.  GRASS received an award 
      from the Urban and Regional Information Systems Association (URISA) for 
      quality software in 1988.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      As CERL and GRASS evolved through the late 1980s and early 1990s, CERL 
      attempted to cut overhead costs associated with supporting the public 
      domain version.  It created and initially funded the Open GRASS 
      Foundation, in cooperation with several of the leading users of GRASS.  
      The Open GRASS Foundation has since evolved into the Open GIS 
      Consortium, which is aiming for more thorough interoperability at the 
      data and user interface level, but appears not to be taking advantage of 
      the major open GIS testbed (GRASS).
    </para>
    
    <para>
      In 1996 USA/CERL, just before beginning the beta testing for GRASS 
      version 5.0, announced that it was formally withdrawing support to the 
      public.  USA/CERL announced agreements with several commercial GISs, and 
      agreed to provide encouragement to commercialization of GRASS.  One 
      result of this is
      <ulink url="http://www.las.com/grassland/"><citetitle>GRASSLANDS</citetitle></ulink>,
      a commercial adaptation of much of GRASS.  Another result is a migration of 
      several former GRASS users to COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) GISs.  
      However, GRASS' anonymous ftp site contains many enhancements to the 
      last full version 4.1 release of GRASS.  Many organizations still use 
      GRASS feeling that, despite the lack of a major release in five years, 
      GRASS still leads the pack in many areas.

    <title>A Re-Invogorated GRASS Management Model</title>
  
    <para>
      In late 1997, a group at Baylor University took the lead in developing a 
      new Website for GRASS.  This quickly developing Website contains GRASS 4.1 
      source code and Sun Solaris binaries, GRASS 4.1 documentation, and an on-
      line manual.  By November 1997 this site posted the first version of GRASS 
      4.2 source code and binaries currently for Sun Solaris) with Linux and 
      Windows NT under consideration).  GRASS 4.2 incorporates several  
      enhancements from the CERL website, plus some of Baylor's own 
      enhancements.  Documentation for GRASS 4.2 is appearing; the group 
      encourages cooperation in further development of GRASS, and is looking for 
      partners.  It hopes to use increased use of the World Wide Web in 
      developing and managing GRASS.  GRASS 5 development and compilation is 
      underway.  The site also links to the Blackland GRASS site at Texas A &amp; M

      Note: An ad-hoc group (which includes myself) is exploring the basic issue 
      of continued, reconfigured, yea perhaps increased, value of GRASS as a 
      public test-bed for GIS technology.  It is exploring shepherding the 
      testing and release of GRASS5.0, and exploring possibilities for a more 
      distributed management model for GRASS design and development.  It is 
      exploring the universe of public domain spatial data processing software 
      (including geographic information and image processing systems), and 
      perhaps tabular data base management systems.  How can such knowledge be 
      (1) optimized as an open, public test bed for such technology and (2) 
      better used by the public?  Might this involve a Linux management model, 
      perhaps?  See Section 8 for more discussion on this topic.

    <title>How to Acquire GRASS</title>
  
    <para>
      GRASS used to be available on tape from various companies that signed 
      distribution agreements with USA/CERL.  These companies usually 
      supported specific platform environments, such as Masscomp, Sun, DEC, 
      Hewlett Packard, IBM (risc), PC (running some flavor of UNIX), and 
      Macintosh (running AUX).  Until recently, the flavors of UNIX working on 
      PCs generally were too low-end, or required too much added programming 
      support (e.g. programming drivers for high-end graphics boards like the 
      Number Nine boards of several years back) to be stable or complete.  
      However, with robust systems like Linux, this problem is history.  
      Similarly, few people acquire GRASS on tape, though a few do on CD-ROM.

          distribution might be more valuable if it contained source code and/or 
          compiled binaries for GRASS.

    <para>
      Appendices A, B, and C describe how to acquire and install GRASS.  
      Before actually installing GRASS, you will have to decide where to put 
      three parts of the system:
    </para>
    
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The GRASS binaries, source code (if you install this), man pages, 
          documentation, and the like.  Many folks put this stuff off 
          /usr/local (e.g. /usr/local/grass/bin, /usr/local/grass/src).
        </para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The GRASS executable and gmake utilities.  Some folks put this 
          stuff off /usr/local (e.g. /usr/local/grass/grass4.1 and gmake4.1 
          or /usr/local/bin/grass4.1 and gmake4.1).
        </para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The GRASS data directories.  These can go anywhere, as they are 
          specified in configuration files.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          I have used a different scheme for a decade.  As GRASS code, binaries, 
          and the like (except data owned by users) are all owned by the special 
          user "grass" I don't want this stuff to get spread around my system.  I 
          create a new directory (usually on a separate file system) called /user, 
          and put all my GRASS stuff below this.  For example:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          <programlisting>
/user/grass4.1/bin   (I usually put grass4.1 and gmake4.1 here...)
              /data
              /dev  
              /etc
              /man
              /src
              /src.alpha
              /src.contrib
          </programlisting>
        </para>
        
        <para>
          I'm currently building a GRASS5.0 site, which then goes under:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting>
/user/grass5/bin
            /data   (some GRASS5 data formats have changed...)
            /dev
            /etc
        </programlisting>
        
        <para>
          The GRASS Installation Guide (described in Section 10 and in Appendix C)
          is useful for getting GRASS running, even if you merely install the 
          binaries as described in Appendices A and B.  Please don't overlook one 
          important detail:  Most GRASS installations separate user from software 
          manager accounts and UNIX permissions.  You should create a "grass" (the 
          quotes here are for emphasis, and should not be part of the actual user 
          userid) user account on your workstation.  All installation and 
          configuration of grass should be done by user "grass".  Untar (or 
          un"cpio" files, run setup configuration utilities, run Gmakefiles (GRASS 
          versions of makefiles), and edit configuration files as user "grass."  
          Then only RARELY run GRASS as user "grass."  (I only run GRASS as user 
          "grass" when I am making archival data files in the PERMANENT mapset.)  
          This is done for much the same reason as not running user software as 
          user "root".  YOU CAN DO TOO MUCH DAMAGE AS USER "grass"!
        </para>
        
        <para>
          Beyond the instructions in these appendices, and information in the 
          GRASS Installation Guide, you have some additional housekeeping to do, 
          such as developing a data base.  You can acquire sample data bases from 
          USA/CERL (directory pub/grass/grass4.1/data at anonymous "ftp 
          moon.cecer.army.mil"), start from scratch following instructions in the 
          GRASS Programmer's Manual (and, to a lesser degree, buried in the 
          functional descriptions of the GRASS User's Reference Manual).
        </para>
        
        <para>
          I personally recommend that you start with the Spearfish and Global 
          databases available from USA/CERL:  
        </para>
        
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              The Spearfish data base covers two 7.5 minute topographic sheets in 
              the northern Black Hills of South Dakota, USA.  It is in the 
              Universal Transverse Mercator Projection.  It was originally 
              created by Larry Batten (now of the Environmental Systems Research 
              Institute's office in Boulder, Colorado) while he was with the U. 
              S. Geological Survey's EROS Data Center in South Dakota.  The data 
              base was enhanced by USA/CERL and cooperators.  It is an excellent, 
              and well-used (there are many training materials available for 
              GRASS with this data base) example of a county-scale GIS project in 
              the UTM projection.

              The Global data base was developed by Bob Lozar of USA/CERL to 
              prototype a latitude-longitude "projection" data base in GRASS for 
              global environmental study and decision support.

        <para>
          Starting with these two examples, you can build your own data bases in 
          UTM and latitude-longitude projections.  (Note, many people don't call 
          latitude-longitude a projection.  Others disagree, saying that anything 
          that transfers the Earth's surface to two dimensions is a projection..  
          We'll stay away from that debate here.  Needless to say, lat-lon is 
          treated as other projections are by the computer program.)

          USA/CERL's announced intention is to use GRASS and COTS (commercial 
          off-the-shelf software) for internal uses, to leave the GRASS 
          public web- and ftp-site on its system indefinitely, and to sign 
          cooperative research and development agreements with three 
          companies: (1) the Environmental Sciences Research Institute 
          (ESRI), (2) Intergraph, and (3) Logiciels et Applications 
          Scientifiques (L.A.S.) Inc.  The first two agreements encouraged 
          the incorporation of GRASS concepts into ESRI's and Intergraph's 
          commercial GISs.  The third encouraged the adaptation of GRASS' 
          concepts and code into a new commercial GIS by L.A.S.  L.A.S. also 
          offered to encourage the continuation of a public domain GRASS, as 
          a viable stand-alone system and as a potential source of new ideas 
          and code for L.A.S.'s GRASSLAND.  One observer noted that the first 
          two agreements might be akin to someone signing Linux over to 
          Microsoft.  The same observer considers the experiment by/with 
          L.A.S. to be an interesting possibility - an attempt to keep viable 
          public domain and commercial versions of GRASS.

          Some people believe that GRASS will wither without USA/CERL's 
          central management.  Some believe that the Open GIS Consortium will 
          successfully guide industry into an open architecture that will 
          benefit all developers and users.  Others believe that OGIS' effort 
          will lead to a cacophony of almost similar (but not quite 
          interoperable) vendor-specific "standards," so the loss of GRASS as 
          an open development platform will be felt sorely.

          division" and lead to a cacophony of internally valuable, but

          Use as a scientific, as well as a traditional graphically oriented 
          GIS.  Many GISs can make pretty maps.  Many of those GISs cannot 
          easily perform certain scientific analytical functions as easily or 
          powerfully as GRASS.  GRASS was designed and developed in response 
          to a perceived need for scientific GIS, specifically for 
          environmental analysis, and the environmental management/protection 
          of public lands.  Incidentally, there is at least one Web-based 
          GRASS version.

          and serves them up to the requester.  More on that later.

          Education.  GRASS is easier to teach and learn than some other 
          GISs.  It is easier to modify (for those that want to learn GIS as 
          computer science, rather than as "geography") than most other GISs 
          that come without source code and treat the program as a magical 
          black box.  And, of course, it is more affordable for the student 
          of GIS than many other GISs.

      Who would be the Linus Torvalds equivalent in this management model?  
      Perhaps no single person.  I have been involved in GRASS for about a 
      decade, when GRASS was the only GIS that satisfied my needs in 
      scientific data management and GIS application.  Indeed, I had been a 
      dedicated avoider of the user-unfriendly UNIX environment until GRASS 
      forced me to learn it.  Several senior GRASS developers are active in 
      GRASS-related activities and would like to see the continued vitality of 
      an open GRASS.  It's likely that a reborn GRASS would attract a new crop 
      of friends.  Thus the concept of a "Central Committee" to collectively 
      lead GRASS' transition to a more open management and development style.

* GRASS 4.1 Update 3 for Linux
*
* This package contains GRASS programs only, *NO* GIS
* data is included.  You can find example GRASS data at
* moon.cecer.army.mil
*
* Compiled by: Andy Burnett - burnett@zorro.cecer.army.mil
* compiled on: April 7, 1994

********************************************************************
System Requiremnts:

        35 MB disk space to hold the binary distribution

System library requirements:

        libc4.5.21 or greater

        libX.so.3.1.0 or greater

If you are running libraries that are older than these, this binary
distribution will *NOT* run on your linux system.

INSTALLATION:

        To install this binary distribution of grass for linux, you 
can simply run the ginstall script or you can unpack the files by 
hand.  I recommend using the ginstall script ... it's very simple and 
should be bullet proof.  To run the ginstall script, you will need 
gawk (gnu awk) installed on your system and it needs to be in your 
PATH.

If, however, you want to do things by hand, here's what you need to 
do:

o  make the destination directory (/usr/grass, /usr/local/grass,
   whatever)  This will become your GISBASE for grass.

********************* LOOK HERE **************************************
from here on, replace $GISBASE with the name of the directory you just
created
********************* LOOK HERE **************************************

o  cat grassa? | gzip -d | (cd $GISBASE; tar xvf -)
   This will unpack all the grass binaries into the $GISBASE directory

o  copy $GISBASE/etc/moncap.sample to $GISBASE/etc/monitorcap and edit
   it.
o  change all occurrences of GBASE in that file to $GISBASE
o  copy $GISBASE/etc/grass4.1 into a public directory (I suggest
   /usr/bin)
o  edit the copy you just made: 
   change all occurrences of GBASE to $GISBASE

The GRASS4.15 for Linux was compiled in my Linux box with the 
following configuration:
        Slackware 3.0
        kernel 1.2.13
        gcc 2.7.0
        libc 5.0.9
        flex 3.5.2

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
~ IMPORTANT: ~
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
THE LINUX GRASS 4.15 BINARIES ONLY WORK ON ELF-LINUX. THE BINARIES MAY 
NOT WORK WITH EARLY VERSION OF KERNEL AND/OR GCC AND FLEX.

The binaries was tared and gziped, then split into 9 (close to 1.3 MB 
- 1200 x 1K block) files named from linuxg.aa to linuxg.ai.

You should ftp all the linuxg.a* in binary mode and also get this 
readme file and an installation script - install.sh.  Please put all 
of these files in the same directory - source directory.

At the source directory under the UNIX prompt, type
        sh ./install.sh full_path_to_the_destination_directory

and it should automatically unzip and untar the linuxg.a* files to the 
destination directory and also edit several site-specific files.  The 
total space your need is about 26 MB.

At the destination directory, your can find the grass4.1 script.  It 
should have been modified to reflect your installation directory.  
Now, either move/copy the grass4.1 file to one of your PATH or use the 
link command as below:
        cd /usr/local/bin
        ln -s destination_directory/etc/grass4.1 grass4.1

Now, you are ready to start GRASS by typing grass4.1 and you should
know how to run GRASS afterward.

There is a readme directory in the destination_directory/etc 
directory.  This directory has several readme files that come with 
some incoming commands.  You can find all the compiled commands of 
this binaries in the commands.readme file.  I can't guarantee that all 
of them work but I have tested lots of them.  If you find some 
commands that don't work, please post a message on the grass user 
group and we can solve it all together.

      Don't forget this site.  There are several tutorials on some of GRASS' 
      more advanced programs in the pub/grass/grass4.1/document directory.  
      There are two options for source code (I'm only discussing GRASS 
      version 4.14 here, though version 4.15 is also available)  The 
      pub/grass/outgoing directory contains many contributed functions (and 
      many other candidates for enhancing your system).

      Follow the README.4 file for installing GRASS version 4.14 (which is 
      sometimes called version 4.1.4) source code.  Follow the README.5 file 
      for installing GRASS version 4.15 (which is sometimes called version 
      4.1.5) source code.

    <para>
      After installing the source code, uncompress and print 
      installGuide.ps.Z (or the troff version, if you prefer that and got it 
      from a neighboring directory).  You might also want to uncompress and 
      print refman.ps.Z and progman.ps.Z at the same time.  Note that 
      progman.ps.Z is called the programmer's manual, but also contains 
      valuable information about data formats and directory structures.  
      Advanced users may also want to know the GRASS system utilities, even 
      if they won't be calling them in code.

      Now, use the GRASS Installation Guide (from installGuide.ps.Z) to 
      guide yourself through the installation.  The thickness of this 
      document may at first be intimidating.  However, if you installed 
      Linux yourself, you should be ready to tackle a GRASS installation.  
      Don't be surprised if a function or two does not compile on your 
      system.  I have a couple of uncompiled functions on my own Linux 
      system.  Fortunately, these are functions that I don't use...  Some 
      day I'll get back to them, fix them, and compile them!?

COMPILATION STEPS OVERVIEW

 (1) Generate files that contain location and machine specific make
    information.

 (2) Edit files containing lists of location and machine specific
     programs to be compiled (generally printer, digitizer, and graphics
     drivers).

 (3) Run GRASS compilation script

 (4) Run GRASS program linking script

 (5) Edit device driver configuratin files

 (6) Compile GRASS contributed, alpha programs.

 (7) Compile GRASS related and hybrid programs.

COMPILATION STEPS (DETAILS)

(1) Generate make support files

Each machine and location needs to have GRASS compiled in ways that specify
different:

     compilation and load flags
     system libraries
     installation directories
     idefault data bases and locations
 
The shell script utils/setup assists you in define many of the make
options and definitions that will become part of every compile-time
generated makefile (about 350).  It also creates your shell script for
compiling individual GRASS programs - gmake4.2.

Run "utils/setup" and answer the questions.

The makefile portions are placed in the head/ under a name which you
specify/approve in the utils/setup process.  The executable shell script
which directs compilation is placed in (by default) /usr/local/bin.

Examine the just created file in head/ to make sure things are ok.
A brief description for each defined variable follows:

  ARCH            = Key name identifying the architecture of the machine
                    on which you are compiling GRASS.
  GISBASE         = Directory into which compiled GRASS will be contained
  UNIX_BIN        = Local directory where the GRASS entry program and gmake
                    will be contained
  
  DEFAULT_DATABASE= Directory where local GRASS data bases are contained
  DEFAULT_LOCATION= GRASS data base that users get as the first default
  
  COMPILE_FLAGS   = Compilation flags
  LDFLAGS         = Load flags
  
  TERMLIB         = System library containing low-level cursor movement
  CURSES          = System library that supports screen cursor control
  MATHLIB         = System math library
  LIBRULE         = Method for archiving and randomizing libraries
  
  USE_TERMIO      = Flag to use the termio library if available
  USE_MTIO        = Flag to use the mtio library if available
  CAN_CLEAR       = Flag indicating that the terminal screen can be cleared
  DIGITFLAGS      = Flags to set owner and priority of the v.digit program

(2) Edit files containing lists of location and machine specified programs

The directory lists/ contains files that list directories that will
be compiled.  Directory names are relative to the GRASS src
directory.  The file lists/GRASS lists all basic GRASS programs that
get compiled at every site.  The file lists/local and lists/$ARCH.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    $ARCH is the architecture name you approved while running the
    utils/setup script.  You can determine this by running:
        gmake4.2 -sh | grep ARCH
    -----------------------------------------------------------------

There man not be a lists/$ARCH file, but you are free to create it to
add names of programs you want compiled specifically for this
architecture.  It is an architecture-specific list which allows NFS
linked source code to compile one set of programs for one machine,
and another set for another machine.  All machines that share the
same source code via NFS mounts will compile the directories listed
in lists/local.

All lists may contain comment lines - indicated by a # as the first
character in the line.  The lists/local file contains lists of all
digitizer, graphics, and paint (hard-copy map) drivers.  All machine
specific devices are commented out - you must uncomment those that
are particular to your site or architecture.  You are encouraged to
move the graphics driver items to the appropriate lists/$ARCH file.

(3) Run GRASS compilation program

The script GISGEN drives the compilation process.  If all goes well
you will be able to simply enter the command GISGEN and wait.  The
entire compilation process takes from about 1/2 hour on the faster 
workstations to about 8 hours on the slower workstations.

GISGEN collects all of the directory names to be compiled from lists/GRASS
lists/$ARCH and lists/local and begins running gmake4.2 in each directory.
Screen output is a collection of messages from GISGEN and from the UNIX
make program.  Failure at any step will halt compilation.  On failure
you might do one of the following things:

  1 - Fix a compilation problem by modifying code in the directory that
      failed.  After modification, return to this directory and rerun
      GISGEN.  Compilation will pick up at the failed directory and continue
      down the list of directories if successful.

  2 - Restart GISGEN.  If the failure requires modifications to code already
      compiled, or the compilation options you set in step 1, you must 
      remove next_step/$ARCH (or next_step/next_step if ar architecture name 
      was not specified in step 2.  You may then rerun GISGEN.

  3 - Skip the failed directory.  In this case you must seek through the 
      files list/GRASS lists/$ARCH and lists/local to determine the directory
      name that follows the failed directory name.  The failed name is in
      next_step/$ARCH and must be replaced in that file with the next name.
      After editing, rerun GISGEN

When complete GISGEN will put the word DONE into the next_step file and will
print the phrase "DONE generating GIS binary code" to the screen.

(4) Run GRASS program linking script

The GISGEN directs a compilation process that stashes the GRASS programs 
away in directories unavailable to the user community.  Most user commands
are actually links to a single program called "front.end".  Links to this
program must be made for every actual GRASS program.  This is done AFTER
GISGEN is finished.  To make (or re-make) links for all user programs
run the script MAKELINKS.

(5) Edit device driver configuratin files

Your compiled system may any combination of several graphics, paint, and
digitizer drivers.  Refer to the GRASS installation instructions for
details.

NOTE:  If you have trouble compiling your graphics driver, go to the directory
$GIS/src/display/devices and compile the proper drivers manually using gmake4.2.

(6) Compile GRASS contributed, alpha programs.

GRASS programs come in three flavors:

  MAIN - The programs are those compiled in step 3.  They have stood the 
         test of time and are generally reliable programs.

  ALPHA - Alpha programs are intended to be included with the MAIN programs
         in the next release.

  CONTRIB - Sites generate lots of special purpose programs in GRASS to get
         some job done, but do not polish the effort sufficiently to 
         even be considered alpha code can be distributed in this category.

ALPHA programs are found in the directory src.alpha.  You, the installer
may visit these programs and compile any that you desire.  In directories
that contain Gmakefile files, simply run: gmake4.2

CONTRIB programs are in the directory src.contrib.  The state of these
programs are varied.  Some programs may compile with gmake4.2; others 
are suitable as a starting point for programmers who will be writing
new software.

(7) Compile GRASS related and hybrid programs.

The GRASS user community has discovered that there are several public-domain
programs that are very useful in conjunction with GRASS.  These are found
in the directory src.related.  Compile these programs based on instructions
(or lack of instructions) in the individual directories.

Hybrid programs are those that mix the capabilities of GRASS with the 
capabilities of one or more of the "related" programs.  These are found
in the src.garden directory.  They require successful compilation of
the "related" programs and generally compile using the gmake4.2 and
the included Gmakefile files.

The rest of the compilation should just take some time.  If you have 
already installed GRASS binaries, you should back up your system (or 
at least get the working binaries out of the way of your 
compilation!).

Good Luck!  And be secure in the likelihood that you can use the 
compiled binaries if you bail out of a full compilation of the source 
code.

    <para>
      GRASS has been developed for over a decade as completely unrestricted 
      public domain source code and executables.  Though there was initial 
      resistance to the existence of such robust software in the public 
      domain, many competitors learned to take advantage of GRASS.  It has 
      reputedly been the intellectual stimulus for several enhancements to 
      other GISs.  Several companies conducted business by installing and 
      customizing public domain GRASS for customers, and by providing other 
      value-added services such as data base development.  
    </para>
    
    <para>
      As USA/CERL no longer supports the public version of GRASS, users are 
      free to use what currently exists.  They're also currently completely 
      on their own.  At least where the public domain version is concerned.

      adapted from the public domain
      version by Logiciels et Applications Scientifiques (L.A.S) Inc. of 
      Montreal.  In a recent check, LAS 
      sold its GRASSLAND for Sun, Linux and Windows NT.  LAS is trying to 
      encourage the continuation of a robust public domain Linux, partly as 
      a source of new ideas and code for their own developments.

      In the Installation Guide (pp. 10-11) you will see mention of the 
      [header] file in directory $GIS/src/CMD/header (where $GIS is the 
      directory in which you place GRASS - some folks put this in /usr/local - 
      I put everything in a GRASS' own filesystem/directory /user/grass4.1).  
      The installation guide favors Sun systems, as these were the development 
      environment for GRASS4.  (In case you cared, Masscomp workstations were 
      earlier development environments.)  Below are examples of this &lt;header&gt; 
      file for linux (which you might want to name linux in your 
      $GIS/src/CMD/header directory.  You may want to refer to this section 
      when running the setup ($GIS/src/CMD/utils/setup) command.
