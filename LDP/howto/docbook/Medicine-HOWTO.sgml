                        Major changes. Conversion from linux-doc to Doc-Book format. Have basically edited out nutrition sections and most of the German section for now until I can get help again the German section. Have switched focus of the article to Medical informatics and applications, less to research applications
which should probably be a different article. Will most likely put these things
I will not maintain at the end, so someone else has some where to begin.

Below you will see many applications for the medical community.  Typically, you would download and install a single application, and resolve any issues that arise during an installation.  Debian-Med solves that installation issue.  The Debian-Med project leaders will note that an application is a medical or biosciences related application. </para> 
		
		<para>After you have installed Debian, you can choose to load either a single application, or you can choose to load Debian-Med.  Loading Debian-Med will install all of the applications that have been designated as medical or biosciences related.

		<para>OpenEMR is a modular, HIPAA compliant, open source, practice management, electronic medical record and prescription writing application.  OpenEMR should have billing capability using FreeB by late April 2004.  The planned billing functionality for OpenEMR will include the ability to generate ANSI X12 or HCFA 1500 forms, or submit bills directly to Medicaid, Medicare or private insurers.   The developers on the project are actively working on completing the billing functionality.  2.5.2 is the latest version of OpenEMR and includes the ability to find the first available appointment on the calendar for a provider, direct links to encounters from the calendar, different calendar views for a provider or office staff, reporting using phpMyAdmin and prescription writing.</para>

<para>OpenEMR uses Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP.  OpenEMR incorporates the work of several open source projects such as PostCalendar from PostNuke for calendaring, and phpMyAdmin for database reporting and manipulation.  OpenEMR is also integrating the work of FreeB for billing.</para>

		<title>VISTA (DHCP)</title>
		
		<para> <ulink url="http://www.hardhats.org"> VISTA</ulink> is a largest and most comprehensive of open source medical projects.  VISTA is an open source application that is funded by the federal government for use by the Veterans Administration at its hospitals and clinics.  I used this system, when I was a resident, in the VA hospital, and it was the best system that I had used.  This is a wonderful project that I can recommend.  I am not sure about the software license, but the software and documentation are available from the U.S. Federal Government.  To obtain the software you must file a Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA") request.  The current fees to obtain VISTA on CD are $53US for the main VISTA packages and $13 for imageing.  <ulink url="http://hardhats.org/foia.html"> REQUESTS</ulink> to get access to the software on CD.  Some of the cost may be on-line, so please email the team at hardhats.org.

		<title>WorldVista and OpenVista</title>
		<para> <ulink url="http://www.worldvista.org">WorldVista and OpenVista</ulink> are open source variants of VISTA.</para>
<para>WorldVista helps make healthcare information technology more affordable and more widely available both within the United States and internationally. WorldVistA extends and improves VistA for use outside its original setting through such activities as developing packages for pediatrics, obstetrics, and other hospital services not used in veterans' hospitals. WorldVistA also helps those who choose to adopt VistA successfully master, install, and maintain the software. As the group of VistA adopters and programmers grows, we work to develop it into a collaborative, consensus-based, open-source community.
		</para>
<para> The OpenVistA project will help its adopters eliminate these fees by allowing VistA to run on the GT.M programming environment and the Linux operating system, both of which are open source and free.  Historically, VISTA required adopters to pay licensing fees for the systems on which it runs: the programming environment (MUMPS) and the operating system underneath (such as Microsoft Windows or VMS).  By reducing licensing costs, OpenVistA frees up money to be spent on medicine, medical professionals, and other resources more likely to directly improve patient care. Like all WorldVistA projects, the OpenVistA project not only provides adopters with the software itself but also transfers knowledge and expertise and builds long-term mutual support relationships between adopters and the rest of the worldwide VistA community.  This software is for medical clinics, FQHC, hospitals, medicine training facilities, and community medical clinics.</para>

		<title>SQL Clinic</title>

		<para>
		<ulink url="http://www.sqlclinic.net"> SQL clinic</ulink> is an impressive application that was developed for mental health workers, sponsored by their local hospital. What is most impressive is the amount of documentation.  SQL Clinic in its current format may require additional customization for use outside of mental-health projects.  
		</para>
	
					<para>
					SQL Clinic is designed to be reverse engineered and used for medical or other purposes.  SQL CLinic is based on Lincoln Stein's CGI.pm module and the incredible horsepower of PostgreSQL.  The developer's goal for SQL Clinic is for the project to have utility as an example of how to access postgres via Perl than as a mere clinical application.

While the field of medical informatics shares the general scope of these interests with some other health care specialties and disciplines, medical informatics has developed its own areas of emphasis and approaches that have set it apart from other disciplines and specialties. For one, a common thread through medical informatics has been the emphasis on technology as an integral tool to help organize, analyze, manage, and use information. In addition, as professionals involved at the intersection of information and technology and health care, those in medical informatics have historically tended to be engaged in the research, development, and evaluation side of things, and in studying and teaching the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of data applications in health care. However, today medical informatics also counts among its profession many whose activities are focused on dimensions that include the administration and everyday collection and use of information in health care.

	<para>I will try to be pretty cook book about how to install these applications, which means that if I can, i will always tell you what to type (at least what to type that works for me).  The problem is that this assumes that you know what a shell window is and can switch directories with-in, which actually assumes a fair level of technical sophistication since most of us have gotten used to Microsoft based Windows systems. Which is to say that a lot of us only have interacted with a computer using a Graphics User Interface (Gui's), and that these installation require that you be familiar with Command Line Interfaces (CLI) like a terminal window or a shell.
	</para>
	<para>If you don't know what I am talking about then I recommend you ask someone (me possibly) about what shell windows are, and probably what a UNIX-based Operating system looks like, especially without a GUI.

			<title>What is it?</title>
			<para>
			The OIO system starts a higher level of abstraction
			- starting with modeling "forms". The forms are then
			used to model/build progress notes etc. The OIO system
			makes use of a relational database back-end (PostgreSQL) - 1) making the data/metadata/presentation separation more distinct, 2) making integration with other system (e.g. legacy systems, GNUMed, SQL Clinic etc) easier, 3) making query construction/extension easier (via SQL).
			</para>
			
			<para>If you search the OpenHealth mailing list archives, you will see extensive discussion regarding this in the context of GEHR and OIO. GEHR uses the same approach but calls this intermediate level of abstraction "archetypes".  The advantage of the OIO/GEHR approach is that the metadata components can be plug-and-play - meaning that the system can be easily extended/customized AND portable medical records become easier to implement.

I ran into this same problem after the end of day light savings time. :-)
The reason for this is that PostgreSQL does not like US/Pacific for time
zone. The fix is to provide the time stamp in GMT time.

The fix is to add the following to the OIO/forms/archive_form/archive_b
method:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
&lt;dtml-if time&gt;
 &lt;dtml-call "REQUEST.set('time_string', _.str(time.toZone('GMT')))"&gt;
&lt;/dtml-if&gt;
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
(it goes right before the following, make sure time=time_string in the
parameter list)
==========================================
&lt;!--#in "putin_archived_forms_c(
                   form=name,
                   archivedname=newname,
                   version=newversion_value,
                   time=time_string,
                   creator=creator,
                   description=description
     )"--&gt;
==========================================
So, basically the new routine converts the time stamp into GMT time - I
think GMT-7  or GMT-8 for US/Pacific, depending on daylight saving time
status.

Best regards,

Andrew

			<title>Basic Installation of FreePM</title>
			<para>Given that Tim Cook has put together everything you need to get a fully running FreePM application, I will first deal with installing the application as if you downloaded the full 14MB gzipped file. However, since Zope can be installed separately, and you  may have other Zope applications going on, I will also discuss how to install the FreePM Zope product separately from installing Zope.

				<title>Using the 14MB FreePM download</title>
				<para>Once you have downloaded the 14 MB package, be sure to also download the extensions_for_1.0b6.tar.gz. At this point, it really doesn't matter what directory you have download the gzipped tar files into, but to play it clean and safe, I would download them or move them into their own directory. Then go ahead and <userinput> gunzip FreePM-1.0b6-FULL-linux2-x86.tar.gz </userinput> to unzip the file and then <userinput>tar xvf FreePM-1.0b6-FULL-linux2-x86.tar.gz</userinput>
				</para>
				<para>Once the tar file has finished unpacking, you should see a new directory called FreePM-1.0b6-FULL-linux2-x86.  To make things easier I would change the name of this directory to 'FreePM' like so <userinput>mv FreePM-1.0b6-FULL-linux2-x86 FreePM</userinput>

			<title>Running the Zope Server</title>
			<para>Tim Cook also wrote two scripts to start the server and stop the server. Be sure you our in the FreePM directory.  You will know this if you see the files 'start' and 'stop' in there.  It is also the same directory where you ran the <userinput>./install</userinput>.  To start the Zope server, type <userinput>./start</userinput>.  However you might want to type <userinput>./start&</userinput> to make it a background process which will free up your terminal window.  This will also allow you to stop the Zope Server by typing <userinput>./stop</userinput> instead of hitting the CRTL-C key combination, a rather blunt way of stopping the Zope server and not an aesthetically pleasing way of stopping the zope process. 
			</para>

		    <sect4>
			<title>Installing the FreePM zope products </title>
			<para>The key thing before I talk about installing the zope products is that, the first user, Admin, can only add other users and can not by itself actually manage any products.  You first need to add a new user and make the user a manager before you can do anything else.

			<para>
			To log into the running Zope server, you need to open a browser, type in http://127.0.0.1:8080 or depending on how new the Zope server is http://127.0.0.1:9673.  If you look at the output during the install it will tell you what to what port to connect.  <caution><para>Note: Using the old port 8080 would conflict, which is why Zope changed the port connection.</para></caution> At this point you should the zope introductory page, if not, make sure you have the correct port.

			<para>Go ahead and click on the link that says Zope management interface or enter http:127.0.0.1:8080/manage and you should the zope management screen.

			<para>I am having problems successfully logging out completely using zope, so when you intend to switch users, be sure to completely close all browser windows.</para>
			<para>Once you added a new user that has the role of manager, log back in.  That is to say, Close all browsers and open up a new browsers and go to the zope management screen.  You should be asked for a login at this point.  Go ahead and enter in you new user login and password.</para>
			<para>Once you are logged in as an user (not the admin user), go ahead and click on the Root Folder on the top of the left frame. Scroll to the bottom of the Right Frame and you should see the Import/Export button. You see a new screen. In the Field Import File Name, enter FreePM Product.zexp and then hit the import button.

Then hit the Import button. <caution><para>Note that it will take some time to import the FreePM.zexp Zope product as it is quite large and you may get a browser error. I almost lost hair doing this stage because I could not figure out what was going wrong. In fact nothing was going wrong, it just took some time to import this large (32MB) zope product.  If you want to make sure something is actually going on, I recommend using the <userinput>top</userinput> unix command, which will show you that python is actively still working to import FreePM.zexp.</para> </caution></para>

		<title>Slicer</title>

      <para>The 3D Slicer uniquely integrates several facets of
      image-guided medicine into a single environment. It provides
      capabilities for automatic registration (aligning data sets),
      semi-automatic segmentation (extracting structures such as
      vessels and tumors from the data), generation of 3D surface
      models (for viewing the segmented structures), 3D visualization,
      and quantitative analysis (measuring distances, angles, surface
      areas, and volumes) of various medical scans.</para>
      
      <para> The 3D Slicer is freely available and provided as open
      source software. Its design is fully modular to encourage
	researchers to extend its functionality. It's new home is at

	<para>
		About: KPumpe is a diabetes diary application with support for reading records from your glucometer. It supports the Onetouch Ultra and other glucometers where glucomodule plugins are available.
	</para>
	<para>I haven't used this one yet, but I plan on installing it at work, and getting my patients to start using their glucose monitoring machines more.</para>

			<title>Too Many Projects</title>
			<para>Having spend some time on looking at the available software, I can only say that currently, we simply have an abundance of development, but little progress.  I keep seeing multiple projects trying to achieve the same thing, but the resources are spread too think and so they fail.  I wonder if there were some way to concentrate the various developers onto one project.  The questions remain as to what main ideas should be focused on. Obviously the first one should be a Medical records application.  That is a coherent, portable, way to contain, process, and use all the medical data that is generate by a patient.</para>
			<para>The second focus should be on software for a working clinic. This seems to be much harder since it would involve the billing section.  However this would also include things like scheduling and multitude of forms that a clinic uses in day to day use.
			</para>

			<para>The third focus (one I know little about) would be in the more specialized applications like Imageing, which seems to already have quite a bit of working software, but is inherently hard to make because not everyone has access to CT scanners and such.
			</para>

			<title>I am biased</title>
			<para>The other thing I want to point out is that this is not an un-biased LDP, I may stress something more than others because I think the foundation is better or that I have seen it actually work, so if you feel something is not right, please feel free to let me know.

			<title>Debian as Standard linux distribution</title>
				<para>I realize that urging people to consider Debian as the standard linux system when it comes to medical applications is probably like arguing about religions. But.. :) The point is that our audience is not Linux gurus who only use slack or can configure applications from source tar balls.  Debian provides an extremely sophisticated and easy to use installation process that is ideal for people who want to get a system running.

		<sect2><title>I work and what is needed.</title>
			
			<para>Now that I have been working for almost two weeks, here are a few things I have learned.  While a resident, I did part of my training at the VA hospitals which had a superb information system, but it required that we type out everything from the smallest order to the emergency stat orders.  This seemed to work well for the VA since most of the Doctors had residents do their notes or they tended to dictate very little, writing very brief, sometimes cryptic, notes about the status of their patient.  Now that I am in the private world, the only thing that seems to be saving medicine are the transciptionists who take the garbled speed talk that doctors do and type out coherent statements.  The problem that I see with many of these data systems is that seem to assume that doctors have the time which they don't (there is barely enough time to see a patient properly let alone do all the coding and then write out a clear note.</para>
<para>Several idea come out that doctors will merely have to tick off boxes on a palm device to indicate what they did, but this is fine for billing but not so for the actually medical record, which even though is brief contains much more subtly then any billing coding system could have.  Perhaps what we need is to maintain the medical record in its narrative form and have a parser go through it and pull the important bits and then it would enter this stuff into database. It is an idea, but surely a worthwhile one since Doctors simply can not sit around computer terminals (as I am doing, but it is a Sunday)
