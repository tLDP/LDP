This mini-HOWTO covers the installation and use of
the most popular amateur packet-radio BBS server
software "FBB". That software works under Linux,
DOS and Windows operating systems. It serves as a
bulletin board system (BBS), a mailbox for
personal messages, a database for various texts,
documents and binary files, a server for small
useful calculations etc. Packet radio is a way of
connecting computers via amateur radio stations. 
</abstract>


<sect>Introduction

<p>
I have been using FBB amateur radio software since
early nineties. It was the time of DOS operating
system, so most of us, system administrators (or, so
called system operators - sysop's), used various 
packet radio <em>server</em> software for DOS. 
Versions of FBB packet radio BBS <em>server</em> 
software for DOS, today are known as "DosFBB". 

<p>
I still administer one DosFBB database in the SRV 
(Amateur Radio Union of Vojvodina, a part of SRJ). 
It is DosFBB v7.00g23 that runs on a 486DX computer 
with 16 MB of RAM and Hercules b/w graphics. Since 
December 1999, it runs without any re-boot (excepting 
some power failures). Before that, it was a bit 
tricky to set up all memory management properly, in 
order to avoid "frozen" system. Although this server 
runs under DOS, its "radio clients" don't depend
on that. In fact, users of that DosFBB might run
their client software under DOS, Windows, Linux
or any other operating system that offer amateur
packet radio abilities. 

<p>I have also used DosFBB v5.15c on a 286/12 box at home. 
Five years ago, when I got better box, Pentium I at 166 MHz with 
32 MB of RAM and VGA color graphics, I switched to a Windows 
version of FBB ("WinFBB"). Author of the software, a radio amateur 
from France, Jean-Paul F6FBB, has made many versions of WinFBB, 
including 16 bit variant for Windows 3.x and Windows 9x as well as 
32 bit variant for Windows NT. I have run both variants until now 
(at the moment it is 16 bit WinFBB v7.00g25 that runs great under 
Windows NT 4.0).

<p>Update: In late 1999, I upgraded my system to 
Celeron 400 MHz, added more 64 MB of RAM and 
switched to bigger hard disk that will have enough room 
to install Linux and try LinFBB ...

<p>Update: Since Spring 2001, I run WinFBB v7.00i
(17 March 2001) under Windows 2000 Professional.  

<p>The main
difference between DosFBB and WinFBB is that the
second one offers you to do other jobs with your
computer, while FBB is running as just any other
application. Besides that, it is always nice to
copy some text from another application (for example,
from an Internet email) and to paste it into a
packet radio message, or vice versa.

<p>Update: In July 2001, I added  more 128 MB of RAM 
so my home system is very confortable now.

<p>Finally, you should be aware what I want to
have here:
      <tscreen><verb>
      1. WinFBB when I run Windows.

      2. LinFBB when I run Linux. It should be an
         Xwindow application that may be
         started/stopped similarly to WinFBB.
         That's why X11 LinFBB package is used.

      3. LinFBB when I run Linux, but as a daemon
         that runs in the background. In addition,
         an interface for a local user (myself)
         is needed, as well as an interface to
         monitor the radio channel.

      4. All three versions must be capable to
         share the same configuration files, i.e.
         to be able, for example, to begin a new
         session from the exact position where the
         other version has finished its own last
         session.

      5. I am not an expert in Linux, so I am
         only able to install "factory-made"
         packages for Linux (just like to install
         self executing software packages under
         Windows). I mean of RPM packages. So, there
         are no source (re)compilations here at the
         moment, but in the future we will see  :-)
         </verb></tscreen>


<sect>How to install X11 (Xwindow) version of LinFBB

<p>
<itemize>

<item>First of all, you should have running Linux
      with a GUI installed. I am fully satisfied
      with Gnome GUI but I suppose that KDE will
      be OK too (or any other GUI available).

<p>
<item>Download or copy LinFBB (the main ftp site
      is <url url="http://ftp.f6fbb.org/" name=
      "ftp.f6fbb.org"> but there are many mirror
      sites too). For example, if you get a file
      like <tscreen><verb>x700e_full.tgz</verb></tscreen>
      it means that it is X11 version 7.00e and it
      contains all you need in tgz archive to install
      the BBS. On the other hand, a name like
      <tscreen><verb>xd700g_full.tgz</verb></tscreen>
      means that it is not X11 but daemon version 7.00g
      and it is also complete to unpack. Further,
      <tscreen><verb>x700f01.tgz</verb></tscreen>
      and <tscreen><verb>x700g.tgz</verb></tscreen>
      are "upgrades" to any previous "full" package.
      For example, after I have upgraded to <tt>x700g.tgz</tt>
      I started to run X11 LinFBB 7.00g (04 August 1998).
      BTW, X11 versions are not maintained anymore, but
      I still run it here. It has some bugs but I like it.

<p>
<item>Copy the archive file in <bf>/tmp</bf> directory.

<p>
<item>You have to make a "base" directory where
      your FBB will be installed. For example you
      may type: <bf>mkdir /usr/local/fbb</bf> if you want
      FBB to be there. You have to be logged as
      'root' or 'superuser' to install FBB.

<p>
<item>Then, you should locate yourself in that
      directory: <bf>cd /usr/local/fbb</bf>.

<p>
<item>Now, you should unpack the archive:
      <bf>tar xvzf /tmp/x700b25.tgz</bf> (<-- use the right
      name of the archive here).

<p>
<item>When you finished unpacking the archive,
      you may continue installing the software:
      <bf>./install.sh</bf> is the command for that. The
      setup will ask you for the 'base' directory
      where FBB will be installed. If you chose
      <bf>/usr/local/fbb</bf> again, you will be told that
      such directory already exists and all files
      will be overwritten. It is OK, so you should
      answer yes. If everything is fine, you should
      see on the screen that fbb system
      directories are created. At the beginning
      of that procedure, program will ask you for
      BBS's callsign, name of the city, QTH
      locator, your name etc. That details will
      become a part of <bf>/usr/local/fbb/init.srv</bf>
      file.

<p>
<item>After that, you MUST check this file
      <bf>again</bf> manually in order to fix some other
      details needed (because installation script does
      not fix all parts within that file).

<p>
<item>Well, so far - so good. After you have checked
      all configuration files, you may start the
      software: <bf>./xfbb.sh</bf> (<-- type this within
      an <em>xterm</em> or something similar). When you
      start your BBS for the first time, it will ask
      you to create some files it needs, so you
      should answer "yes" to the questions.

</itemize>


<p>
<sect>How to install LinFBB in addition to existing WinFBB

<p>
<em>Notice: Folks, you see, at my place, I have a
dual-boot system, consisting of Windows NT and
Linux (each of them having their own partition(s)
and file system). I wanted to have 'independent'
operating systems that won't see each other. So I
made two NT's partitions as NTFS partitions and
rest of the space used Linux as ext2 & swap partitions.
Well, at first I have installed WinFBB under NT and X11
LinFBB under Linux. Both of them worked, but there
was a big "problem": I could not share their
system files. You might say: So, what a big deal.
But, my FBB's should serve as packet-radio forwarding
stations (regardless of which one I boot at the
moment), so it was really needed for new LinFBB
to "know", for example, the position where WinFBB
has stopped the mail exchange last time (and vice-
versa, of course).</em>

<p>
<itemize>

<item>Well, in order to allow both WinFBB under
      Windows NT and LinFBB under Linux to use
      the same system files, it is needed to put these
      files in a place that both operating systems are
      able to "see". So I do that by re-installing
      WinFBB onto a FAT (FAT16) partition that is
      recognized by NT and Linux too. The best way to do
      that is to install a "fresh" copy of WinFBB on
      a FAT partition and to copy complete "old"
      WinFBB from NTFS partition over the fresh
      installation (whenever you are asked to
      rewrite existing files, you should answer
      "yes").

<p>
<item>When that is finished, you should have a "clone"
      of the existing old WinFBB, but this time on
      the FAT partition that is visible from under
      Linux. Anyway, you should check if the "new" one
      installation is able to run properly as the "old" one.

<p>
<item>I could also recommend you to check the file
      tree of WinFBB in order to become more
      familiar with it. The file tree of LinFBB
      is a bit different so it is advisable to
      note various details here and there.

<p>
<item>Some files can't be used as they are under <em>both</em>
      operating systems (without some necessary
      changes). That's why some file names should
      be renamed (or, at least, you should make
      appropriate copies of some files):

<p>
      <tscreen><verb>
      init.srv    ->  init_w.srv
      forward.sys ->  forw_w.sys
      port.sys    ->  port_w.sys
      protect.sys ->  prot_w.sys
      </verb></tscreen>

<p>
      FBB is able to recognize and accept those renamed files.

<p>
<item>Make a backup of the actual WinFBB (I do that
      by copying the whole WinFBB file structure into
      the other Windows partition that <em>won't</em> be
      shared with Linux, like NTFS one). You'll never
      know when a catastrophe may happen, so as a result,
      you won't be able to start neither of the "old" WinFBB or 
      the "new" LinFBB. As a precaution, the backup might be the
      easiest way to recover at least the old WinFBB for
      a while (until you configure your new LinFBB, OK?).

<p>
<item>Now, you should restart your machine and boot
      into Linux. Log on as 'root' or make 'su' from a
      user's account.

<p>
<item>Mount a shared FAT directory (where FBB files are):
      <bf>mount -t vfat /dev/hda2 /mnt/win</bf>
      (for example). If that works, later you may adopt that
      change within your <bf>/etc/fstab</bf> configuration.

<p>
<item>Copy LinFBB archive to <bf>/tmp</bf> directory.

<p>
<item>Position yourself to the 'base' directory:
      <bf>cd /usr/local/fbb</bf> (for example).

<p>
<item>Unpack the archive: <bf>tar xvzf /tmp/filename</bf>.

<p>
<item>Start the installation script <bf>./install.sh</bf>
      and, after asked for the 'base' installation
      directory, chose <bf>/usr/local/fbb</bf>. It doesn't
      matter if the program warns you that such
      directory already exists so existing files
      will be overwritten (by the way, if you
      choose a mounted directory shared with NT,
      many original WinFBB files, located there, would be
      over-written by LinFBB files, so after returning
      to Windows, WinFBB might not be as functional
      as before this installation).

<p>
<item>Copy <bf>/usr/local/fbb</bf> to <bf>/mnt/win/fbb</bf> but do
      *not* rewrite existing files with the new files
      having the same names.

<p>
<item>Copy <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/init_w.srv</bf> to
      <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/init_l.srv</bf> file.

<p>
<item>Edit <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/init_l.srv</bf> to what is
      needed for Linux. You may use the existing
      file <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/init.srv</bf> as an example.

<p>
<item>Copy newly edited <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/init_l.srv</bf>
      over the <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/init.srv</bf> (if you do
      not do that, maybe you wouldn't be able to start LinFBB
      using <bf>./xfbb.sh</bf>, like me at the first time).

<p>
<item>Copy <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/system/port_w.sys</bf> to
      <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/system/port_l.sys</bf> file.

<p>
<item>Edit <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/system/port_l.sys</bf> to
      what is needed for Linux and LinFBB. You may use the
      existing file <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/system/port.sys</bf>
      as an example.

<p>
<item>Edit <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/xfbb.sh</bf> in order to fix
      the right path.

<p>
<item>Ensure that you are in FBB's main directory:
      <bf>cd /mnt/win/fbb</bf> (for example).

<p>
<item>Start the script <bf>./xfbb.sh</bf> to run LinFBB.
      If everything is OK, your LinFBB under Linux
      should run with the <em>same</em> configuration as
      your "old" WinFBB under Windows. From this point,
      both FBB's should behave very similar (actually,
      I must admit that WinFBB has much better visual
      quality than X11 LinFBB, but probably the reasons
      for that you may find in Windows-vs.-Linux-GUI
      quality "battle field"). FYI, my actual WinFBB is v7.00g25
      (05 January 2000) and X11 LinFBB is v7.00g (04 August
      1998).

<p>
<item>Although this combination WinFBB/X11 LinFBB works fine, I
      have noticed some problems. For example, LinFBB
      was not able to use <tt>amsat</tt> forward_to_file routine
      (located in <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/system/fwd</bf> directory),
      because that file was composed like this (for example):

<p>
      <tscreen><verb>
  A AMSAT
  *
  P @
  *
  C D:\FBB\SYSTEM\SAT\AMSAT.TXT     <-- looks familiar to DOS/Windows only
  *
  G AMSAT
  *
  --------

      </verb></tscreen>

<p>
      On the other side, LinFBB's <tt>amsat.sys</tt> (located
      in <bf>/etc/ax25/fbb/fwd</bf> directory) has suggested
      something like this:

<p>
      <tscreen><verb>
  A AMSAT
  *
  P @
  *
  C /var/ax25/fbb/sat/amsat.txt     <-- looks familiar to Linux only
  *
  G AMSAT
  *
  --------

      </verb></tscreen>

<p>
     Well, then I copied LinFBB's <tt>amsat.sys</tt>
     into <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/system/fwd</bf> directory so
     it could become functional. As a result, I got
     <em>two</em> <tt>amsat.txt</tt> files, one of them
     for each of WinFBB/LinFBB, and of course, both files
     appeared on different locations: the first one was
     <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/system/sat/amsat.txt</bf> and it
     was filled by WinFBB; the other one was in
     <bf>/var/ax25/fbb/sat/amsat.txt</bf> and was filled by
     LinFBB. I didn't like it that way.

<p>
     In order to have only <em>one</em> result,
     regardless of FBB version, the newly copied
     <tt>amsat.sys</tt> had to be slightly changed:

<p>
      <tscreen><verb>
  A AMSAT
  *
  P @
  *
  *C /var/ax25/fbb/sat/amsat.txt
  C /mnt/win/fbb/system/sat/amsat.txt
  *
  G AMSAT
  *
  --------

      </verb></tscreen>

<p>
     As you can see now, when LinFBB is active, its
     <tt>amsat.sys</tt> will not forward into
     its "native" location of <tt>amsat.txt</tt>.
     Instead of that, it will go to the location
     of the WinFBB's <tt>amsat.txt</tt> and just
     add some new materials into it, OK?

<p>
     Well now it's up to you to decide what to do
     with your growing <tt>amsat.txt</tt>. An old
     DosFBB manual says that the 'batch' file
     (I suppose, the old good <tt>APPEL.BAT</tt>)
     should be adopted in order for <bf>SATUPDAT.EXE</bf>
     can update <em>sat</em> tracking data and, after
     that, to erase AMSAT.TXT because it is not
     needed anymore. Well, I haven't found a way to
     manage that in both WinFBB and LinFBB. Actually,
     whenever I perform housekeeping from either of them,
     it seems that AMSAT.TXT remains intact. Happily,
     it doesn't grow too much, so it's not a big problem.
     Any suggestion here?

<sect>How to install Protus password utility

<p>
<em>Notice: Well, I have been using Protus
<bf>connection filters</bf> for a long time now. 
At first, it was the version 3.1/1.2 for DosFBB515c
and, later, version 3.3 for Dos/WinFBB700. I have 
found Protus as very useful utility because of its 
implementation of automated BBS-to-BBS
forwarding protection, using MD2 algorithm.
One of the reasons to cover Protus
in this document is the fact that its author
haven't made a manual in English yet. I keep
trying to translate original manuals
from Spanish into English, but it is a hard work.
Any good 'Spanish-to-English'
translator is welcomed to contact me:
skoric at eunet dot rs</em>

<p>
Protus offers several interesting features:

<p>
<itemize>

<item>It can send a presentation message to
      all users, informing about possibility
      to make users' access more safe,

<p>
<item>It can send messages to users who have
      usual, non-restricted access, informing about 
      utility's existence,

<p>
<item>It can send messages to users who have no
      valid access (before disconnecting them),

<p>
<item>It can send messages to new users who have
      connected the BBS for the first time, informing
      them about the password utility.

<p>
<item>It can send messages to users who have entered
      wrong password (before disconnecting them),

<p>
<item>It can inform sysop about almost everything
      related to users' connections (new user on
      the system, unsuccessful connections etc),

<p>
<item>Messages mentioned above could be translated
      into various languages and used similarly as various
      language files that FBB system use,

<p>
<item>Messages mentioned above could be different
      for different BBS ports,

<p>
<item>Protus could be activated/deactivated at various
      intervals of time using CRON.SYS system file,

<p>
<item>Passwords could be managed remotely, using an
      external server, developed by Jose EB5IVB,

<p>
<item>...

</itemize>

<p>

Well, let's see what should be done in order to
implement secure access to the FBB packet
radio BBS, using Protus type of, so called, <em>c_filter</em>:

<p>
<itemize>

<item>Users of Dos/WinFBB versions of Protus
      already know that it is needed to create a new
      directory <bf>\FBB\PROTUS</bf> where several 
      *.PRT files should be placed. In addition, the
      main C_FILT*.DLL files should be copied
      into <bf>\FBB\BIN</bf> directory, as well as a couple 
      of "system", (i.e. config) *.PRT files that are going to 
      be within <bf>\FBB\SYSTEM</bf> directory.

<p>
<item>After the sysop has copied all files into
      their proper locations, it is needed to make
      some configuration. The most important files
      are two "system" ones: <tt>CONFIG.PRT</tt> and 
      <tt>USERS.PRT</tt> that should be carefully 
      adopted to any particular situation. Other *.PRT 
      files will work as they are in original, but they may
      be translated because they are originated
      in Spanish (those files are just the parts of
      information that are sent to users who
      connect to the BBS). For your information,
      I usually don't care much about, because my
      BBS's are so called "open systems". It means
      they work quite normal for <em>all</em> users in the
      same way as they worked <em>before</em> 
      implementing Protus. Only a couple of callsigns 
      have password installed and, when connecting,
      they know what they are doing, so, they don't need
      any additional info. Your mileage may vary.

<p>
<item>So far - so good. After everything mentioned has
      been done, you have to restart your FBB in order
      for Protus utility to be activated. In all
      connections to your BBS (including console),
      you should see a line like this: <bf>{PROTUS-4.0}</bf>
      just after the well known line &lsqb;&lsqb;FBB-7.00-AB1FHMRX$&rsqb;. It
      only gives an information that Protus is active on the
      system. Users of your BBS who don't have
      their passwords, connect just normally as before.
      Users who's callsigns have password implemented,
      are prompted for password just after their connections.

<p>
<item>The author of Protus, Jesus EB5AGF, has made
      several working "modes" of its utility. It
      is possible for users to have various kinds
      of passwords: a fixed phrase (similar as those you
      are used to when connect to the Internet
      via telephone line, but this way the phrase
      can be masqueraded within the longer answer);
      a changeable answer to the 5 random numbers (just
      like usual FBB sysop's password); a mode
      that uses automatic answer from user's client
      packet programs; implementation of MD2 and
      MD5 algorithms; FBB-to-FBB automatic
      protection etc. FYI, my WinFBB is equipped
      with 16-bit Protus 4.0 (13 August 1999).
      There is also a 32-bit module of the same date
      that would be called from within 32-bit WinFBB
      (I haven't tested those 32-bit applications).

<p>
<item>Well, the situation regarding working location
      of Protus files under LinFBB is somewhat different.
      I have become familiar to the directory structure
      that DosFBB and WinFBB versions of Protus have
      been using, so I considered that it was enough
      to implement the same directory structure when
      I started the installation of Protus under LinFBB.
      It was wrong. After having pulled out the
      remaining hair, the things started to work, so,
      now I am going to tell you what to do.

<p>
<item>I have already told you that I have been running 
      here both WinFBB under Windows NT and LinFBB 
      under Linux (see also <tt>Linux+WinNT mini-HOWTO</tt> 
      and <tt>Lilo mini-HOWTO</tt>). That means all Protus 
      stuff has already been installed in a way WinFBB has 
      required, except <em>Linux</em> executable of 
      <em>c_filter</em> file. I put that one file into <bf>/fbb/bin</bf> 
      directory and, after the next restart of LinFBB, I got the
      info mentioned above: {PROTUS-4.0}. But the
      password protection was not likely to work.
      I was told by the author to make a new directory 
      <bf>/var/ax25/fbb/protus</bf> and put *.PRT files there. 
      I <em>didn't move</em> files from <bf>\FBB\PROTUS</bf> 
      but rather <em>copied</em> them into the new location, 
      because I wanted Protus to continue working under WinFBB 
      as before. The utility still didn't want to run, unless I 
      <em>also</em> copied additional two *.PRT files from 
      <bf>\FBB\SYSTEM</bf> to the same new location
      (<bf>/var/ax25/fbb/protus</bf>). After I did that, Protus 
      became functional.

<p>
<item>Well, I suppose, the above info would be
      useful for those of you who intend to run
      *both* Windows and Linux FBB's on the same machine.
      For the majority of LinFBB-only users, it is just
      important to make <bf>/var/ax25/fbb/protus</bf>
      where <em>all</em> *.prt files should be placed. 
      <em>Only</em> c_filter executable should go to 
      <bf>/fbb/bin</bf> and that's it.

<p>
<item>About FBB-to-FBB protection: *both* partners
      have to install Protus. Password for the
      forwarding partner's callsign must be the
      same at *both* sides of the link. The versions
      of Protus don't need to be the same (neither
      the versions of FBB, neither the operating
      systems, HI!). Anyway, MD5 algorithm will only
      work if both parties have Protus 4.x and
      above (I still don't use that, but it is not
      a problem, because my two boxes, DosFBB-Protus3.3 and
      WinFBB/LinFBB-Protus4.0, make all things OK with MD2).

<p>
<item>One of the interesting features of Protus is to
      log unsuccessful connections. Due to the
      <em>different</em> locations of *.prt files here, I have
      separate logs for WinFBB and LinFBB "c_filtering".
      Those of you who are going to run only one operating 
      system and appropriate version of FBB, will have <em>one</em> 
      complete log of connection errors, users make when try to
      connect your BBS.

<p>
<item>As it was told earlier, if you implemented
      password protection for only <em>some</em> of your
      users (but not for all of them who connect
      normally) - your system is considered as
      the "open" one. It means that will be logged
      only unsuccessful tries to enter the system
      by "protected" callsigns. But, if you decided
      that your BBS can be accessed by <em>only</em> those
      callsigns who have Protus password, that
      means your system is the "closed" one.
      Then, there is no way a user could enter your
      FBB unless its callsign has given a password
      within your Protus. Any unauthorized try to
      connect your BBS is also logged.

<p>
<item>In addition, you may decide to have a "guest" 
      access or a "read-only" as <em>default</em> for 
      some BBS's access ports and/or for users who enter 
      the wrong password. Many combinations are possible. 
      You could even password protect your own FBB console!

<p>
<item>To finish with this topic for now, just to
      inform you that my X11 LinFBB is equipped
      with Protus v4.1b7 (15 February 2000). It
      has some minor bugs, for example, it logs
      incoming connections with a SSID of -48 if
      a user doesn't have a SSID at all (of course,
      in such case a SSID of -0 would be expected).

<sect>How to install "xfbbd", a daemon version of LinFBB

<p>
<em>Notice: You see, folks, that I keep trying to get
as many as possible versions of this great
software (Jean-Paul, F6FBB, must be very proud after
reading these words now). What I think when mention
"as many as possible versions" means that we have
learned how to get both WinFBB and X11 LinFBB on
the same computer. But, that's not all. There is a
variety of daemon versions of LinFBB. In this section
we are going to discuss how to *add* a daemon LinFBB
to the existing two: X11 LinFBB and WinFBB!</em>

<p>
<itemize>

<item>Well, many amateurs have suggested me to install
      a couple of packages that weren't look to me as
      really requested for LinFBB daemon to work.
      Anyway, I installed those packages <em>before</em>
      the installation of LinFBB itself:

<p>
<tscreen><verb>
      libax25.rpm
      ax25apps.rpm
      ax25tool.rpm
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
<item>Now it is the right time to install <tt>fbbsrv.rpm</tt>
      package. The archive was composed to make its
      own directories, as "base" directories. The last new
      version to start with, that I have managed to find as
      a <tt>.rpm</tt> package, was 7.01f Release 4 (09 December
      1999).

<p>
<item>A file called <bf>fbb.conf</bf>, serving as the
      replacement for <bf>init.srv</bf>, is placed in the
      location: <bf>/etc/ax25/fbb.conf</bf>

<p>
<item><em>Unless</em> you are going to install daemon-<em>only</em>
      system, you should make a backup of the
      following existing files:

<p>
<tscreen><verb>
      dirmes.sys
      etat.sys
      heard.bin
      inf.sys
      statis.dat
      tpstat.sys
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
<item>Now you have to edit <bf>/etc/ax25/fbb.conf</bf>
      and change some paths in case you already
      have X11 LinFBB installed on a <em>different</em>
      path. Here you have some examples that cover
      my particular situation...

<p>
<item>Directory of data files, instead of /var/ax25/fbb,
      should be <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/system</bf>

<p>
<item>Directory of config files, instead of /etc/ax25/fbb,
      should be <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/system</bf>

<p>
<item>Directory of message files, instead of /var/ax25/fbb/mail,
      should be <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/mail</bf>

<p>
<item>Directory of compressed files, instead of /var/ax25/fbb/binmail,
      should be <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/binmail</bf>

<p>
<item>Directory of users, instead of .../home/fbbdos/...,
      should be ...<bf>/mnt/win/fbb/users</bf>... (case you
      don't mind that both your WinFBB and LinFBB users handle
      the same location for users' files)

<p>
<item>Directory of YAPP files, instead of /home/fbbdos/yapp,
      should be <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/users/yapp</bf> (the same
      reason as above)

<p>
<item>Directory of documentation files, instead of
      /var/ax25/fbb/docs, should be <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/docs</bf>

<p>
<item>Directory of pg programs, instead of /usr/local/pg,
      should be <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/pg</bf>

<p>
<item>Path and filename for import file, instead of
      C:\FBB\MAIL.IN should be <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/mail.in</bf>

<p>
<item>Now you have to edit <bf>/usr/sbin/xfbb.sh</bf>
      and change some paths in case you already
      have running X11 version of LinFBB on a <em>different</em>
      path. Here you have an example that cover
      my particular situation...

<p>
<item>Base directory of XFBB software, instead of
      /var/ax25/fbb, should be <bf>/mnt/win/fbb</bf>

<p>
<item>So far - so good. Now it is the time to start
      LinFBB daemon. The command for that is in the
      location: <bf>/usr/sbin/xfbb.sh</bf> and it may
      be executed within an <em>xterm</em>. If
      everything is OK, you should get several
      system messages on your screen, ending with
      something like:

<p>
<tscreen><verb>
      xfbbC/X server running ...
      xfbbd ready and running ...
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
<item>Well, daemon itself can't be used to access the
      BBS so it is needed to activate a <em>client</em>
      that is <bf>/usr/sbin/xfbbC</bf>. It has a couple
      of parameters (a callsign/password pairs that are
      stored in <bf>/fbb/passwd.sys</bf>). Note that xfbbC can
      also be activated within another <em>xterm</em>.

<p>
<item>If you are like me, you would like to activate one
      more <em>xterm</em> with xfbbC in a way to monitor
      your radio frequency. If you have enough room on
      your screen, you may place all three <em>xterm</em>
      windows side by side.

<p>
<item>When you finish your xfbbC console session, it is suitable
      to use the same <em>xterm</em> to eventually stop the
      daemon. First of all, with the command <bf>ps ax</bf>
      you should locate PIDs of xfbb.sh shell and daemon itself,
      that you may <bf>kill</bf> after that.

<sect>How to install an <em>upgrade</em> to a daemon version of LinFBB

<p>
<sect1>LinFBB v7.02g

<p>
<em>Notice: Well, the main trouble I have discovered with 7.01f
daemon was the absence of Protus c_filter protection. As I told you
before, Protus is a "third-party" product, so it might have
some problems with the compatibility to LinFBB itself. Anyway,
it is also possible that a daemon version of LinFBB has some
special requirements over some "third-party" software.</em>

<p>
<itemize>

<item>I also noticed that my version of Protus was <em>newer</em>
      than the version of daemon LinFBB I had at first. Besides
      that, some hams, including F6FBB himself, have suggested me
      to upgrade LinFBB. I have also found a "problem" that I am
      still new in compiling Linux software, so, I'd rather
      look for pre-compiled packages for easy installation.

<p>
<item>Jose, HI8GN, has offered daemon LinFBB v7.02g as a
      <tt>.rpm</tt> package (18 September 2000). I got it
      from his site:
      <url url="http://hi8gn.dynip.com/indice.html" name=
      "http://hi8gn.dynip.com/indice.html">. But, when I tried
      to install it <em>over</em> the previous version 7.01f, it
      complained about some existing LinFBB files.

<p>
<item>Then I had to uninstall the old package, after what
      some config files remained in their locations, but
      with new <tt>.rpmsave</tt> extensions. It was nice,
      so I could use them later to update my new-installed
      config files.

<p>
<item>BTW, the installation of Jose's package was performed
      without problems, but the new daemon was not likely to run
      as I expected, although I tried to configure it as best
      as I could. Not quite sure, but it looked to me that F6FBB
      is likely to implement some changes not only to the main
      executables but to shell files too. So, I have decided to
      save copies of these new
      <tt>xfbbd</tt> and <tt>xfbbC</tt> executables from 7.02g
      package (I have made it with adding extensions like
      .702 to the files). After that, I *uninstalled* the rest
      of that 7.02 <tt>.rpm</tt>, in order to install the previous
      version of LinFBB once again - the version that I was
      satisfied with.

<p>
<item>So far - so good. The "old" 7.01f version was installed again
      and tested one more time to be sure it was OK. Then, I just
      copied the previously saved executables from the new package,
      over the "old" executables. In a couple of minutes, the new
      daemon LinFBB v7.02g has come in place and function. Comments...?

<p>
<item>Well, the new daemon is likely to check for some more directories
      than the older version (mostly related to <tt>7plus</tt>
      operations). Next, its <tt>xfbbC</tt> console client looks better
      than the previous version. But, I still miss graphical
      <tt>xfbbX</tt> client, that I have found not able to become
      activated. I hope it will be fixed soon. Finally, Protus
      <tt>c_filter</tt> utility is active too.

<p>
<item>An interesting question might be: is that now a really upgraded
      LinFBB daemon or not? Actually, I haven't changed the "old"
      script <tt>xfbbd.sh</tt> with the new one, because during the
      first tests with the new 7.02 I was getting lots of error messages.
      Looks that the directory structure was a bit complicated for me
      to set properly within the new version of <tt>xfbbd.sh</tt>.
      After I returned to <tt>xfbbd.sh</tt> from 7.01 package, the
      BBS finally started to be run, though without some functions
      like over-night maintaining (that one problem I solve in a way
      to boot the BBS as WinFBB under Windows NT where that task is OK).
      In addition, there are still some mysterious messages telling
      that <tt>m_filter</tt> has not been found or something like that.
      The next tasks are to solve these issues.

</itemize>

<p>
<sect1>LinFBB v7.03

<p>
<em>Notice: As I have said in the previous section,
I haven't found an easy way to upgrade FBB's (its main
executables), without temporary uninstalling an
older version, then to install the new version - in
order to get new executables. After that is done, a
reverse procedure must be put in place.</em>

<p>
<itemize>

<item>Well, it was needed to get 7.03 package (09 December 2000)
      as an <tt>.rpm</tt> package from
      <url url="http://www.f6fbb.org/versions.html"
      name="www.f6fbb.org/versions.html">,
      that was suggested by Jean-Paul, F6FBB. Anyway,
      soon after there appeared several mirror sites,
      offering 7.03 too.

<p>
<item>If you use <em>GnomeRPM</em>, it is easy to uninstall
      your actual LinFBB (If you just try to install new
      <tt>.rpm</tt> over the existing LinFBB you will get
      some error messages complaining that you already have
      FBB installed on the computer). Anyway, after
      the uninstallation, there you will find some config
      files as <tt>.rpmsave</tt> files, so you could use
      them later again.

<p>
<item>Installation of 7.03 package will give you
      new executables in <bf>/usr/sbin</bf> directory.
      Those new executables should be temporary given
      extensions like <tt>.703</tt> (for example).

<p>
<item>So far - so good. Now you should *uninstall* the
      7.03 package (of course, <tt>.703</tt> files won't
      be unistalled automatically). Uninstall? Why? You will
      find out soon, read on ...

<p>
<item>Once again, you should *install* the <em>last</em>
      one version of LinFBB daemon, that works OK with its
      own <tt>xfbb.sh</tt> (in my case, that is 7.01f).

<p>
<item>For sure, many of you might find it odd, but
      now it is the right time for the executables from
      <bf>/usr/sbin</bf> (I mean of all fbb executables,
      except those who were renamed to <tt>.703</tt>) to get
      their new extensions (in my case, that is <tt>.701</tt>).

<p>
<item>Well, after that is performed, <tt>.703</tt> files
      should *lose* their previously attached extensions,
      in order to become usable.

<p>
<item>Folks, on that point I usually hold my breath, <bf>cd</bf>
      to <bf>/usr/sbin</bf> and type: <bf>xfbb.sh</bf>
      following with an Enter. If everything is fine, several
      lines should scroll on the screen, ending with
      something like:
<p>
<tscreen><verb>
      xfbbC/X server running ...
      xfbbd ready and running ...
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
<item>If you don't get something similar on your <em>xterm</em>
      'window' (or on other appropriate terminal
      utility), you're out of luck, so you might go
      through the procedure once again in order to be
      sure you did all what was needed to be done :->

<p>
<item><bf>/usr/sbin/xfbbC</bf> is the easiest way to
      check if your new 7.03 is in the game
      or not. When I mention xfbbC it is good to let
      you know, that I kept living in a belief that
      xfbbC is also useful for regular telnet users
      (who are also supposed to 'connect' to the BBS via
      the same computer's console, where LinFBB is
      running from). But, I have discovered that my
      users, who were <em>not</em> declared as sysops,
      are allowed to read all messages (including all
      private messages), as well as to have some
      other sysop's abilities. I did think it was
      a matter of probably wrong declared security flags.
      But, it was not.

<p>
<item>Recently, I was informed that <bf>xfbbC</bf>
      is suitable mostly for sysops, so the other users
      (who might also have access to the local
      keyboard) should rather try something less
      dangerous, like this:

<p>
<tscreen><verb>
      telnet localhost 6300
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
<item>... where 'localhost' and '6300' may vary from
      BBS to BBS. I was pleasantly surprised
      when discovered that <bf>telnet</bf> is much more
      suitable for ordinary BBS users than <em>sysops'</em>
      client <bf>xfbbC</bf>.

<p>
<item>Folks, I also think of writing a chapter about
      FBB's system configuration. Until something
      like that appears in this howto, you should know
      that all of those callsigns who are going to
      use <bf>xfbbC</bf> have to be added into
      your <tt>passwd.sys</tt> file. In addition, all
      of these folks who are going to <bf>telnet</bf>
      the BBS, have to be declared as users with
      the 'M' flag (modem users). It is up to your
      security precautions, if either of them would
      eventually have <em>'root'</em> capabilities
      to that one Linux machine itself.
<p>
<item>My next task is to use an old i286/12 MHz box,
      having only 1 MB of RAM, running DOS 5.0, as a
      'telnet client' computer. That box has a network
      card so I would like to 'connect' to the
      BBS from that one 'telnet client' box. If that
      succeeds, it would be a good preparation for
      installing another LinFBB (in the local school
      club), where several old 286 computers will be also
      available. It would be nice to offer more than
      one student-amateur the opportunity to 'connect' the
      BBS simultaneously, using a bunch of vintage
      'telnet client' DOS computers.

</itemize>

<p>
<sect1>LinFBB v7.04

<p>
<em>Notice: Maybe I have already explained that I
use Red Hat 6.2 at home. That's why I usually look
for <tt>.rpm</tt> packages that have been made for
that particular Linux distribution, but not only that. I have
also tried to use Red Hat 7.1 but it seemed not to support
an older Xwindow application, LinFBB 7.00g (04 August 1998).
When I noticed that issue, I returned back to Red Hat 6.2.</em>

<p>
<itemize>

<item>Well, I started by downloading the package
      <tt>xfbb-7.04-2.i386.rpm</tt> (07 August 2001)
      from <url url="http://www.f6fbb.org/versions.html"
      name="www.f6fbb.org/versions.html">

<p>
<item>Folks, this time I finally decided to install
      version 7.04 as a completely "fresh" installation, i.e.
      without some parts of any previously used "daemon"
      on the disk. It means that I have uninstalled the last
      daemon version I was using before, and, in addition,
      I also removed the old executables. Of course,
      before the uninstalation, I made the backup of some
      config files that are not version depending
      (like <tt>/etc/fbb.conf</tt>), in order to avoid
      editing the same "defaults" once again and again :-)

<p>
<item>The setup procedure has reported some dependency
      issues. I didn't want to get bored with them so I repeated 
      the installation once again with "--force" and "--nodeps" 
      options.

<p>
<item>So far - so good. Then, I replaced a couple of
      "default" files with the <em>saved</em> ones.
      After that being accomplished, I mounted a
      FAT partition with WinFBB's system files,
      made a pray and started LinFBB's daemon. It was
      also an interesting new experience to try HI8GN's
      script <bf>/usr/sbin/fbb start</bf> (activated in an
      <em>xterm</em>) to start the server. Although there
      were no usual lines:
<p>
<tscreen><verb>
      xfbbC/X server running ...
      xfbbd ready and running ...
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
on my screen, TNC's <em>PTT</em> lamp confirmed
that a <em>beacon</em> was really transmitted.

<p>
<item>Then I wanted to try HI8GN's script
      <bf>/usr/sbin/monitor</bf> to see what's
      going on the frequency. Although
      I got something like:
<p>
<tscreen><verb>
      Connecting localhost ... Ok
      Authentication in progress ... Ok
      Monitoring channel 0 ...
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
there appeared no traffic on the screen. In order to really
monitor the channel, I had to start another <em>xterm</em>
and type:

<p>
<tscreen><verb>
      telnet localhost 6300
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Bingo! From the usual FBB's prompt I entered the gateway
and typed the familiar "M" ("Monitor") command.
Interestingly, as soon as I "telnet-ed" to the
BBS, <bf>/usr/sbin/monitor</bf> window, mentioned
above, started to copy whatever was going on the
telnet <em>xterm</em> as long as that telnet session
was closed. I was in doubt if that was OK or not,
because there I expected to see the traffic from the radio
channel - regardless being connected to the system or
not. Any suggestion here?

<p>
<item>Well, then I wanted to use <bf>/usr/sbin/bbs</bf>, 
      in order to connect to the client's (or better to say: sysop's) 
      console (<em>xfbbC</em>). Looks that there was a line in 
      HI8GN's script:
<p>
<tscreen><verb>
      xfbbC -c -f -h localhost -i [callsign] -w [password]
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
with missing ./ (dot slash) before xfbbC, so the script
was not likely to be executed. Instead of that it reported
that command couldn't be found. Anyway, <em>xfbbC v3.01</em>
itself appeared to work nice. It is still possible to monitor the
working channel too (using the "M" command from within the
gateway), but this is not a valuable solution because
while "Monitor ON", it is not confortable to do
anything else within the gateway. Once again, solutions
are welcomed!

<p>
<item>Although the active <em>xfbbC</em> session can be
      easily terminated using "B" ("Bye") command, a fooled
      <bf>/usr/sbin/monitor</bf> can not. The user has to
      find its <em>process number</em>, (PID), using <bf>ps ax</bf>
      command and then kill that process.

<p>
<item>At the end of the game, daemon itself should
      be stopped. HI8GN's script <bf>/usr/sbin/fbb stop</bf>
      returns:

<p>
<tscreen><verb>
      Shutting down xfbbd:          [OK]
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
but <bf>/usr/sbin/fbb status</bf>
      reports:

<p>
<tscreen><verb>
      Checking, the FBB daemon
      xfbbd (pid) is running...
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Looks that <bf>/usr/sbin/fbb stop</bf> does not terminate
daemon *every* time the command is executed, but re-start it
(the only difference is the new PID of the process and
<bf>ps ax</bf> can show that new PID). So, there is
a question why it returns that   [OK] when it is
obvious that daemon is not stopped, but rather re-started.

<p>
<item>Well, if you are like me, you may also want to
      experiment with some special sysop's commands, from
      within an <em>xfbbC</em> session. For example, "/R"
      command ("Re-boot PC") shuts down <em>xfbbC</em>
      and <bf>/usr/sbin/fbb status</bf> reports:
<p>
<tscreen><verb>
      Checking, the FBB daemon
      xfbbd dead but subsys locked
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
while "/A" command ("Stop BBS") returns:

<tscreen><verb>
      Stop-request accepted, no connection.
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
before shutting down <em>xfbbC</em> client itself.

<p>
Further attempts to re-start either <em>xfbbC</em> client
or <em>xfbbd</em> server (using <bf>/usr/sbin/fbb start</bf>)
are not successful, unless an additional
<bf>/usr/sbin/fbb stop</bf> is executed. The result is:

<p>
<tscreen><verb>
      Shutting down xfbbd:          [FAILED]
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Now another <bf>/usr/sbin/fbb status</bf> reports:

<p>
<tscreen><verb>
      Checking, the FBB daemon
      xfbbd is stopped
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
so finally, daemon might be re-started again. Here it is
also a mystery why it returns that   [FAILED]
when it is obvious that daemon is really
stopped (maybe it is a "failure" when we try to
stop the same thing <em>twice</em>).

<p>
There are some other commands: "/K" (Re-boot BBS with
housekeeping), "/M" (Re-boot BBS immediately) and
"/L" (Re-boot BBS, waiting users to disconnect) -
all of them with slight different behavior. Anyway, those
three commands have something in common: they all re-start 
the daemon (with different PIDs, of course).

<p>
<item>Finally, what I would like to have is to
      manage housekeeping and other maintaining
      tasks. Until now, that is not accomplished.
      I suppose that I should make some more fine
      customization in system paths. Any suggestion
      about is welcomed.

<sect>How to use LinFBB's "xfbbX", a GUI client for Linux

<p>
2002-10-20

<p>
Well, soon after the installation of LinFBB v7.04
<em>.rpm</em> package, I noticed
a new "kid on the block", i.e. a new item within the
Start menu (under Gnome environment). That was a
"HamRadio" group, having several "Xfbb version 7.04"
sub-items and one of them was "xfbbd X Client".

<p>
It seemed that a mouse <em>click</em> on that
"xfbbd X Client" icon was not likely to return any
response, although <em>xfbbd</em> daemon has been successfully
running <em>before</em> invoking the client. That's why I have
been asking for help (related to that issue) from other LinFBB
users, but it seemed there was no one capable to solve that
problem. Anyway, it looks to me that there is a "dead" link
from this "xfbbd X Client" icon to an existing executable.

<p>
Trying to find a solution, the other day I was browsing the
<bf>/usr/sbin</bf> directory. I have noticed something that
I have already seen for several times. That was <bf>xfbbX</bf>
file. Well, I am sure that I tried to use this <em>executable</em>
earlier, but without much success. This time, I have entered
the full path, like this:

<p>
<tscreen><verb>
     /usr/sbin/xfbbX
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
and, finally, the GUI client appeared on the screen.

<p>
So far - so good. Soon after, I realized that 'Monitoring'
window was capable to monitor the actual traffic on the radio
frequency, but not only that. Headers of all packets appear
in green and the actual information is in blue, so it is easy
to distinguish what is the header and what is the text info
(comparing to my old X11 LinFBB application where everything
came in black).
What I could describe as a disadvantage of the 'Monitoring'
window, is that the scroll bar does not give you much of the
previous, already <em>scrolled</em> traffic.

<p>
The 'All channels' screen was even better, so the system
user correspondents' traffic appeared in green, the local
user's traffic was in black and the port information was in
yellow. Unfortunately, there's no easy way (if any) to
change colors (and that's the standard feature in WinFBB)
for both 'Monitoring' and 'All channels' windows. Maybe I
haven't managed yet to find a switch for that, so any
useful info about is appreciated.

<p>
What I have also found a bit annoying, was that both
windows mentioned above, appear not arranged side-by-side,
a form that would be more suitable. Besides that, the
third window, 'Console', has to be activated with another
mouse click (instead of being activated automatically
with the other two windows). Actually, the whole thing of
<em>xfbbX</em> client seems to be primarily useful for
sysops looking only for BBS's command line, in order to
execute some server's commands etc. That's why I have found
a bit strange why the console window must be activated
separately (OK, I know that's the same with WinFBB's
windows, but why not to add some additional feature?)

<p>
Anyway, the 'Console' connection window has almost the same
functionality as WinFBB's 'Console' window. Here I think
of the commands given at the BBS's command prompt, because
they are invoked from the usual language *.TXT files.

<p>
But, the big disadvantage of today's version of
<em>xfbbX</em> client, I've found here, is the absence of
several useful icons, that I was very fond of within
the WinFBB's user interface. For example, there are
no icons for pending mail, users information,
disconnect a user, edit a message text or a header
etc. It looks to me that <em>xfbbX</em> developers are
not likely to offer the full comfort that we have
within WinFBB's GUI. It makes me wonder why? There are lots
of commands that can not be easily activated without the
proper icons. It drives me crazy whenever I have to
re-boot to Windows to start WinFBB, in order to perform
some simple tasks mentioned, using the mouse.

<p>
Besides that, there is no way to activate that nice
message editor screen, very useful in WinFBB
(also existed in an old Xwindow LinFBB application
v7.00g from 1998!) The same goes for replying
a message, where a sender does not get the text
of a message to be replied to, within the new
message body. In short, I don't like absence of
all those earlier implemented, but now abandoned
features.

<p>
Well, I can't imagine what Jean-Paul, F6FBB, and
other developers would do in the future, but I am not
satisfied with the idea to only keep further development
of LinFBB server side, but, in the same time, to abandon
the development of LinFBB's graphical client side. And not
only that: It looks that MS Windows client for LinFBB server,
<em>xfbbW</em> has been reported to be much more functional
that described xfbbX, while, in the same time, WinFBB server
development has been also stopped. A bit confusing situation,
isn't it?

<p>
Some amateurs think that it is just a result of "global" IT
situation: Linux (as well as other Unix-type platforms) is better
suited for servers, but Windows is better for clients. If so,
it looks that LinFBB packet-radio system operators, "sysop's",
seem to be forced to run at least two computers, in order
to get the same functionality they always had with WinFBB.
I'd rather suggest to Jean-Paul, F6FBB, and other developers
to transfer all known WinFBB's GUI features to <em>xfbbX</em>
GUI environment, in order to avoid using two computers.

<p>
2002-10-30

<p>
A couple of paragraphs ago, I said that "xfbbd X Client" icon
didn't work under Gnome environment. It did make me wonder
if it would work under KDE graphical user interface. So, this
time I started KDE (and I did it as "root" so, in addition, I
also got a mailbox icon on the desktop, named "fbb X11". When I
located the mouse pointer over that icon, there appeared some
more description: "F6FBB bbs Server for Packet Radio").

<p>
Well, when I tried to <em>click</em> on that icon, I got a
KFM Warning message box explaining that program
<bf>/root/.xfbbX</bf> could not be executed. Fortunately,
a "right click" on the icon allowed to enter file's Properties.
The Execute card gave me a possibility to change the path
for a program to be used. So, I did some browsing and located
the new path: <bf>/usr/sbin/xfbbX</bf>. After that, another
<em>click</em> resulted in running the GUI client.

<p>
Interestingly, there is some slight difference between
<em>xfbbX</em> appearance under KDE and Gnome. Actually,
each KDE's <em>xfbbX</em> window has "FBB" logo in the upper
left corner (Gnome's windows haven't that). That may indicate
that <em>xfbbX</em> client was produced primarily for KDE
environment. Besides that, it seems that other features
are almost the same, regardless being within KDE or Gnome
environment.

<p>
On the other side, the already mentioned "xfbbd X Client"
item (within the Start menu, under the "HamRadio" group), still
does not work. I suppose that there should also be some
modifications, related to program executable paths, but I
do not know how to manage that. Anyway, it does not matter
because <em>xfbbX</em> is running here this or that way.

<p>
2003-06-30

<p>
A recent email from Jose, HI8GN, related to the xfbbX GUI client, 
about the RPM package:

<p><em>
"The reason of the why not the xfbbd X Client didn't give you any
answer is for several causes. 1) if the xfbbd daemon is not running
the xfbbd X client won't run. 2) if the xfbbd is dead in its process.
3) if the xfbbd was not shutoff correctly, but delete the xfbbd lock file
as this:</em>

<p><em>
. /etc/init.d/rc.fbb stop or service rc.fbb stop, and then it was run
and didn't create the xfbbd lock file, the shell script looks for the
existence the /var/lock/subsys/xfbbd or /var/lock/subsys/xfbbX lock file
and 4) if the xfbb X11 Server it is running it create a xfbbX lock file
by that the xfbbd X client won't neither run</em>

<p><em>
the same thing makes the X11 Client the one it verifies that the xfbbd is
not running</em>

<p><em>
if you make a click on the Icon that says fbb X11 Client and it doesn't run
it is because the one is seeing that there is a process of the xfbbd
running like as daemon.
the script rc.fbb I have also modified it so that it can not be executed
twice.</em>

<p><em>
if exist xfbbX lock file the xfbbd X client won't run
if exist xfbbd lock file the fbb X11 won't run.</em>

<p><em>
Lastly if you execute the command fbb in the console or in xterminal in
the desktop, you will see what I mean that simple."</em>

<p>
Thanks Jose!


<p>
<sect>How to use LinFBB's "xfbbW", a GUI client for Windows

<p>
2002-11-17

<p>
<em>Notice: Well, folks, I couldn't try to install and use
LinFBB client for Windows, because I have not had
a second computer for that purpose. The only way to
check how this client works, was to borrow a laptop machine
and give it a try.</em>

<p>
The first task was to link that Windows laptop to a Linux
desktop. I had some difficulties with the network card on
the desktop box, because it seemed not to be likely to start
the appropriate <bf>eth0</bf> interface. I'll give you some
more details about the equipment here: Linux is Red Hat 6.2
and my ISA network card has UMC UM9008 chip. Long ago, I
used some utilities that should "recognize" ISA cards (if
I remember their names, that were isapnptools, pnpdump etc).

<p>
What I do know, is that such tools should have add some new
lines into the existing files, like <bf>/etc/conf.modules</bf>
or, to create some new files, like <bf>/etc/isapnp*</bf>.
Well, I have forgotten what exactly should be done, so I
went to look for the right tools. The one that was looking
suitable was <bf>/sbin/isapnp</bf>. Although I got its
response on the screen, telling that the UM9008 chip was
recognized, there was nothing added to the system files,
nor new files seemed to be created.

<p>
What I also tried to use, was the old good <em>Linuxconf</em> tool, that
was already installed per default within RH 6.2 Linux. I
found the right place to add the information related to NIC's
IRQ and I/O address. There I seemed to make a little mistake,
so I put the value of <em>220</em> (for the I/O address), instead
of <em>0x220</em> that would better fit. The result was as one
may expect: the interface <bf>eth0</bf> continued to
report that a <em>ne</em> module had not found a card
at that one address. Then I checked the actual I/O address
the card uses under Windows OS (was the same) and
tried to fix the parameters (Thanks goes to a UK ham who advised
me to have to let Linux know the proper IRQ and I/O
addresses).

<p>
Interestingly, <em>Linuxconf</em> added a couple of new lines
into <bf>/etc/conf.modules</bf> too. In short, the next time
during the system boot, the interface <bf>eth0</bf>
reported a green <em>[OK]</em>, so I could
establish the link. So far - so good.

<p>
The next task was to download the client package from the
FBB's main site. I did it from the <em>"Newest version"</em>
web page and the number of the version was 1.12 (it
seems that was not a pretty much new version, or maybe the
content on that <em>"newest"</em> page has not been updated
recently - another task for Jean-Paul?). Anyway, I installed it 
without any problem, configured its part related to the LinFBB
server it was about to access, changed the console font to my
favorite one (Tahoma) and started the utility.

<p>
At the first sight, the client looked great, because
Linux clients still prefer so small letters, that are
hard to read (compared to characters on a Windows screen).
Now I tried the most used commands like List, Read, Send Reply
etc. All of them worked great. What I have found a bit
strange, was that the <em>message justification</em> did
not work in its message editor window. You see, I like
my messages to be justified on both sides. I hope a solution
for that problem will be found soon.

<p>
Another issue with <em>xfbbW</em> client is that seems not to
allow a multiple click onto more than one
BBS callsign within <em>pending forward</em> list,
comparing to WinFBB's behavior. You know, I am not very fond of
opening the same <em>pending forward</em> window repeatedly
again and again, in order to start (or to stop) more than
one forwarding action.

<p>
In general, I like <em>xfbbW</em> client. I hope to
install some newer version(s) soon, and I hope some of
its features will be upgraded and some new ones will be added
in the future. What I would also like to have, is to
activate the maintenance of the BBS (a "housekeeping" task)
from that client's menu. Another thing I miss at the moment, is the
absence of the <em>xfbbW</em>'s help system. I mean
of a <em>real</em> Windows help, because there's not
much use of a <em>Help</em> menu, having only
<em>Copyright</em> and <em>About</em> information :-))

<sect>How to compile LinFBB's <em>executable</em> files

<p>
<sect1>fbbsrc.704h (using Red Hat 7.1)
<p>
2003-01-01

<p>
<em>Notice: Until recently, I preferred to download "factory-made"
executables in RPM format (something like ZIP in MS Windows world).
After getting a RPM package, a click on it activates the program
that unpack and install its content. Well, it is great whenever
your RPM has been "manufactured" for the very similar distribution
of Linux you have. If not ...</em>

<p>
<itemize>

<item>Well, I have already had the package 
      <tt>xfbb-7.04-2.i386.rpm</tt> (07 August 2001), that was
      running OK under RH 6.2 distro. And not only that. Its
      "packer", Jose HI8GN, has explained that this package
      was actually compiled and linked with utilities that came
      with RH 6.2 - so under that distribution should be no
      problems at all.

<p>
<item>One day I finally decided to abandon another 4-5 year old 
      version of an X11 LinFBB <em>application</em> that I knew it would
      not run under Red Hat Linux newer than 6.2 distribution. 
      I decided to stay with LinFBB's daemon only, so it was also the
      right time to upgrade the Linux system itself. Another handy
      installation that I had, was RH 7.1 and I used it. After
      finishing that task, I rushed to re-install the RPM package
      mentioned above (just to test if it would eventually work), but as
      expected it didn't want to run.

<p>
<item>I had no choice but to browse web sites in order to find a RPM 
      package that would fit my RH 7.1 distribution. Unfortunately,
      it looked that there was no one recompiled LinFBB RPM for 7.1
      RedHat version. The only solution was to try with <em>tarballs</em>. 
      So, what I have downloaded from <url url="http://www.f6fbb.org/versions.html"
      name="www.f6fbb.org/versions.html">, was <tt>xd704h-src.tgz</tt>
      archive.

<p>
<item>So far - so good. Well, folks, I am not very good of "deepest"
      secrets of Linux, so I was not sure where might be the best
      place to unpack the archive. According the <em>readme</em>
      file, it might be a "fbbsrc" directory, so I considered that
      <bf>/usr/src</bf> would be the best location to copy archive's
      <bf>fbbsrc.704h</bf> directory tree.

<p>
<item>Well, the <bf>fbbsrc.704h</bf> directory consists of 12 files and 7
      subdirectories, one of which is <bf>src</bf> subdirectory. As the 
      <em>readme</em> suggested a user to "goto fbbsrc/src" directory, 
      I concluded that <bf>/usr/src/fbbsrc.704h/src</bf> was the right place.

<p>
<item>The <em>readme</em> also suggested to "update the variables" at
      the beginning of <em>Makefile</em> files, but I did not do that
      because I was not sure what exactly should be put in there. So I have
      just left the file(s) intact.

<p>
<item>The next task was to run <em>make</em> command from the shell
      and it took half a minute to be finished. The results were several
      <em>xfbb</em> executable files that I quickly moved to
      <bf>/usr/sbin</bf> directory. BTW, some people rather suggest to run
      <em>make install</em> (instead of <em>make</em>), in order to avoid 
      multiple copying of compiled executables, but I found that way as not 
      functional.

<p>
<item>Soon after, I tried to activate <bf>xfbbd</bf> - the new LinFBB's 
      <em>daemon</em> and it seemed to work without visible difficulties. 
      Using a home LAN including a Windows laptop, I also started <bf>fbbW</bf> 
      - a LinFBB Windows client. It recognized the <em>daemon</em> in a second 
      and I've only noticed that there was no Protus password utility running.

<p>
<item>According the <em>readme</em>, the next task should be to "compile
      the xfbbC client". That operation should be done from a place
      called "fbbsrc/client" but the only available directory under
      <bf>/usr/src/fbbsrc.704h/src</bf> was <bf>X11</bf>.

<p>
<item>After clicking on its icon, I recognized the second one file
      named <em>Makefile</em> (they have mentioned "updating" of 
      <em>both</em> Makefile files, so I hoped to reach the proper
      place once again, regardless of two unfamiliar paths). Besides that,
      they have also suggested to use "at least the version 2.1.37b of 
      ax25-utils" and I found <em>not</em> to have something like that 
      installed (in the case they have possibly meant of a <em>suit</em> 
      of libax25, ax25apps and ax25tool - than it should be OK). Anyway, 
      then I activated <em>make</em> command from the shell one more time 
      and the result was in getting <em>xfbbC</em> executable.

<p>
<item>As usual, <bf>xfbbC</bf> client is to be invoked from within an
      <em>xterm</em> (or similar) command line environment. It also seemed 
      that it was fully functional. So far - so good.

<p>
<item>The next issue was to "compile the xfbbX client", but this time
      a user was requested to have a version of Motif installed. Well,
      what I already knew was that I haven't had any Motif software in the box, 
      but a couple of Lesstif RPM packages were somewhere around. I installed them
      using <tt>--force</tt> and <tt>--nodeps</tt> options in order to avoid
      various <em>dependency</em> 'obstacles'. In sum, Lestiff stuff has 
      come to its place on the hard disk.

<p>
<item>This one time, I did make some "updates" related to <em>Makefile</em>
      paths and tried to run <em>make</em> command from the shell (for
      the 3rd time now). At the first sight, it seemed that I got no answer, 
      because there appeared neither <bf>xfbbX</bf> nor <bf>xfbbX_cl</bf> 
      executables. In order to "make" missing files, I just copied the 
      appropriate executables from an earlier LinFBB version (which I backup-ed 
      before).

<p>
<item>Finally, I managed to activate <bf>xfbbX</bf> client without visible
      problems, although I knew it was not an up-to-date version (compared
      to the <em>daemon</em> itself). Regardless of that detail, the GUI 
      client worked properly.

<p>
<item>As I just mentioned, I also noticed that the first console connection
      was without familiar <bf>{PROTUS-4.1b7}</bf> designation (that means
      there was no <em>c_filter</em> utility running). So, I had
      to check and double-check all the paths and system directories,
      described in the Protus section of this mini-HOWTO. At the first
      sight, it looked to me that everything was fine, but the utility
      was not likely to start. Finally, I copied its main executable
      into yet another system location: <bf>/usr/lib/fbb/filter</bf>,
      re-started the system once again and Protus returned back to its 
      function.

<p>
<item>That was all. I am satisfied with what I have done for the first time. 
      What I have to do in the future, will be to check if the procedure
      described in this section was the right one, although most of the
      BBS's main features seemed to be active (just like as if they were 
      running under RH 6.2 distribution using LinFBB packages in RPM format
      mentioned earlier). The only "mystery" was how to activate some
      system administering tasks: maintenance (a "housekeeping"), get
      user's data and other tasks easily accessed from under WinFBB main
      console (for example). Until now I haven't solved that, but that
      is not a real problem because I can also run WinFBB whenever my
      Windows is active, and from there I can perform sysop's tasks, using
      a mouse click or like.

<sect1>fbbsrc.704j (using Red Hat 7.1)
<p>
2004-01-03

<p>
<em>Notice: The other day I tried to upgrade my Red Hat 7.1
distribution to Red Hat 9.0 - in order to get more up-to-date
system, being also capable to be upgraded from its original Netscape
4.76 browser to Netscape 7.1 (In fact, the more newer Netscape
I need for other purposes - not related to FBB stuff at all - but I have
not succeeded to perform a kind of a 'browser-only' upgrade (In fact,
Netscape 7.1 needs newer <em>Glibc</em> and some other things not
easily being upgraded within under Red Hat 7.1). That's why I decided 
to upgrade the complete Linux system - i.e. not just reinstalling it 
'from scratch'. The reason for that was I wanted to preserve my old
Netscape Messenger email directory tree etc). So, at first, I made cca. 
450 MB of free space on my / partition, hoping that would be enough to 
upgrade. But, RH 9.0's setup asked for even more 400 MB - that I couldn't
made. Then I tried to make a 'fresh' installation of RH 9.0 and it also
looked that I had better supply a larger hard disk (besides that,
it seemed that RH 9.0 performed a bit slower on my system than the old
RH 7.1). Finally, I made a decision to re-install RH 7.1 again.
</em>

<p>
After I did it, one of the first tasks to do was to install LinFBB. I
took some browsing in order to find something newer than that
<bf>fbbsrc.704h</bf> and I've got <bf>fbbsrc.704j</bf> <em>tarball</em> 
from <url url="ftp://www.f6fbb.org/pub/f6fbb/distrib/linux/src"
name="ftp://www.f6fbb.org/pub/f6fbb/distrib/linux/src">

<p>
<itemize>

<item>At first, I extracted <em>.tgz</em> package to the <bf>/usr/src</bf> 
      directory. <bf>fbbsrc.704j</bf> consists of 7 subdirs and 12 files.
      According to its <em>readme</em>, at the beginning I should 'goto fbbsrc/src 
      directory' so I went to <bf>/usr/src/fbbsrc.704j/src</bf>

<p>
<item>The <em>readme</em> also suggested to "update the variables" 
      at the beginning of <em>Makefile</em> files, but I just left 
      the file(s) intact.

<p>
<item>The next task was to run <em>make</em> command from the shell
      and it took almost two minutes to be finished. The result was new
      <em>xfbb</em> executables (clr_user, epurmess, epurwp, fbbgetconf, 
      maintinf, reqdir, xfbbC and xfbbd) that I quickly moved to
      <bf>/usr/sbin</bf> directory. 

<p>
<item>Then I copied <bf>fbb.conf</bf> (previously backup-ed) as well as
      other config stuff that should go to <bf>/etc/ax25/fbb</bf> directory. 
      I have <em>not</em> created new directories LinFBB should use as a 
      'normal' Linux-only BBS (a 'configuration tree', a 'utilities tree'
      and a 'data tree' - all of which suggested by /usr/src/fbbsrc.704j/FBBTREE
      file. If I haven't copied my backup-ed <bf>fbb.conf</bf> (that, in turn, has
      been configured to share config files with my WinFBB on a spare FAT16
      partition) and if I wanted to activate LinFBB's daemon <em>before</em>
      copying my particular <bf>fbb.conf</bf> - then I had to create those
      FBB-trees. In opposite, LinFBB couldn't run.

<p>
<item>Soon after, I tried to activate LinFBB's <em>daemon</em> and
      it seemed to work without visible difficulties (using a temporary home
      LAN with a laptop, I performed <bf>telnet xfbbd_IP_address 6300</bf>, from
      Windows' utility Command Prompt. It recognized the <em>daemon</em> 
      in a second and I've only noticed that there was no Protus password 
      utility running). The latter I solved by copying /var/ax25/fbb/protus/c_filter
      file to a location /usr/lib/fbb/filter and re-starting LinFBB. To make more
      tests, I have also installed <bf>xfbbW</bf> (Windows client for LinFBB). It 
      also worked fine.

<p>
<item>According the <em>readme</em>, the next task should be to 
      "compile the xfbbX client". That operation is to be performed from 
      a place called "fbbsrc/client" but the only sub-directory available 
      under <bf>/usr/src/fbbsrc.704j/src</bf> was <bf>X11</bf> subdir. 
      I went there, but <em>before</em> trying to activate <bf>make</bf>
      again, I also installed a couple of <bf>LessTif</bf> RPM packages
      of version 0.93.18-1 (lesstif, lesstif-mwm, lesstif-devel and lesstif-
      clients). In fact, I haven't had a version of Motif to be installed.

<p>
<item>Once again, I did not make "updates" related to <em>Makefile</em>
      paths and just tried to run <em>make</em> from the shell (for the 
      2nd time now). In a half a minute, I got two new executables:
      <bf>xfbb</bf> and <bf>xfbbX_cl</bf>. I also copied them to 
      <bf>/usr/sbin</bf> directory, accompanied with <bf>xfbbX</bf>
      shell script. The difference to the older version 704h was that 
      this time I haven't had to apply the GUI client executables from 
      an earlier version I have backup-ed previously. That means, I
      could be sure now that both <em>server</em> and <em>client</em>
      parts of LinFBB are of the very same version.

<p>
<item>Then I entered /usr/sbin/xfbbX and soon after XFBB Setup screen
      appeared, asking to enter the Callsign and Password. From the
      Help menu, I checked for About and Copyright and I was satisfied
      when noticed that it was 7.04j version of the Linux GUI client.

<p>
<sect1>fbbsrc.704j (using Red Hat 9.0)
<p>
2004-01-05

<p>
<em>Notice: Although I managed to compile all parts of the newest
LinFBB version, I was not so happy because my Linux platform was
still the old one: Red Hat 7.1 and I wanted to have 9.0 version.
That's why I started planning what to do with the things intended
to be backup-ed <em>before</em> the another fresh installation of
Linux. The main trouble were the existing Netscape 4.76 email 
folders, because it was obvious that the 4.76 directory structure 
greatly differ from Netscape 7.1 folder tree. In fact, a user of 
Netscape 4.76 email only has to make a backup copy of the hidden 
<bf>.nsmail</bf> directory that, in turn, has to be restored into 
the same location <em>after</em> the eventual next re-installation 
of the Red Hat 7.1 distribution. That is a simple task to do. But, 
the problem with newer Netscape 7.1 was that it has the different 
directory tree when compared to its predecessor, in addition to 
a slightly changed email structure. In fact, I tried to use Netscape 
4.76's <bf>.nsmail</bf> directory with the fresh Netscape 7.1 
installation and that just didn't want to run properly. Than I looked 
for another way to accomplish that task and here is how I did it.
</em>

<p>
I already knew that Netscape and Mozilla software (in particular
the newer one versions of them) converge in a way they seem to
use a similar or the very same "engine" as well as the directory
structure. Having in mind that the newer Red Hat 9.0 distribution
have <em>not</em> offered any version of Netscape software at all
and that Mozilla packages remained in the newer Red Hat's - I 
decided to perform the following steps:

<p>
1. to make a simple <em>upgrade</em> from Red Hat 7.1 to Red Hat 
9.0 (in order to keep the original Netscape's 4.76 <bf>.nsmail</bf> 
directory structure <em>intact</em>, but to get an up-to-dated 
version of Mozilla which comes with this particular Red Hat upgrade 
and that is the same as Mozilla after the 'fresh' installation 
of RH 9.0);

<p>
2. to make an <em>import</em> of the existing email from Netscape 
4.76 to Mozilla (interestingly, the new Mozilla only supports an
<em>import</em> from a "Netscape 4.x");

<p>
3. to make a <em>backup</em> copy of the new Mozilla's directory 
structure;

<p>
4. to make a <em>'fresh' installation</em> of Red Hat 9.0 (in order 
to ensure the stable environment that, in turn, will also have the 
same new Mozilla);

<p>
5. to make a <em>'restore'</em> of Mozilla's directory structure 
(previously backup-ed);

<p>
6. to <em>install</em> the new Netscape 7.1 that, as mentioned, will 
use the <em>same</em> directory structure as the new Mozilla;

<p>
7. to <em>have</em> a choice: to run either Netscape or Mozilla (if 
you get bored from either of them :-)).

<p>
Well, these steps were the nice mental exercise, but finally I got
them all running as I wanted. After I got sure that the Internet
email and browsing capabilities of my new Red Hat 9.0 became OK, I
got to the beginning of LinFBB installation procedure. Now I am not 
going to repeat the items from the previous LinFBB sub-section, but 
what I would like to say is that the step 4. (a couple of paragraphs 
above) have not brought some X Window development packages, needed 
for compiling of <bf>xfbbX</bf>. I mean, once again I managed to 
compile <em>xfbbd</em> and <em>xfbbC</em> without problems, but a 
<bf>make</bf> of xfbbX haven't produced the result I expected. In
fact, it returned something like this:

<p>
      <tscreen><verb>
[root@localhost X11]# make
gcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -g -funsigned-char  ...
In file included from ../../include/xfbb.h:34,

...
...

xfbbabtd.c: In function `DisplayInfoDialog':
xfbbabtd.c:428: warning: comparison between pointer and integer
make: *** [xfbbabtd.o] Error 1
[root@localhost X11]#
      </verb></tscreen>

<p>
I was advised by the friendly FBB-hams that obviously something of the 
X Window development stuff have been missing, so I started to explore 
the <em>RPM</em>'s I already have installed:

<p>
      <tscreen><verb>
[root@localhost root]# rpm -qa *lesst*
lesstif-devel-0.93.18-1
lesstif-clients-0.93.18-1
lesstif-mwm-0.93.18-1
lesstif-0.93.18-1
[root@localhost root]#
      </verb></tscreen>

<p>
<itemize>
      As long as I know, all these <em>lesstif</em> packages 
      don't belong to either Red Hat 7.1 nor 9.0 distribution.
      I have probably downloaded them as a '3rd party' software.
      Besides that, I also noticed that Red Hat 9.0 installation
      CD's do include the following: 
<p>
      <tscreen><verb>
      lesstif-0.93.36-3.i386.rpm
      lesstif-devel-0.93.36-3.i386.rpm
      openmotif21-2.1.30-8.i386.rpm
      openmotif-devel-2.2.2-14.i386.rpm
      </verb></tscreen>

<p>
<item>Well, a nice try to 'upgrade' to lesstif-0.93.36-3.i386.rpm 
      ended up with an error report on the conflicts with 
      the existing lesstif-0.93.18-1 - so I gave up;

<p>
<item>Then I entered a 'loop' of failed dependencies as follows:

</itemize>
<p>
      <tscreen><verb>
      lesstif-devel-0.93.36-3.i386.rpm required 
      XFree86-devel and lesstif = 0.93.36

      XFree86-devel-4.3.0-2.i386.rpm required
      fontconfig-devel and pkgconfig

      fontconfig-devel-2.1-9.i386.rpm required
      freetype-devel >= 2.1.2-7
      </verb></tscreen>
      
<p>
<itemize>
      Then the following stuff got installed without complaints:
<p>
      <tscreen><verb>
[root@localhost root]# rpm -i freetype-devel-2.1.3-6.i386.rpm
[root@localhost root]# rpm -i fontconfig-devel-2.1-9.i386.rpm
[root@localhost root]# rpm -i pkgconfig-0.14.0-3.i386.rpm
[root@localhost root]# rpm -i XFree86-devel-4.3.0-2.i386.rpm
      </verb></tscreen>


<p>
<item>Well, at this point I tried to recursively install 
      lesstif-0.93.36-3.i386.rpm <em>once again</em> but it 
      conflicted with the existing lesstif-0.93.18-1 - so I 
      gave up <em>once again</em>;

<p>
<item>While pulling out the remaining hair, I just tried another
      <em><bf>make</bf></em> within the X11 directory and ... 
      Bingo! ... <em>xfbbX</em> finally got compiled! Only God 
      knows which one of the packages above was/were the missing
      part(s). Case some of <em>you</em> knows, please let me
      know.

<p>
<item>And, as they said: ... and after all that had happened, 
      what remained has just gone to a legend ... :-)
      
</itemize>

<p>
What remains to be explored (at least for me) is to see how to 
maintain various sysop's tasks (ex. how to execute 'housekeeping' 
mechanism by a mouse click or like) - from within <em>xfbbX</em>.
Your suggestions are welcomed (they can be added as contributions
to the next releases of this mini-HOWTO!).

<p>
<sect1>fbbsrc.704o (using Mandrake 9.1)
<p>
2008-01-13

<p>
<em>Notice: I started to play with <em>Mandrake release 9.1 for
i586 (Bamboo)</em> some two years ago. That version was equipped
with kernel <bf>2.4.21-0.13mdk</bf> and, as you can expect, after
the installation of the new OS, I decided to put fbbsrc.704j on it
because I was familiar with version 7.04j. Unfortunately, in that
particular iteration I have only managed to compile the server
part of LinFBB (xfbbd) and despite my best efforts I couldn't have
produced the graphical client (xfbbX). As you have learned above
what I was experiencing with earlier LinFBB versions when I was
about to compile GUI clients, I tried to follow the same procedure
once again: I mean to ensure that Motif (LessTif) was there etc.
But whatever I tried to install/uninstall I haven't got any success
with the client. So, I ended up with running xfbbd v. 7.04j and
xfbbX v. 7.00g24 (dated Oct 16 1999) which was included in 7.04j
tarball. You can imagine that I was not happy with such confusing
situation, so I decided to try something that reached the markets
in Sep 2007: a new version 7.04o
</em>

<p>
Since the previous version I was using, it seems that LinFBB has
changed its maintainer, though I don't know if Bernard, F6BVP took
the 'job' from F6FBB officially or not. Regardless of that, I expected
to see some improvements in a way they constructed GUI clients to
make it easier to compile xfbbX - regardless a distribution of
Linux being used. This time I downloaded the package from F6BVP's
location: <url url="http://f6bvp.free.fr/logiciels/BBS-f6fbb/xd704o-src.tgz"
name="http://f6bvp.free.fr/logiciels/BBS-f6fbb/xd704o-src.tgz">

<p>
The procedure with xd704o-src.tgz is the same as it was with earlier
versions of LinFBB - so I am not going to replay how to compile the
executable files. A new fact for me was that the base directory tree
of LinFBB keeps changing (it started to change from version 7.04n).
Now, almost all parts of the program have to be placed in subdirectories
of <bf>/usr/local</bf> but at the first moment I missed that point.
To be precize, I was used earlier to put new executables into /usr/sbin
directory with other similar files, the configuration files into /etc, etc.
When I tried to activate xfbbd within the old locations, nothing happened so
I thought the compilation process might have failured. After recognizing
my mistake and moving the program parts in accordance with instructions
provided (always read the manuals!), another incarnation of LinFBB
<em>daemon</em> started to run immediately. To be honest, I haven't
noticed anything special with it, so I rushed to compile the client xfbbX.

<p>
By the way, besides the location I downloaded xd704o-src.tgz from, I also
noticed <url url="http://f6bvp.free.fr/logiciels/BBS-f6fbb/xd704o_i386.tgz"
name="http://f6bvp.free.fr/logiciels/BBS-f6fbb/xd704o_i386.tgz"> which I
supposed to be a version for older CPUs, like PI or PII. Instead, it
appeared that it was the complete structure of LinFBB's new directory
tree, including already compiled versions of xfbbd and other executables,
minus the client xfbbX - which found me a bit disapointed.

<p>
I did not have any option but to try compilation of xfbbX by myself. At
first, I tried to position myself to the proper location, as follows:

<p>
      <tscreen><verb>
[root@server src]# cd X11
      </verb></tscreen>

<p>
Then I invoked <em>make</em> command:

<p>
      <tscreen><verb>
[root@server X11]# make

<p>
Interestingly, I faced to the very same symptoms earlier when
tried to compile the GUI front-end of <bf>fbbsrc.704j</bf> where
all I managed to have was the following:

<p>
Then too I got no clues what was  caused the errors close to the end of
the sequence above and I would really appreciate if somebody would be
kind enough to give me some pointers. Actually, all 'make' tries just
haven't produced either xfbbX or xfbbX_cl files (or I happened not to
find them elsewhere?). The only idea I've got was just to try executing
(i.e. mouse clicking on) the original xfbbX <em>shell script</em> (dated
09/07/03) which resulted in opening XFBB's main GUI window, asking
for callsign, pasword etc. I am not so sure if things should have gone
that way, because as explained in earlier installations, I managed to
compile xfbbX and xfbbX_cl files, move them to /usr/sbin and activate from
there.

<p>
After some Internet searching for ideas, I got an email from VK5KMG:

<p>
"Hi there Misko, it might be more of a help if you included your complete
operating system,ie: computer,processor and so on.
As to the ax25 stuff you will need libax25-0.0.11 ax25-apps-0.0.6
ax25-tools-0.0.8.
You should be able to get rpm's of these.

Th original compile error was in regard to the updated ax25stuff wnerein
you will have to edit the necessary files to reflect the use of the later
versions,,,,,alternatively if you are using a 2.2 kernel ( though the later
updated stuff works quite ok on the earlier kernels) you would need the
ax25-utils package, then FBB would compile up ok using the earlier stuff.

To get the X stuff compiled you will have to go into the relative dir in
src and compile the files in there and install manually."

<p>
I have also downloaded the following versions of AX25 packages from
the Net:

libax25-0.0.11-1.i386.rpm
ax25-apps-0.0.6-178.i586.rpm
ax25-tools-0.0.8-324.i586.rpm

<p>
Although all three complained for bad file signatures or like, I
managed to install all of them. What followed a repeated 'make'
command, was the same failed output. For your information, I tried
to tweak appropriate Makefile file before doing <em>make</em> in
fbb/source/X11 directory, for several times now, but nothing helped.

<p>
According to earlier 'symptoms' of that type of an error, I was
suspicious that I have forgotten to install some parts of developing
software - related to graphical environment. In order to check what
actually was installed per default (Mandrake 9.1 distribution), I
did the following test:

<p>
      <tscreen><verb>
[root@localhost src]# rpm -qa *lesst*
lesstif-0.93.36-2mdk
[root@localhost src]#
      </verb></tscreen>

<p>
It was obvious that some of the X Window development parts of lestiff
routines were missing here. I started Mandrake 9.1 Control Center's
RpmDrake, searching there for possible lestiff-related packages and
found three of them. After having them installed, I performed another test:

<p>
      <tscreen><verb>
[root@localhost src]# rpm -qa *lesst*
lesstif-mwm-0.93.36-2mdk
lesstif-clients-0.93.36-2mdk
lesstif-0.93.36-2mdk
lesstif-devel-0.93.36-2mdk
[root@localhost src]#
      </verb></tscreen>

<p>
Then it seemed that I finally got all four parts of lestiff, but
regardless of that I was not able to compile the xfbbX client.

I would appreciate if someone has new pointers to solve this issue.

<sect>How to access the "xfbbd" server from a DOS client?

<p>
<em>Notice: In some of the previous chapters, I announced 
      my plans to use an old i286/12 MHz box,
      having only 1 MB of RAM, running DOS 5.0, as a
      'telnet client' computer. That box has a network
      card so I would like to 'connect' to the
      BBS from that one 'telnet client' box. If that
      succeeds, it would be a good preparation for
      installing another LinFBB (in the local school
      club), where several old 286 computers will be also
      available. It would be nice to offer more than
      one student-amateur the opportunity to 'connect' the
      BBS simultaneously, using a bunch of vintage
      'telnet client' DOS computers.</em>

<sect1>NCSA Telbin DOS client

<p>
2003-06-30

<p>
First of all, I have been looking for networking software that
does not require much of hardware resources. Several hams
keep advising me to try this or that way, but Jose, CO2JA,
sent me his distribution copy of <bf>NCSA Telnet</bf> utility.
According to its own <em>howto</em> document, that is
actually a <bf>"NCSA Telbin DOS client"</bf>, being "used 
at The University of Port Elizabeth  (Sep '94)". So far 
about software's earlier "official" usage.

<p>
Well, it seems that NCSA TCP/IP kernel only runs on packet 
drivers now. That's why I looked for appropriate packet drivers 
for my old ISA network card, equipped with the UMC's UM9003AF
chip. <bf>CZ20000.COM</bf> packet driver seemed to be the
most suitable one. 

<p>
Before implementing the driver I also needed the proper diagnostic 
utility to check and/or modify NIC's IRQ and I/O address in order to avoid 
possible hardware conflicts (you know, under DOS it is less easier 
to resolve interrupt hardware conflicts case a user has several ISA
cards that are not of P'n'P type /as PCI cards are/). It seemed that 
<bf>DIAG.EXE</bf> ("The Ethernet Adapter Diagnostic Program, 
Ver. 2.13" - that comes with E1000 and E2000 series Ethernet cards) 
was fully capable to handle my card's parameters, so I choose the 
values of IRQ 5 and I/O 320 that weren't occupied by other resources.

<p>
Then I could execute the following DOS command:

<tscreen><verb>
     cz2000 0x60 5 0x320
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
in order to activate the NIC.

<p>
Now the configuration file CONFIG.TEL should be modified 
in order to satisfy my particular needs, including local (DOS client) and 
remote (Linux server) IP addresses etc. In a couple of minutes 
that was finished so the main executable <bf>TELBIN.EXE</bf> 
successfully started running on my old 286 DOS box.

<p>
If you want, you may put <bf>cz2000 0x60 5 0x320</bf> and
<bf>telbin</bf> commands into a dedicated <em>TELNET.BAT</em> 
file in order to make your telnet utility easier to activate. Should
you plan to use your old DOS box for only accessing the
Linux FBB server, both lines may be added to the 
<em>AUTOEXEC.BAT</em> start up file.

<sect1>Xrouter 176b

<p>
2003-07-20

<p> 
A "YL" (the amateur "young lady") from the UK, Paula Dowie G8PZT, has
suggested me to try her own product, XROUTER MULTI-PROTOCOL 
ROUTER, that is "an AX25 and IP packet router for the amateur packet 
radio network, using a standard PC and DOS". Actually, it seems that 
Xrouter has much more functions that I need now, but anyway it was 
intriguing to test its features, in order to connect LinFBB via LAN. Paula 
said that "Xrouter <url url="http://pzt.org.uk/software/software.htm"  name=
"http://pzt.org.uk/software/software.htm"> will run on a 286 DOS machine, 
and will act as a telnet client". She added that, Xrouter's "outgoing text is 
composed in a one line buffer, so the receive window is only 22 lines".

According to Paula's email signature, seems she's very active in 
helping to the amateur digital radio activities:
 
      <tscreen><verb>

> HTTP:     http://g8pzt.ath.cx/ and http://44.131.91.245
      </verb></tscreen>

<p>
So, I went to visit the site to see what it was about and to download the 
package. There were two compressed files, rout172.zip and rout176c.zip 
so I decided to get both of them (the latter is the newer one, 28/7/02 but
the other one is also not so old, 15/11/01).

<p>
According to sysop's manual <bf>XROUTER.TXT</bf> the ethernet driver
allows connection with Windows, Linux, NOS and BPQ. At the moment I am
primarily interested in connections to LinFBB (and maybe to WinFBB too).
Xrouter's hardware requirements include at least one COM port or Ethernet 
card and I used only the Ethernet card for the first time because I am not
going to use Xrouter for anything else but for accessing LinFBB over my
home network.

As described in the previous section, related to "NCSA Telbin DOS client",
I have managed to activate my NIC using the command:

<tscreen><verb>
     cz2000 0x60 5 0x320
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
After doing that, there was a requirement to use the software component 
<bf>ETHDRV.EXE</bf> (supplied with Xrouter), like this:

<tscreen><verb>
     ethdrv 125
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
where "125" stands for a software interrupt in the range 60 - 127 (125 
is used as an example that, BTW, works here without any problem). On the 
other side, the same software interrupt must be defined as the INTNUM 
parameter, that is a part of the INTERFACE block within 
<bf>XROUTER.CFG</bf> configuration file.

<p>
And, finally, there was a command:

<tscreen><verb>
     xrouter
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
to activate the main executable. As mentioned before, all three lines above 
may be incorporated into an <em>XROUTER.BAT</em> (or whatever similar) 
batch file to make user's life easier.

<p>
Well, although in my case the first two lines responded in positive manner,
the last one rather suggested that I had some errors in the configuration.
The nice thing is that errors are reported with a detail such the exact line 
of <bf>XROUTER.CFG</bf> where an error is made. In fact, Xrouter is able
to support lots of various "ports" and has a plenty of other features, so it
was not easy to solve the config issues I faced to. With some help from 
other hams I managed to adapt the following configuring blocks:

<tscreen><verb>
INTERFACE=8
    TYPE=EXTERNAL
    PROTOCOL=ETHER
    MTU=1600
    INTNUM=125
ENDINTERFACE
</verb></tscreen>

and

<tscreen><verb>
PORT=6
    ID=Ethernet LAN
    INTERFACENUM=8
    CHANNEL=A
    FRACK=1000
    RESPTIME=200
    MAXFRAME=7
    PACLEN=240
ENDPORT
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
So far, so good. Now I got Xrouter's main screen from where I could enter
telnet and other commands. But I was still not able to connect to the LinFBB.
Finally, I got the suggestion to reconfigure another Xrouter's system file, 
<bf>IPROUTE.SYS</bf>. It seemed that the missing part was to change the
default route, as follows:

<tscreen><verb>
route default 6 * d
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Then I became capable to access my LinFBB server.

<sect1>JNOS 1.11f

<p>
2007-04-09

<p>
Similarly to Xrouter, JNOS is much more than a simple 'telnet client'
for DOS machines. And yes, its telnet ability is fine so I use it to
make casual connections to my LinFBB server without problems.

<p>
On the other side, I always wanted to offer a 24/7 mailbox service to
the radio amateurs in my area. Having in mind that the computer
the LinFBB server runs on is everything but a brand new machine, and
if it failured I would stay without my primary working computer, I
started thinking to use the old 80286 box as a full-time mailbox. In
fact, JNOS might be one of the best solutions for that:

<tscreen><verb>
     - It provides complete mailbox operations for incoming users,
     - It supports low-end computers, like my 80286 with 1MB RAM,
     - It supports mail forwarding with LinFBB servers, including
       forwarding over Ethernet,
     - etc.
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>Plans

<p>
Here it is a diagram of my planned ham radio systems:

<tscreen><verb>

     ---------------------------              -------------------------------

</verb></tscreen>

<p>
The idea was to use the 286 box as a 24/7 amateur radio mailbox. The
local users would connect to the mailbox using their VHF stations. While
logged, they are offered to read bulletins that have been supplied
by the LinFBB machine. In addition, users can sent replies to the bulletins'
authors as well as to write other personal emails. JNOS is planned to run
24/7 which means its services would be available regardless the LinFBB
computer is active or not.

<p>
Having in mind that LinFBB is just one of the applications I use when
working with the P II computer, and the fact that I don't have enough
resources to finance some better equipment, I found it as rational to
use LinFBB only when really needed - including forwarding purposes.
That means, the local packeteers would have no problem if the P II
computer is off while I am at work or something. The 286 box is going
to provide all mailbox services.

<p>
When I return home from work and switch the LinFBB server on in order to
exchange the content of its mailbox with remote BBS stations using 'telnet
forwarding' via the Internet, it would establish another 'telnet
forwarding'session - this time with JNOS mailbox added. Of course, in that
case I would need to keep my dial-up connection to the Internet alive as
long as the content of the LinFBB mailbox is exchanged with remote servers.
The telnet sessions within the home LAN (Ethernet) can take as much time as
needed and during those sessions LinFBB and JNOS mailboxes would exchange
both bulletins ('SB' messages) and personal stuff ('SP' messages).

<sect2>Realization

<p>
I have already had a version of JNOS which was dated somewhere in mid-nineties.
First of all, I searched the web in order to learn how things changed during
the last decade and, as a result, I discovered that the last version of JNOS
'family 1.xx' was 1.11f - for which I have even found the installer package.
So I downloaded and installed it - though I was not sure which options were
activated ("defined" in the JNOS jargon) and which were not ("undefined").

<p>
According the instructions, I ensured that my network card's driver was started
before any part of the JNOS program itself. It is important because at the
early stages of JNOS booting process, the JNOS ports are configured, including
the port which uses the network card. So, I managed to set up two ports:

<tscreen><verb>
     - A port that provides radio access using TNC2 in KISS mode,
     - A port that provides telnet access using the network card.
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
The first tests of the equipment proved that both radio and telnet outlets
were working, but nothing was considered as finished until the JNOS system
was capable to exchange the content of its mailbox with the LinFBB server.
Having in mind that the LinFBB server's telnet port has been in use for a
long time now, I just set up another forwarding 'partner' that was JNOS.
The same I did at the JNOS side, though it was a tricky business because
I was used to configure FBB systems and haven't handle any JNOS system
since the early nineties. So far - so good.

<p>
Unfortunately I faced to the issues I heard of for several times: Telnet
is not the best option to make a forwarding between FBB and JNOS. In fact,
there is no complete technical description of that behavior available,
but what happens is that both FBB or JNOS somehow do not understand
what the other party 'wants to say'. To be precise, during the so called
handshaking part of the session, both systems have to exchange their
'flags' which are [JNOS-1.11f-BFHIM$] in JNOS and [FBB-7.04j-ABFHM$] in
FBB. Whatever happens during that telnet session, often the result is a
broken link.

<p>
After making several tests without much success, I had to subscribe to a
couple of mailing lists and asked for help. The majority of hams suggested
to use an AXIP connection instead of telnet. Frankly speaking, I heard of
the AXIP and AXUDP connections long ago, but I haven't learned much of
them because I did not need them at the time. In short, AXIP (or AXUDP)
are used to 'encapsulate' the usual radio traffic of the AX.25 type into
the internet-like TCP/IP packets. When you have such encapsulated packets
of data, it is easy to transfer them using the wired links - including the
Internet or the Ethernet in my case. More details on how to configure AXIP
(or AXUDP) you can find in another document: AX.25 howto.

<p>
The good thing is that Linux has a 'native' support for the amateur radio
networking, which means you do not have to install some "node" or "switch"
software that is used as an interface between LinFBB server computer and
other amateur radio mailbox systems (more details about the specific setup
in my case will follow in the next versions of this document). The good
thing at the JNOS side is that it also does not need a "node" or "switch"
software that runs bellow the JNOS software itself. That means both LinFBB
and JNOS system operators ('sysops' in the ham terminology) are required
just to activate and configure native AXIP or AXUDP features of their mailbox
systems. In opposite to that, WinFBB (FBB for Windows) sysops have to
install additional "node" or "switch" packages, called BPQ or others.

<p>
After some fine tuning and additional 'tweaking' the LinFBB and JNOS
systems, I am capable to exchange the amateur radio messages between the
two mailboxes. Of course, the experimentation is far from over, because
there are several minor issues to work on. Stay tuned ...

<sect1>Improving the home LAN connections

<p>
2007-11-17

<p>
As mentioned earlier, I had an old NIC of ISA type equipped with UMC's
UM9003AF chip in the DOS computer. On the Linux/Windows side I also used
an ISA card which was activated with either module 'ne' in Linux, and was
recognized as 'NE2000 compatible' in Windows 2000. For some unknown reason
the card was not recognized by Windows XP at all. A friendly ham Paul,
N6RME, wanted to donate his spare card of PCI type, equipped with 3Com's
3C905 chip. I decided to move 'NE2000 compatible' ISA card from Linux to
DOS machine because I expected not to have problems with its DOS drivers.
Besides that, that NIC also had a UTP connector - just like the 'new'
3Com's card, sent by Paul, which meant I could replace the old coax cable
with a UTP (FTP) one. So I did.

<p>
With the new card at the Linux/Windows side, I started with configuration.
W2k recognized the NIC as 3Com Ethernet Link XL 10/100 PCI NIC (3C905-TX)
at I/O address of E400 and IRQ 7, while XP recognized it as 3Com 3C905TX
at the same address of E400 but IRQ 5. Linux Mandrake 9.1 has found it as
3c905 100BaseTX [Boomerang]. At the first moment I wanted to continue with
using the module 'ne' but obviously it was not possible and I got an error
message when re-booted Linux. Then I tried to tweak the I/O and IRQ's in
Linux with using 'netconf' tool but always got an error. I have also tried
to change a value within the computer's BIOS from 'Legacy ISA' to 'PCI/ISA
PnP' because the new card is PCI and accordingly not likely to work with
settings for earlier ISA card. It did not help, until I replaced the module
'ne' with module '3c59x'. It seems to run fine for now, though it makes me
wonder if there might be a more proper "3c90x" module to play with.

<p>
To be honest, I haven't improved the link between the two so much (if any)
- it still runs as a 10 Mbps link because of the slower 'NE2000 compatible'
card at the DOS side. But, with upgrading the cables to a newer standard I
increased the chances for further options: To include those two computers
in some more complex home LAN, using a hub or a switch.

SC <broj> <CALL> kopira poruku <broj> za <CALL>. Na pr. dvojici primalaca ide 
                 isti tekst. Pre CTRL-Z mozete dopisati neki komentar, a 
                 kopija poruke <broj> se sama dopise posle tog komentara.

To je moguce u svim varijacijama (@EU, @YUG, @WW, @YU7 itd.).

@@ 14 T

Naredba T trazi od BBS-a da pozove SysOp-a na razgovor. Nema nikakvog 
argumenta, samo T <enter>. Ukoliko SysOp nije prisutan ili se ne javi 
na poziv u roku od 1 minuta, dobijate informaciju da mu ostavite poruku.

@@ 14 TH

Izlistava poruke slozene po temama, ranije podesenim u BBS-u.

Na pr. sve poruke, poslate za OS2, DOS, NT4 i sl. mogu da budu u temi OPSISTEMI.

Moguce naredbe su:

H (list themes) - popis tema u bbs-u,
L (list)        - listanje poruka o izabranoj temi,
R msg# (read)   - procitaj poruku broj <msg#> u izabranoj temi,
broj            - idi na teme <broj>.


@@ 14 U

Naredbom U mozete da posaljete neki tekst fajl u BBS. Sintaksa je kao
i kod MS-DOS. Pogledajte i pomoc za D i W naredbe (? D ? W).

@@ 14 V

Naredba V daje kratku informaciju o porukama, verziji BBS programa itd.

Takodje moze da radi i kao naredba R za citanje poruka. Tada prikazuje 
zaglavlja sa putanjama i usputnim bbs-ovima, pa pravi daleko veci ispis.

@@ 14 W

Naredba W je nesto kao DIR ili CAT naredba. Dobijate spisak svih fajlova
i direktorijuma koji su na raspolaganju korisnicima. Vaze sva MS DOS
pravila. Primeri:

W
W *.DOC
W \IBM\*.*

@@ 14 WP

WP je interni server BBS-a. To je velika baza podataka o korisnicima stvorena 
bilo direktnim upisom podataka od strane samih korisnika, bilo analizom svih
zaglavlja koja prate svaki bilten/poruku. WP sadrzi podatke o pozivnom znaku,
imenu korisnika, postanskom broju i "home"-BBS-u sa H-adresom.

Ukoliko je WP aktivan, mozete bilo kome poslati licnu poruku iako ne znate 
koji je njegov "home"-BBS. Ukoliko server ima tu informaciju, sam ce je 
dodati, ako je (ponekad) nema - trazice od vas da adresu sami unesete.

Sa bilo kojeg BBS-a, mozete WP serveru poslati pitanje o nekom korisniku:

Naredba: SP WP @BBS  (@BBS zamenite sa znakom BBS-a sa kojeg zelite odgovor),
Naslov:  unesite neki tekst (nebitno, napr. Info)
Tekst:   YU1A ?      (napr. trazite info o YU1A)
/EX ili CTRL-Z

Takodje je dozvoljeno koristiti i dzokere pa mozete traziti info za 
na pr. sve stanice sa prefiksom YT:

YT* ?

Napomena: da bi se smanjio QRM, odgovor ce imati maksimalno 100 redova, bez
obzira koliko ima pravih informacija.

U vezi sa ovim, pogledajte i pomoc za I naredbe (? I).


@@ 14 X

Naredba X prebacuje vas korisnicki status iz "normal" u "expert" i obrnuto.

Status "normal" daje kompletniji i opsirniji odgovor od BBS-a, 
Status "expert" daje kratki i sazetiji odgovor od BBS-a.       


@@ 14 Y|YAPP|YW|YI|YN|YU|YD|YZ

Sve naredbe koje pocinju slovom Y rade binarni transfer fajlova pomocu tzv.
YAPP protokola.

YW       lista direktorijum programa,
YN       lista "novitete" od poslednje upotrebe naredbe YN,
YU fajl  ubacuje - snima fajl u BBS,
YD fajl  salje vam - "skida" file iz BBS-a,
YI       kao i YW, samo dobijate i kratki opis programa,
YI fajl  daje kratku informaciju o fajlu (ako je upisana kod unosa fajla),
YZ fajl  brise fajl.

YAPP mogu koristiti samo vlasnici racunara sa programom koji sadrze i
taj protokol. Na pr za PC :YAPP, THS, TPK, modifikovani SP, s tim da bi trebalo
upotrebiti prg koji podrzava tzv. RESUME mod. To znaci da kad se veza prekine, 
dodjete opet i nastavite tamo gde ste stali. Takvi su prg: TPK, ZACC, PTM,
AUTOYAPP itd.

YAPP se takodje moze upotrebiti iz FbbDOS-a, ali su onda druge naredbe.

@@ 14 Z

Naredba Z brise fajl iz BBS mod-a.

@@ 14 >

Znak > omogucuje da nekom drugom ko je takodje prisutan u BBS-u, posaljete 
kratku poruku (jedan red). Nesto kao "Break" u fonijskoj vezi. Primer:
> YT7MPB Hi OC ! Pozovi me kad zavrsis !

Napomena: pre naredbe > pogledajte koga jos ima u BBS-u naredbom !

@@ 14 =

Znak = daje mogucnost da stupite (kroz BBS) u direktnu vezu s nekim ko je

<sect>How to make better ham radio rules?

<p>
2003-10-26

<p>
<em>Notice: Gentle folks, here I am going to discuss some
rules'n'regulations issues that we, radio amateurs, face to
every day. These problems make rather significant obstacles 
for this nice alternative way of communication to be more 
developed and more widely used.</em>

<p>
First of all, anybody who might be interested in
running Linux amateur radio software, as a way of
using radio amateur stations on the international
HF waves, in a <em>digital</em> manner, has to learn
<bf>manual <em>analog</em></bf> Morse telegraphy and
pass the similar <bf>manual</bf> Morse skill test. For a long 
time now, I have been trying to explain myself, why manual
Morse telegraphy is still being kept as the legal requirement
without an amateur is not allowed to use HF radio frequencies
under 30 MHz, in order to contact Linux and other remaining
<bf><em>digital</em></bf> radio amateurs world-wide. I still 
have no answer to that question, except that all of those who 
have wasted lots of time learning Morse, now don't want to 
allow newcomers to use the same capabilities - but without 
the same (useless) test!

<p>
You all know, there are so many Linux enthusiasts world-wide
(including myself) who have been fighting against all types
of <bf>monopols</bf> (like a company from Redmond, USA). 
The Morse obligatory test is the same: just another type of a
<bf>monopoly!</bf>

<p>
That's why I have been trying to persuade all relevant
authorities to <bf>remove</bf> such outdated regulatory
principles, that make more and more obstacles for not
only Linux users, but for other kinds of computer users
- when it comes to the modern ICT technologies. I hope,
all of you, readers of this mini-HOWTO, can understand 
now what does it mean to use outdated rules and regulations
endlessly . For example, I often contact various people from 
the academic world, either students or scientists,
in order to motivate them to join amateur radio wireless
activities. They mostly refuse to think about the amateur
(also called <em>"ham"</em>) radio, as soon as they hear they
have to pass the Morse test, as the legal requirement
<em>before</em> they become allowed to connect to
remote <bf>computing</bf> radio users world-wide, using 
the HF radio bands and devices. 

What I am sure, the absence of those high educated people within 
the digital ham radio is one of the most negative consequences in the 
ICT areas today!

<p>
I have been thinking what to do since the early ninetees,
when I was the secretary of <em>YU7</em> (Vojvodina
province in Serbia) amateur radio union. It seemed to
me that it was a very hard task to persuade the people who govern
the amateur radio organizations, to remove such outdated rule.
When I realized that removing the mandatory manual Morse
test seemed to be almost impossible to be expected in a short period of 
time, I decided to suggest the implementation of another regulatory 
principle. It should be a major innovation: To make a new type of the 
amateur radio license, a <bf>H</bf>am <bf>D</bf>igital <bf>L</bf>icence 
(the <bf>HDL</bf> in short). The HDL licensees would be allowed to use 
<em>all</em> amateur radio frequencies, including <em>all</em> 
international HF bands under 30 MHz. But, they rather should be allowed 
to use <em>only</em> <bf>digital</bf> sub-bands and types of the 
amateur radio emissions a.k.a. "modes", including the usage of computers, 
equipped with the LinFBB packet radio software. Besides that, the HDL 
holders may only use modified and/or dedicated radio transmitters, 
without the capability for both voice microphone and Morse key
connections, in order to avoid possible misuse of unwanted amateur 
activities (like voice SSB operations).

<p>
All HDL candidates should have to learn topics like computer hardware 
and software in general (operating systems and system software 
configuration, amateur radio software setup etc), connecting the amateur 
radio stations to the computers (connecting radio modems to the 
transmitters etc), building simple antennas (like 1/2 wave wire dipole for 
20m that I used long ago), the English language (or German etc) in the 
written exam etc. The Morse requirement would not be used anymore, 
as well as some other obsolete tests, like highly complicated radio
circuits or skills needed for building home-brew radios from the scratch 
(instead of buying modern factory manufactured devices). Of course,
the regulatory issues should also be tested (like band plans - in particular
recognizing the sub-bands dedicated for <bf>digital</bf> ham radio). Next
are RFI issues and how to avoid them etc.

<p>
I believe that amateur radio <em>digital</em>
activities have their future only if we all do
our best to improve the regulatory principles that
govern this fine hobby. You should also know that, 
besides the telegraphy skill requirement for an HF access, 
here in Serbia we have some further restrictions: we all
have to be the members of the national amateur radio 
unions (SRV union in YU7 province and SRS union in Serbia in whole), 
as the legal requirement, <bf>before</bf> we become allowed
to use <em>any</em> type of the amateur radio activities.
Such a nonsense does not exist elsewhere! 

<p>
Should you want help us to adopt internationally known
principles, that do NOT require to join <em>any</em>
type of the amateur radio organizational system, i.e. the 
amateur radio society (that only wants to get our membership
money), you are invited to lobby for us. Our conservative
amateur society leadership also has their email address:
yu0srj@eunet.yu (I suppose they may have more than
one email address, but you may try to use this one).
You may also use an Internet search engine and scan for 
information related to "Savez radio amatera Jugoslavije" and
"Savez radio amatera Srbije". Your help would be highly 
appreciated. Case you need more info regarding our national
legal issues, do not hesitate to contact me.

<p>
If you find yourself interested enough in making
amateur radio rules and regulations better and more
updated (say to spread the idea of liberalize the whole
ICT areas and make them free of any kind of monopols),
I would suggest you to look for your national radio
amateur society and/or national telecommunication
regulatory agency (like FCC in the USA). Lobby to them 
in order to remove the obsolete manual Morse proficiency 
test. In addition, should you have some opportunities to
attend to some ICT meetings and conferences or 
something like that, you are also invited to let me know.

<p>
Case we all do our best to remove obstacles mentioned above
and allow the new people, who may wish to enjoy the amateur
radio digital and Linux-related operations, to do so, the technology 
would become the part of more homes. I hope you, the readers, 
may help. So I look forward to hear from you soon!

<em>Notice: I often participate in various (inter)national ICT
conferences in Serbia and abroad, presenting technical papers and
delivering half-day and full-day tutorials, covering basic ideas
and useful mission of the amateur radio hobby and its possible
usage in engineering education. What I have been doing is to spread
- as much as possible - the knowledge about existing open source
products, including Linux and amateur radio free software. Besides
that, I have been writing various articles for a variety of scientific
and other magazines. Here you have the list of those articles and
paper topics submitted to the conferences.</em>

<p>
In case you want to re-publish or forward my volunteer paper 
works to some journals or other public media around, you are 
free to contact me. Some of my papers are written in Serbian 
Cyrillic, some of them are in English and some of them even 
combined!

Besides the published articles and presented works, I am also a member 
of the following associations: IEEE Computer Society, IEEE Communications
Society, WSEAS and ACM. In addition, I work on establishing an academic 
computer network that would use the amateur radio stations as the media. 
Some kinds of proposed networks exist elsewhere on this planet and I 
invite their administrators to contact me in order to cooperate.

<nidx>disk!information resources!HOWTOs</nidx>
These are intended as the primary starting points to
get the background information as well as show you how to solve
a specific problem.
Some relevant HOWTOs are <tt/Bootdisk/, <tt/Installation/,  <tt/SCSI/ and <tt/UMSDOS/.
The main site for these is the
<url url="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/"
    name="LDP archive">
at Metalab (formerly known as Sunsite).

<sect1>Mini-HOWTO
<p>
<nidx>disk!information resources!mini-HOWTOs</nidx>
These are the smaller free text relatives to the HOWTOs.
Some relevant mini-HOWTOs are
<tt/Backup-With-MSDOS/, <tt/Diskless/, <tt/LILO/, <tt/Large Disk/,
<tt/Linux+DOS+Win95+OS2/, <tt/Linux+OS2+DOS/, <tt/Linux+Win95/,
<tt/Linux+WindowsNT/, <tt/Linux+NT-Loader/, <tt/NFS-Root/, 
<tt/Win95+Win+Linux/, <tt/ZIP Drive/, <tt/FBB packet-radio BBS/ etc.
You can find these at the same place as the HOWTOs, usually in a sub directory
called <tt/mini/. Note that these are scheduled to be converted into SGML and
become proper HOWTOs in the near future.

<sect1>Local Resources
<p>
<nidx>disk!information resources!local</nidx>
In most distributions of Linux there is a document directory installed,
have a look in the
<htmlurl url="file:///usr/doc"
    name="/usr/doc"> directory.
where most packages store their main documentation and README files etc.
Also you will here find the HOWTO archive (
<htmlurl url="file:///usr/doc/HOWTO"
    name="/usr/doc/HOWTO">)
of ready formatted HOWTOs
and also the mini-HOWTO archive (
<url url="file:///usr/doc/HOWTO/mini"
    name="/usr/doc/HOWTO/mini">)
of plain text documents.

Many of the configuration files mentioned earlier can be found in the
<htmlurl url="file:///etc"
    name="/etc">
directory. In particular you will want to work with the
<htmlurl url="file:///etc/fstab"
    name="/etc/fstab">
file that sets up the mounting of partitions
and possibly also
<htmlurl url="file:///etc/mdtab"
    name="/etc/mdtab">
file that is used for the <tt/md/ system to set up RAID.

The kernel source in
<url url="file:///usr/src/linux"
    name="/usr/src/linux">
is, of course, the ultimate documentation. In other
words, <em>use the source, Luke</em>.
It should also be pointed out that the kernel comes not only with
source code which is even commented (well, partially at least)
but also an informative
<url url="file:///usr/src/linux/Documentation"
    name="documentation directory">.
If you are about to ask any questions about the kernel you should
read this first, it will save you and many others a lot of time
and possibly embarrassment.

Also have a look in your system log file (
<htmlurl url="file:///var/log/messages"
    name="/var/log/messages">)
to see what is going on and in particular how the booting went if
too much scrolled off your screen. Using <tt>tail -f /var/log/messages</tt>
in a separate window or screen will give you a continuous update of what is
going on in your system.

You can also take advantage of the 
<htmlurl url="file:///proc"
    name="/proc">
file system that is a window into the inner workings of your system.
Use <tt/cat/ rather than <tt/more/ to view the files as they are 
reported as being zero length. Reports are that <tt/less/ works well here.

<sect1>Web Pages
<p>
<nidx>disk!information resources!WWW</nidx>
<nidx>disk!information resources!web pages</nidx>
There is a huge number of informative web pages out there and by their very
nature they change quickly so don't be too surprised if these links become
quickly outdated.

A good starting point is of course the
<url url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/"
    name="Linux Documentation Project"> home page, or this one: <url 
url="http://www.tldp.org/"
name="Linux Documentation Project">,
an information central for documentation, project pages and much, much more.

Please let me know if you have any other leads that can be of interest.


<sect>Getting help

<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!assistance, obtaining</nidx>

In the end you might find yourself unable to solve your problems and need
help from someone else. The most efficient way is either to ask someone
local or in your nearest Linux user group, search the web for the nearest
one.

Another possibility is to ask on Usenet News in one of the many, many
newsgroups available. The problem is that these have such a high
volume and noise (called low signal-to-noise ratio) that your question
can easily fall through unanswered.

No matter where you ask it is important to ask well or you will not be
taken seriously. Saying just <it/my disk does not work/ is not going
to help you and instead the noise level is increased even further and if
you are lucky someone will ask you to clarify.

Instead describe your problems in some detail that
will enable people to help you. The problem could lie somewhere you did
not expect. Therefore you are advised to list up the following information
on your system:

<descrip>
<tag/Hardware/
<itemize>
<item>Processor
<item>DMA
<item>IRQ
<item>Chip set (LX, BX etc)
<item>Bus (ISA, VESA, PCI etc)
<item>Expansion cards used (Disk controllers, video, IO etc)
</itemize>

<tag/Software/
<itemize>
<item>BIOS (On motherboard and possibly SCSI host adapters)
<item>LILO, if used
<item>Linux kernel version as well as possible modifications and patches
<item>Kernel parameters, if any
<item>Software that shows the error (with version number or date)
</itemize>

<tag/Peripherals/
<itemize>
<item>Type of disk drives with manufacturer name, version and type
<item>Other relevant peripherals connected to the same buses
</itemize>

</descrip>

Remember that booting text is logged to <tt>/var/log/messages</tt> which can
answer most of the questions above. Obviously if the drives fail you might not
be able to get  the log saved to disk but you can at least scroll back up the
screen using the <tt/SHIFT/ and <tt/PAGE UP/ keys. It may also be useful to
include part of this in your request for help but do not go overboard, keep
it <em/brief/ as a complete log file dumped to Usenet News is more than a
little annoying.
