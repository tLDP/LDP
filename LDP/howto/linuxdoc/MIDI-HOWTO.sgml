<sect>Background to MIDI.
<p>

MIDI is a set of hardware and software protocols used by electronic musical instruments to communicate.   It was first released in 1982 and has become the de-facto communication standard between electronic musical instruments.  The protocol specifies the physical hardware parameters for the cable and interfaces, and provides a well defined set of communication protocols to exchange musical and timing data.

Prior to MIDI there were several analogue, and later basic digital, connection protocols.  The earliest, circa. 1974, would transmit note information as a voltage though a wire from one keyboard to another.  Later, 1980 - 1981,  Roland created a basic digital protocol.  The MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA), working with the equipment manufacturers, defined a standard protocol and physical connection which allowed equipment from all complying manufacturers to connect and communicate with each other.

>From 1985 MIDI interfaces started to appear on home computers and soon after sequencing programs appeared.


<sect>Configuring MIDI devices.
<p>

<sect1>Configuring and debugging<p>

MIDI devices can be integrated into the soundcard or be a separate device.  External MIDI interfaces may be attached to either the serial or USB port.
<p>
The first *and most important* thing you should do is check if your card is supported!
<p>

<p>
<url url="http://www.4front-tech.com/osshw.html">

Configuring MIDI devices varies with Linux distributions.  At it's most simplest a well supported card may be configured when you install the OS.   

The Linux Kernel includes the OSS drivers, although some distributions use Alsa, and most distributions provide a configuration tool (mostly for soundcards, but if you are using the MIDI port of a sound card it should be configured).  Under RedHat you would use sndconfig, under SuSE yast, and Mandrake, DrakConf. 

If none of the above tools will configure your MIDI interface, or you are experiencing problems, the following steps should be taken:

Does lsmod show any MIDI related modules?  Here's a typical output.
<code>
[root@mega /root]# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
lockd                  32208   1  (autoclean)

</code>

Look for mpu401, olp3, uart401 and oss.  

If you are using USB devices don't forget to check if the USB modules are there.


To check the config cat the sndstat file:

<code>
[root@mega /root]# cat /dev/sndstat 
OSS/Free:3.8s2++-971130
Load type: Driver loaded as a module
Kernel: Linux mega 2.2.17-21mdk #1 Thu Oct 5 13:16:08 CEST 2000 i686
Config options: 0

Installed drivers: 

Card config: 

Audio devices:
0: MAD16 WSS (82C930) (DUPLEX)

Synth devices:
0: Yamaha OPL3

Midi devices:
0: Mad16/Mozart

Timers:
0: System clock

Mixers:
0: MAD16 WSS (82C930)
</code>

We see here that the MIDI device is a mad16 and this is listed in the lsmod output above.


If you see nothing related to MIDI check the contents of your /etc/modules.conf file.

<code>
[root@mega /root]# cat /etc/modules.conf
alias net-pf-4 ipx 
pre-install pcmcia_core /etc/rc.d/init.d/pcmcia start 
alias usb-interface usb-ohci 
alias parport_lowlevel parport_pc 
alias block-major-11 scsi_hostadapter 
pre-install plip modprobe parport_pc ; echo 7 > /proc/parport/0/irq 
alias scsi_hostadapter ide-scsi 
alias eth0 eepro100 
alias eth1 hisax 

#---- Soundcard
    alias sound-slot-0 mad16 
    options sound dmabuf=1 
    alias midi opl3

    options sb support=1 
    options mad16 io=0x530 irq=5 dma=0 dma16=1 mpu_io=0x300 mpu_irq=7 joystick=1
</code>

Here's the output of /proc/modules to check to see if the MIDI modules are loaded into the Kernel.

<code>
[root@mega /proc]# cat modules

You should see something similar to the above.  If not you'll need to install MIDI drivers.

If you are going to be using ALSA divers, I suggest a good read of Valentijn Sessink's Alsa-sound-mini-HOWTO which can be found at the link below:

<url url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/Alsa-sound.html">


<sect1>Latency.<p>

MIDI is a real-time protocol and latency issues are a serious problem. 

There are now several developers working on improving the latency times and improvements in the Kernel are making Linux a fine platform for MIDI.

Although stock Linux distributions may run fine, pro set-ups should apply low-latency patches.  More information can be found here:

<url url="http://www.gardena.net/benno/linux/audio/">

<sect>Software.
<p>

Interest in Linux based MIDI is growing and this list will probably not reflect the true amount of MIDI software available, but should provide a reasonable selection of applications.<p>
If you are developing, or know of, any other MIDI apps not listed here please drop me a note.<p>

<sect1>Drivers<p>

<sect2>Alsa Driver<p>

The Advanced Linux Sound Architecture is composed of several parts. The first is a fully modularized sound driver which supports module autoloading, devfs, isapnp autoconfiguration, and gives complete access to analog audio, digital audio, control, mixer, synthesizer, DSP, MIDI, and timer components of audio hardware. It also includes a fully-featured kernel-level sequencer, a full compatibility layer for OSS/Free applications, an object-oriented C library which covers and enhances the ALSA kernel driver functionality for applications (client/server, plugins, PCM sharing/multiplexing, PCM metering, etc.), an interactive configuration program for the driver, and some simple utilities for basic management. 

<url url="http://www.alsa-project.org/">

<sect2>OSS<p>

OSS provides sound card drivers for most popular sound cards under Linux and FreeBSD. These drivers support digital audio, MIDI, synthesizers, and mixers found on sound cards. These sound drivers comply with the Open Sound System API specification. OSS provides a user-friendly GUI which makes the installation of sound drivers and configuration of sound cards very simple. It supports over 200 brand name sound cards, and provides automatic sound card detection, Plug-n-Play support, support for PCI audio soundcards, and support for full duplex audio.

<sect1>Development<p>

<sect2>sfront<p>

Sfront compiles MPEG 4 Structured Audio (MP4-SA) bitstreams into efficient C programs that generate audio when executed. MP4-SA is a standard for normative algorithmic sound, that combines an audio signal processing language (SAOL) with score languages (SASL, and the legacy MIDI File Format). Under Linux, sfront supports real-time, low-latency audio input/output, local MIDI input from soundcards, and networked MIDI input using RTP and SIP. A SIP server hosted on the Berkeley campus manages sessions. The website includes an online book about MP4-SA. 

<url url="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~lazzaro/sa/index.html">

<sect2>jMax<p>

jMax allows one to interactively design dataflow circuits. The basic data types that can go through are integers, symbols, lists, etc. It is an event-driven system and has been used for MIDI processing. A second part of the system (DSP) allows a continuous signal to flow through a circuit, which is most useful for PCM sound (ie. microphone, sound files, etc). The system is extensible by using shared libraries, you may add data processor types, data types, GUI elements, device types, and more. Data processors may also be designed as circuits and reused. 
<p>

<url url="http://www.ircam.fr/equipes/temps-reel/jmax/">

<sect2>TSE3
<p>

TSE3 is a powerful open source sequencer engine written in C++. It is a 'sequencer engine' because it provides the actual driving force elements of a sequencer but provides no form of user interface.  Sequencer applications or multimedia presentation packages will incorporate the TSE3 libraries to provide a user with MIDI sequencing facilities.

<url url="http://TSE3.sourceforge.net/">

<sect2>KeyKit
<p>

KeyKit is a multi-tasking interpreted programming language (inspired by awk) designed exclusively for realtime and algorithmic MIDI manipulation. KeyKit's GUI provides several dozen tools for algorithmic music experimentation, including a multi-track sequencer and drum pattern editor. The GUI and all tools are completely written in the KeyKit language itself. This allows users to add new tools and operations to the existing tools, even while the system is running.

<url url="http://nosuch.com/keykit/">
