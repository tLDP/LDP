<sect> Introduction

<sect1> Knowledge Required
<p>
With all the help from major Linux distributions such as SuSE, Redhat, Caldera and many others, Linux based systems are becoming easier to use.  However, there is still some need of understanding of basic UNIX skills to make the most of Linux.  Thus, this HOWTO will assume that the reader has at least a basic knowledge of using a UNIX system including the ability to compile and install programs.

A few resources we have found useful over the years include:

<itemize>
<item> "A Practical Guide to the UNIX System", Mark G. Sobel
<item> "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment", the late W. Richard Stevens
<item> "Running LINUX", Matt Welsh et al.
<item> "LINUX Device Drivers", Alessandro Rubini
</itemize>

Similarly, this is not a tutorial or reference for astronomy principles or astronomical instrumentation. Astronomy is perhaps the grandest of all sciences, employing widely disparate disciplines in a bold attempt to understand nothing less than the universe itself. Your interests will lead in many directions. A few references we have used include:

<itemize>
<item> "Astronomy with your Personal Computer", Peter Duffett-Smith
<item> "Astronomy on the Personal Computer", Oliver Montenbruck et al
<item> "Textbook on Spherical Astronomy", W. M. Smart
<item> "The Astronomy and Astrophysics Encyclopedia", Stephen P. Maran, ed.
</itemize>

<sect1> Scope
<p>
The authors define the scope of this HOWTO as primarily an index to Linux tools applicable in some fashion to the pursuit of Astronomy. It is NOT our intention to list WWW astronomy references in general. Our own interests tend more towards the technology than the pure science and so we welcome contributions from others who have found Linux tools which contribute in other ways to Astronomy. Please contact us at the address above.

Here is discussion of whole programs for use in finding objects, natural and man-made, in the sky which run on Linux.

<p>
<itemize>
<item> <htmlurl url="http://clearskyinstitute.com/xephem" name="XEphem"> has been the pet project of one of us (Downey) for the past 15-odd years. It has grown to become one of the more capable interactive tools for the computation of astronomical ephemerides.
</item>

<item> <htmlurl url="http://www.astrotrf.net:8080/xsky_blurb.html" name="XSky"> is by Terry R. Friedrichsen, terry@venus.sunquest.com. XSky is essentially an interactive sky atlas.
</item>

<item>
<htmlurl url="http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/skymap.html" name="Skymap"> is an astronomical mapping program written in Fortran and C for unix workstations by Doug Mink of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Telescope Data Center.
</item>

<item>

The yearly <htmlurl url="http://hea-www.harvard.edu/adass" name="Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems, ADAAS,"> Conference Series provides a forum for scientists and computer specialists concerned with algorithms, software and operating systems in the acquisition, reduction and analysis of astronomical data.  The program includes invited talks, contributed papers and poster sessions as well as user group meetings and special interest meetings ("BOFs'').  All these activities aim to encourage communication between software specialists and users, and also to stimulate further development of astronomical software and systems.

<sect> Hardware Control
<p>
More folks are using Linux to control equipment.  Users range from amateur astronomers in the field to professional observatories.

<sect1> Telescope Control
<p>
<itemize>

<item>
<htmlurl url="http://www.torusoptics.com/OCAAS.htm" name="OCAAS"> is a complete Observatory Control and Astronomical Analysis System for Linux.

<sect> Installation Help
<p>
You need to know what you're doing with Linux and installing programs, but help is available for some programs.  Here are some ways to make life easier.

<itemize>

<item>
<htmlurl url="http://bima.astro.umd.edu/nemo/linuxastro/astromake/" name="AstroMake">
is is a utility intended to make installations of some common astronomical packages (in binary form) easy.
</item>

<item>
XEphem requires several elements to exist on your machine.  Life is much simpler with the CDROM version of the program as it contains an installation script which loads the appropriate precompiled binary for most systems and places all auxiliary files to the correct spots. See <htmlurl url="http://www.clearskyinstitute.com/ecommerce/xephem/order.html" name="XEphem CDROM">
</item>

</itemize>

<sect> Projects using Linux
<p>
Here is a list of astronomy projects using Linux in whole or in part of their instrumentation:

<itemize>
<item>
