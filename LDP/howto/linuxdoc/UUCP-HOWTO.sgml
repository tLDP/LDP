<nidx>UUCP</nidx>
This document describes the setup, care &amp; feeding of UUCP under Linux.

You need to read this if you plan to connect to remote sites via UUCP via a
modem, via a direct-connection, or via Internet.

You probably do *not* need to read this document if don't talk UUCP or if you
don't know what it means.

<toc>

<sect>Introduction, copyright &amp; standard disclaimer<p>

<sect1> Email &amp; spamming <p>

First, convert all "at" in Emails addresses given in this document into
"@".

It's simple for humans, but not for bots searching the web to spam ; therefore
it's enough to protect generous contributors from being spammed.

<sect1> Goals <p>

The intent of this document is to answer some of the questions &amp; comments
that appear to meet the definition of "frequently asked questions" about UUCP
software under Linux genrally &amp; the version in the Linux Debian and
RedHat distributions in particular.

<sect1> New versions <p>

New versions of this document will be periodically posted to
comp.os.linux.announce, comp.answers &amp; news.answers.  They will also be
added to the various anonymous ftp sites who archive such information
including <url name="sunsite FTP"
url="http://sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO">.

In addition, you should be generally able to find this document on the
Linux WorldWideWeb home page at <url name="the LDP page"
url="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/">.

<sect1> Feedback <p>

I am interested in any feedback (please e-mail), positive or negative,
regarding the content of this document.  Definitely contact me if you find
errors or obvious omissions.

I read, but do not necessarily respond to, all e-mail I receive.  Requests for
enhancements will be considered &amp; acted upon based on that day's combination
of available time, merit of the request &amp; daily blood pressure :-)

Flames will quietly go to /dev/null so don't bother.

Feedback concerning the actual format of the document should go to the HOWTO
coordinator: Greg Hankins (<tt>gregh at sunsite.unc.edu</tt>).

<sect1> USENET <p>
<nidx>UUCP!information resources!newsgroups</nidx>

There is nothing "special" about configuring &amp; running UUCP under
Linux (any more).  Accordingly, you almost certainly do *NOT* want
to be posting generic UUCP-related questions to the comp.os.linux.*
newsgroups.

Don't post in comp.os.linux hierarchy unless it's really linux specific, for
example: "What's wrong with Debian 1.2 uucp?" or "RedHat 5.0 uucp crashes
when I run it" ...

Let me repeat that.

There is virtually no reason to post anything uucp-related in the
comp.os.linux hierarchy any more.  There are existing newsgroups in the
comp.mail.* hierarchy to handle *ALL* your questions.

<em>
IF YOU POST TO COMP.OS.LINUX.* FOR NON-LINUX-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS, YOU ARE
LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR HELP.  THE UUCP EXPERTS HANG OUT IN THE PLACES
INDICATED ABOVE AND GENERALLY DO NOT RUN LINUX.
</em>

<em>
POSTING TO THE LINUX HIERARCHY FOR NON-LINUX-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS WASTES YOUR
TIME AND EVERYONE ELSE'S AND IT FREQUENTLY DELAYS YOU FROM GETTING THE ANSWER
TO YOUR QUESTION.
</em>

The GOOD PLACE is <tt>comp.mail.uucp</tt> since you can get answers for most of
your <idx>UUCP questions</idx>.

<sect1> Mailing Lists <p>
<nidx>UUCP!information resources!mailing lists</nidx>

There is a <idx>Taylor UUCP mailing list</idx>.

To join (or get off) the list, send mail to

<sect1> Other documents from LDP <p>
<nidx>UUCP!information resources!HOWTOs, related</nidx>

There is plenty of exceptional material provided in the other Linux HOWTO
documents &amp; from the Linux DOC project.

In particular, you might want to take a look at the following:

<itemize>
<item>on your own computer in /usr/doc/uucp &amp; /usr/info/uucp* :-)
<item>the Linux Networking Administrators' Guide
<item>the Serial Communications HOWTO
<item>the Ethernet HOWTO
<item>the News HOWTO
<item>the Mail HOWTO
</itemize>

<sect1> Books <p>
<nidx>UUCP!information resources!books</nidx>

HDB &amp; V2 versions of UUCP are documented in about every vendor's
documentation as well as in almost all *nix communications books.

Taylor config. files are currently only documented in the info files provided
with the sources (&amp; in your distribution hopefully). 
The following is a non-inclusive set of books that will help.

<itemize>

<item> <tt>"Managing UUCP &amp; USENET"</tt> from O'Reilly &amp; Associates is in my
opinion the best book out there for figuring out the programs &amp; protocols
involved in being a USENET site.

<item> <tt>"Unix Communications"</tt> from The Waite Group contains a nice
description of all the pieces (&amp; more) &amp; how they fit together.

<item> <tt>"Practical Unix Security"</tt> from O'Reilly &amp; Associates has a
nice discussion of how to secure UUCP.

<item> <tt>"The Internet Complete Reference"</tt> from Osborne is a fine
reference book that explains the various services available on Internet &amp; is
a great source for information on news, mail &amp; various other Internet
resources.

<item>"<tt>The Linux Networking Administrators' Guide</tt>" from Olaf Kirch of
the Linux DOC Project is available on the net &amp; is also published by (at
least) O'Reilly &amp; SSC.  It makes a fine <em>one-stop shopping</em> to learn
about everything you ever imagined you'd need to know about Unix networking.
</itemize>

<sect>Requirements<p> 
<nidx>UUCP!requirements</nidx>

<sect1> Hardware <p>
<nidx>UUCP!requirements!hardware</nidx>

There are no specific hardware requirements for UUCP under Linux.
Basically any Hayes-compatible <idx>modem</idx> works painlessly with UUCP.

In most cases, you'll want the fastest modem you can afford, i.e. 56000 bps
actually.  In general, you want to have a 16550 UART on your serial board or
built into your modem to handle speeds of above 9600 baud.

If you don't know what that last sentence means, please consult the
<em>comp.dcom.modems</em> group or the various fine modem &amp; serial
communications FAQs &amp; periodic postings on USENET.

<sect1> Software <p>
<nidx>UUCP!requirements!software</nidx>
 
UUCP for linux is available everywhere, for example on sunsite.unc.edu.
But before trying to get any version, try to install &amp; make your current uucp
work ; there're many little differences between each linux distribution,
therefore it's easier for you to configure/install your distribution's UUCP
package rather than editing sources for some options, setting the right 
paths &amp; permissions, installing, etc.

But if you prefer sources ...

<p> 1) Unpack <p>

To extract a gzip'd tar archive, I do the following:
<verb>
                gunzip -c filename.tar.z | tar xvf -
</verb>
A "modern" tar can just do a:
<verb>
               tar -zxvf filename.tgz
</verb>

<p> 2) Run "configure" <p>

Type <tt>"sh configure"</tt>.

The configure script will compile a number of test programs to see what is
available on your system &amp; will calculate many things.

The configure script will create <tt>conf.h</tt> from conf.h.in &amp;
<tt>Makefile</tt> from Makefile.in.  It will also create config.status, which
is a shell script which actually creates the files.

<p> 3) Decide where to install <p>

Rather than editing the Makefile.in file in the sources you can get the same
effect by:

<verb>
        "configure --prefix=/usr/lib"
</verb>

<p> 4) Edit "policy.h" for your local system <p>

<itemize>
<item> - set the type of lockfiles you want (HAVE_HDB_LOCKFILES) 
<item> - set the type of config files you want built in
		(HAVE_TAYLOR_CONFIG, HAVE_V2_CONFIG, HAVE_HDB_CONFIG)
<item> - set the type of spool directory structure you want
		(SPOOLDIR_HDB)
<item> - set the type of logging you want (HAVE_HDB_LOGGING)
<item> - set the default search path for commands
		(I added /usr/local/bin to mine)
</itemize>

<p> 5) Then compile &amp; install the software <p>

<itemize>
<item>Type <tt>"make"</tt> to compile.
<item>Type <tt>"make install"</tt> to install.
</itemize>

<sect>Setting up the config files<p>
<nidx>UUCP!config files</nidx>

I recommend you start by installing the attached known-good config. files
included in the document.

<sect1> Installing config. files <p>
<nidx>UUCP!config files!installing</nidx>


Put these file in their "standard" location: <tt>/etc/uucp</tt> on recent
linux distributions or <tt>/usr/lib/uucp</tt> on older ones.

Then make sure that the <tt>permissions</tt> of the files are

<tscreen><verb>
(guylhem@barberouge:uucp)$ ls -l

(guylhem@barberouge:uucp)$
</verb></tscreen>

To change file owner, as root, type:
<tscreen><verb>
(root@barberouge:uucp)$ chown uucp.uucp *
</verb></tscreen>

Then you must change file permissions; as root once again, type:
<tscreen><verb>
(root@barberouge:uucp)# chmod 640 *
(root@barberouge:uucp)# chmod +r Poll sys
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1> <idx>"Poll" file</idx> <p>
<nidx>UUCP!config files!poll file</nidx>

This file is used to set polling timetables for any system.

<tscreen><verb>
schedule polux 01
poll     polux 01
</verb></tscreen>

My machine calls polux at 01:00, that's all!

You can add more line if you must call many other machines, but don't forget to
put the 2 lines (schedule &amp; poll) for each.

<sect1> <idx>"call" file</idx> <p>
<nidx>UUCP!config files!call file</nidx>

It contains your login/password for each system you poll:
<tscreen><verb>
polux uudan password
</verb></tscreen>

My machine uses "uudan" login &amp; "password" password :-) when it polls "polux".
 
As for Poll, adapt this to your situation.

Here just replace "barberouge" by your system name ; run "hostname" if you
can't remind it.

Syntax is complicated ... you'd rather not touch anything here but "ATZ" &amp;
"ATX4" which are my modem init string.

<nidx>UUCP!config files!passwd file</nidx>

<tscreen><verb>

</verb></tscreen>

If you allow uucp dialin, just add system/passwords in this file.

It's *that* simple.

But it's recommended for security reasons to make sure each have a separate
account &amp; home directory so you can track things.
 
<sect1> <idx>"port" file</idx> <p>
<nidx>UUCP!config files!port file</nidx>

<tscreen><verb>
# Description for the modem entry

# Description for the TCP port - pretty trivial. DON'T DELETE.
# Change service number if non standard, cf /etc/services

# Description for the nullmodem entry

port nullmodem

</verb></tscreen>

You shouldn't change anything here ... except your modem port.

On recent distributions with mgetty, it's <tt>/dev/ttySN</tt> while on older
distributions it's <tt>/dev/cuaN</tt>, where N is you serial port:

N starts at 0 &amp; ttyS(N) means COM(N+1), for example, my null-modem is on ttyS1
(COM2) while my modem is on ttyS0 (COM1).

Most of recent modems support hardware flow control, if your doesn't, just
uncomment the line "&num; hardflow n".

Here, you must change "polux" by the name of the system you poll &amp; "0111111110"
by its phone number.

"polux-2", "polux-tcp" &amp; "horizon" are just examples of user specific needs ;
if the system you poll has more than one line, define it as "itsname-2" ; if
you call it by PPP sometimes, just define "itsname-tcp" also.

It's useful when chat script fail (busy ...)

to check if all the informations you've set are correct.

Warning: your mileage may vary ; different distributions use different
paths, regardless Linux FSSTD!

If everything is correct, run:

<tscreen><verb>
	/usr/sbin/uucico -r 1 -x 9 -s remote_system_name
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt>-x 9</tt> will have maximum debugging information written to the
<tt>/var/log/uucp/debug</tt> file for help in initial setup. 

I normally run <tt>-x 4</tt> here since that level logs details that help me
with login problems.
Obviously, this text contains clear informations from your systems file
(account/password) so protect it against world-read.

<sect1> Additional informations <p>
<nidx>UUCP!information resources</nidx>

>From <em>Pierre.Beyssac at emeraude.syseca.fr</em>
<p>
Taylor has more logging levels.  Use -x all to get the highest level possible.

Also, do a <tt>"tail -f /var/log/uucp/debug"</tt> while debugging to watch
things happen on the fly.

<sect>It doesn't work - now what?
<p>
<nidx>UUCP!troubleshooting</nidx>
In general, you can refer to the documentation mentioned above if things don't
work.

You can also refer to your more experienced UUCP neighbors for help.
Usually, it's something like a typo anyway.

<sect>Frequently Asked Questions about Linux UUCP
<p>
<nidx>UUCP!frequently asked questions (see UUCP, FAQ)</nidx>
<nidx>UUCP!FAQ</nidx>

<sect1>Why is all the info here for UUCPs configured in "Taylor" rather than
"HDB" mode?
<p>
<nidx>UUCP!FAQ!Taylor versus HDB mode</nidx>
(religious mode on - I know some people are just as religious about "ease
of use" as I am about "being standard".  That's why they make source code you
can build your own from :-) )

Because IMHO it's the de-facto standard UUCP implementation at this time.
There are thousands of sites with experienced admins &amp; there are many places
you can get incredibly good information concerning the HDB setup.

Moreover, if you know what HDB is, you shouldn't be reading this HOWTO :-)

Use the <tt>uuconv</tt> utility in /usr/sbin to convert config files from
one mode to another.

<sect1>Why do I get "timeout" on connections when I upgraded to uucp-1.04?

<itemize>
<item> from <em>Ed Carp - erc at apple.com</em> 
<p>
If you use a "Direct" device in the Devices file, there's now a
10 second timeout compiled in.  Make the name of the Device anything
other than "Direct".  If you tweak the example /etc/uucp files
provided, you won't have problems with this one.

<item> from <em>Greg Naber - greg at squally.halcyon.com</em> 
<p>
If you get chat script timeouts, you can tweak the sources by 
editing at line 323 in uuconf/syssub.c &amp; changing the default
timeouts from 10 seconds to something larger.

<item> from <em>Ed Rodda - ed at orca.wimsey.bc.ca</em>
<p>
If you get chat script timeouts, typically connecting to other
Taylor sites, a pause after login can fix this.

<sect1>Why doesn't HDB anonymous uucp seem to work?
<p>
<nidx>UUCP!FAQ!HDB anonymous uucp failure</nidx>
Taylor in HDB mode seems to be sensitive to white space &amp; blank lines.
To be safe, make sure that there are no blank lines or trailing spaces in the
Permissions file.

Lastly, make sure that you have a file called <tt>remote.unknown</tt> in
/usr/lib/uucp or /etc/uucp &amp; that it's <em>*NOT*</em> executable.

See the O'Reilly &amp; Associates book <tt>"Managing UUCP &amp; USENET"</tt> for
details regarding this file.

<sect1>What does "no matching ports found" mean?
<p>
<nidx>UUCP!FAQ!no matching ports error</nidx>
In all probability, you are attempting to use a dialer that doesn't exist, or
the dialer you've specified in the port files doesn't match up with any
valid devices in the dial file.

<sect1>What are known good config files for HDB mode?
<p>
<nidx>UUCP!FAQ!config files, known good</nidx>
The following are "known-good" config files for Taylor 1.05 under Linux in
HoneyDanBer mode.  They work on kernels of 0.99-8 or later. All files should
be in /usr/lib/uucp or /etc/uucp unless you've tweaked the sources to put the
uucp library elsewhere.

If you *HAVE* put things in non-standard places, be aware that things like
sendmail might get very confused. You need to ensure that all
communications-related programs agree on your idea of "standard" paths.

<sect1>Getting uucico to call alternate numbers
<p>
<nidx>UUCP!FAQ!uucico calling alternate numbers</nidx>
The new v1.05 has an added '-z' switch to uucico that will try alternate
numbers for a remote system.

You can else use Taylor mode &amp; "systemyouarecalling-2" (see "sys" in config.
files section for more details)
