<sect>Foreword
<sect1>Introduction
<p>
<bf>
NOTE: I write the document to help novices. However, if it didn't, that's 
<em/your/ problem, not <em/mime/! Don't complain that I WASTE your time,
because nobody has to answer your questions, and nobody has to write documents
to help you! You have been warned.
</bf>

This is a document, as a part of <ref id="CLDP" name="Chinese Linux Documentation Projects">, introduces the progress in fulfilling Chinese on Linux.
The special point different from the other CLDP documents is that this HOWTO document, in turn, will be the first one and also <em/the only/ one written in Chinese first and then translated into English later.^_^

I have been made my best effort to ensure the exactness of this document, though; however, I couldn't give a guarantee for myself that all the operations and configurations can execute exactly and smoothly on your system. If any problems or losses have happened to your own system because of the executable examples issued in this document, which you have been followed, the authors, us, <em/won't/ be in charge of any responsibility.

The basic purpose carried with this document is to enormously reduce the questions repeated again and again, just like "Why can't I input/see Chinese?", "Why can't I set xxx up?" and so forth, occurred on Internet.
In fact, it is impossible as I knew it...

<sect1>Awareness
<p>
The shell program used in this document will be sh/bash. If other system(such as csh/tcsh) is your choice, you need to pay attention to the differences amongst them. On the configuration of environment variables, for instance, usage for sh/bash will be,
<tscreen><verb>
# export TERM=vt100
</verb></tscreen>

whereas for csh/tcsh ,
<tscreen><verb>
# setenv TERM vt100
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Goal
<p>
I wish this document can offer a complete and self-sufficient explanation in the aspect of using Chinese on Linux system. What matters concerned with implementations of Chinese on Linux will put it all together here!
However, limited to the intelligence and private ability, the ultimate goal of my willingness is almost a "mission impossible"; therefore, if there are losses or drawbacks in it, please let me know it.

<sect1>Acknowledgement
<p>
I want to thank to Hong Zhang &lt;<htmlurl url="mailto:zhangh@earthlink.net" name="zhangh@earthlink.net">&gt; for being the original founder of this Chinese HOWTO document and for his papers of being the foundation of this new version. 
Also, I need to thank to Cd Chen &lt;<htmlurl url="mailto:cdchen@linux.ntcic.edu.tw" name="cdchen@linux.ntcic.edu.tw">&gt; for completing the section<ref id="view" name="Display and Input Chinese">.

The translator, Frank_J.S._Chen &lt;<htmlurl url="mailto:frank63@ms5.hinet.net" name="frank63@ms5.hinet.net">&gt;, also deserved the acknowledgments for translating this document into English.

Here, there are many people ought to be acknowledged much better for the reasons of devoting their efforts to make Linux more reliable in Chinese. Because of their hard works, we can nowadays enjoy ourselves on a comfortable Chinese environment of Linux.

<sect1>Words from The Translator--Frank J.S. Chen
<p>
This work begins on 1/8/98 and ends on 1/11/98, which I call the version of 0.1, as I always did for the initial states of anything. I appreciate the hard work of Chinese version  for its delicate statements and not leaving out any detail in the field of Chinese practices. The more I translated, the more I learned.
After examining all the sentences I've made, there are definitely many of them won't like real American-English, or the so called Chinese-styled English. Well, if you are skilled in this field of translation or are interested in the circle of computers science, anything about this English article, just like grammar, writing, internationalization of locale with Linux, translation, programming with C/C++, and so forth, will be sincerely grateful and excessively welcome, too.(1/11/98, modified on 6/2/98)
This is the secondary modification of it, focusing on the falses of typing, incorrect grammar, and correcting the meanings of ambiguous words(maybe a little research on sematics, just for this document:-)). I have no ideal about the translating quality of this paper, if you feel something strange or ill while reading, please let me know about it in my real heart. Pointing out the bad parts will be marvelous in spreading out this howto. 
As far as I know, English version of it had been translated into several foreign languages including Japanese, Swedish, etc. If you want to do another one, just go ahead, but we suggest you to inform anyone of us about that.(6/2/98)

<sect>Difficulties of Using Chinese on Linux System
<p>
This section makes an attempt to do a general description for the possible obstacles in using Chinese on Linux; then you could find the key points out much easier as you meet with these problems. As a matter of fact, the shortcomings described here not only appear on Linux but also the other system. Even more, we can say that the whole computers environments are concerned. If this section is not suited for your tastes or you are eager to act directly, then you can jump onto the section<ref id="view" name="Display and Input Chinese">!

A Chinese word is composite of two bytes in computers, as we all know. The most popular encoding methods includes BIG5 codes available in the area of Taiwan and GB codes available in the mainland China. The first byte of each word is almost bigger than numeric values 128, which is what we called the non-ASCII codes.(The ASCII codes means codes smaller than 128.)

Yes! Then so what? Here are the points! Because of different kinds of reasons, in the early days, many programs didn't consider the possibility of non-ASCII codes as a part of entering data.

These kinds of programs always assume that the data prepared to manipulation are all limited in the range of ASCII codes, and the most worst is that when they meet with non-ASCII codes, an assumption of their non-existence and a truncation of the 8th bit is the most frequent method they took.
This is the so called 8-bit clean problem. 

Your program, for example, always take it for granted that your inputs are all the 7-bit-width ASCII codes. When you enter Chinese words, it will erase the 8th bit so that the inputs under circumstances of Chinese will become disturbed codes all the way.

Communication programs on Internet are usually could only transmit 7-bit data. A notorious substance is the earlier <tt/sendmail/ program.
<tt/sendmail/ could only send and receive 7-bit mails, causing that the strategies of many odd encoding methods, <ref id="procmail" name="Encoding"> which made the receivers an excessive disturbance, are recognized as sending out Chinese mails(like uuencode, base64, QP and so on).
(Frequently, I thought by myself that if the founders of emails could have put much foresight on it, then we could have little problems nowadays perhaps.)

This problem seems to be more complicated on Internet. Even you and your receivers all have the machines installed with <tt/sendmail/ program which might manipulate with Chinese mails, the receiver might get disturbed mails in any way.
This is because this mail before its arrival at the target may travel over several hosts settled on Internet, if one of the hosts' <tt/sendmail/ cuts the 8th bit off, then things go down.
For the programs with the architecture of client/server, the problem may be on the end of client, or on the end of server; otherwise both of them are.  

Applications which are incapable of identifying the Chinese encoding are also a major problem, apart from being unable to deal with non-ASCII codes' data. That is, most programs(even if they can deal with 8-bit data accurately) all take a Chinese word as two individual bytes. This won't cause problems under some conditions, but it will show an unfortunate disaster under some spots.

The most obvious matter is that, for instance, even if you can input Chinese words properly, but when you hit the backspace key a time trying to delete a complete word, the whole word will be split into wto parts meaning that only one byte(column) can backspace on monitor and the redundant half one then become a disturbed code.
More over than that, you might change new line at the second byte of a Chinese word in some text editors and then disturbed codes occurred. Besides, these text editors might think that a long Chinese sentence as a long English sentence without changing to a new line, making the picture of screen ugly and chaotic.

There are more worse matters, too ! Some Chinese words contain special codes which correspond to some particular meaning for some applications and might make these programs producing severe faults while meeting with that codes or just collapse. 

Here below will try to propose some resolved methods but segmental, incomplete and also unsatisfactory.
Only when all softwares can fit with Chinese, then the problems could really resolve  perhaps.

However, more and more programs have noticed the significance of internationalization, for example, most hosts' <tt/<ref id="sendmail" name="sendmail">/ programs now can cope with 8-bit mails exactly --- Not only transmitting Chinese mails need 8-bit, but also many multi-media mails need 8-bit.
<ref id="other" name="Lots of softwares"> already don't need to modify at all or just open some special options for the purpose of using Chinese. 
Simultaneously, there are more and more persons devoting to the birth of Chinese softwares. Let's us wait and expect for it.

<sect1>Using Archie
<p>
There are usually some ordinary questions such as "Where can I find xxx...?" appeared on Internet. Actually, there was an excellent utility named archie could help you to search softwares you needed. Make a link to<htmlurl url="http://archie.edu.tw/archie.html" name="http://archie.edu.tw/archie.html">, and then enter the name of softwares that you want. 
If you have a desire to use <tt/xcin/, for instance, just input xcin can you get all these softwares concerned with xcin displayed on screen. Then, choose the nearest site to download those softwares. More illustrations in detail can be found on the archie's homepage for self-reference.

You can use text mode, too.
<tt/telnet archie.edu.tw/
and login as <tt/archie/,
then type <tt/prog FILENAME/ and press ENTER key, for instance,
<tscreen><verb>
Archie > prog xcin-2.1d.tar.gz
# Search type: sub.
# Your queue position: 1
# Estimated time for completion: 5 seconds.

<sect>Display and Input Chinese<label id="view">
<p>
For environments of Chinese system under DOS or of Windows 95 for Chinese that you have been always using to get through Linux hosts, there is no doubt that you don't need to take a good look at this section. However, when your local host is Linux-based system, configurations for Chinese system are definitely necessary.
<!----------          by Cd Chen            ---------->
<sect1>xcin+crxvt
<p>
It is truly suggested that you can take the combinations of xcin and crxvt as a pathway to solve the problems of Chinese I/O if the X Window System is acquainted with you.

Xcin, with a contraction of X Window Chinese INput, is a Chinese Input System executed under the X mode. Because xcin is utilizing the architecture of client/server, all you have to do is just to start one xcin window so that you can manipulate with many crxvt virtual terminals under the same window, which can exhaust much little  resources. 
Also, it offers some wise programs of input, like Wang-Hsing Input or Natural Input, which can select the matching phases by themselves. In the early age, in order to convert fonts and inputs table to fit with xcin, you need the ETen Chinese System mounted first before the installation of xcin. After the man, Tung-Han Hsieh, &lt;<htmlurl url="mailto:thhsieh@twclx.phys.ntu.edu.tw"name="thhsieh@twclx.phys.ntu.edu.tw">&gt; became responsible for the voluntary maintenance of xcin, this terrible problem had been resolved!

The newest version is 2.3.02 now. But this one is just a version of beta. For the more stable one, I advise you to fetch the xcin-2.1d for a suggestion in my mind.

<sect2>Getting the software
<p>
Download the sources of xcin from this ftp site below:
<quote>
<htmlurl url="ftp://linux.cis.nctu.edu.tw/packages/chinese/xcin/xcin-2.1d.tar.gz" name="ftp://linux.cis.nctu.edu.tw/packages/chinese/xcin/xcin-2.1d.tar.gz"><newline>
<htmlurl url="ftp://linux.cis.nctu.edu.tw/packages/chinese/xcin/xcin-2.3.02.tar.gz" name="ftp://linux.cis.nctu.edu.tw/packages/chinese/xcin/xcin-2.3.02.tar.gz">
</quote>

<sect2>Installation of xcin
<p>
You need the xcin-2.3.02.tar.gz file at hand first to setup xcin of version 2.3.02 and untar and unzip it under any certain directory.
<tscreen><verb>
# tar xzvf xcin-2.3.02.tar.gz
....
# cd xcin-2.3.02
# ./configure (Follow the instructions on screen to modify the options you picked up in turn.)
# make
# make install
</verb></tscreen>

So, you have finished the setup of xcin of version 2.3.02 from now on.

You can also get the same sort of xcin, named xcin-2.3.02.i386.rpm, maintained by Cd Chen for RedHat Linux System.

</quote>

Install it by
<tscreen><verb>
# rpm -Uvv xcin-2.3.02-3.i386.rpm
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>yact
<p>
yact is the system of displaying and inputing Chinese running under the terminal mode. The most different point from chdrv is that yact uses your computers' displaying card through svgalib library. Without the information of your video card contained in the svgalib, you may not probably make yact work on your Linux.

The most admirable point for yact is that the fonts are scanned with 24x24 on the monitor and are more beautiful than other terminal Chinese input system. And it is more smooth than the others in dealing with scrolling pages. The newest version of yact is yact-p4 now.

You can get yact here below,
<quote>
<htmlurl url="ftp://linux.cis.nctu.edu.tw/packages/chinese/yact/yactp4.tar.gz" name="ftp://linux.cis.nctu.edu.tw/packages/chinese/yact/yactp4.tar.gz">
</quote>
The ways to setup yact are simple, too. After getting the sources of yact, decompress it and examine whether the Makefile file is correct or not, then type make all install directly on shell prompt to complete the installation of bits files.
Read the README file for more detailed information.

Next is the step of fonts' setup. yact uses the HBF fonts, but you can't find the fonts in the packages of yact, which means you need to take extra actions to make it available. Having ETen Chinese System mounted is an original recommendation from the founder for its fonts. Copy the HBF fonts' description file <tt/et24.hbf/ under the fonts directory of sources of yact to the directory <tt>/usr/local/lib/yact</tt> and rename it as <tt/hzfont.hbf/. Then copy STDFONT.24, SPCFSUPP.24, SPCFONT.24 and ASCFONT.24 fonts files to the directory <tt>/usr/local/lib/yact</tt> and rename ASCFONT.24 as <tt/12x24/. 

The free HBF fonts are available, too. Change names of these 256 ASCII fonts as <tt/12x24/ and names of the HBF fonts' description file as <tt/hzfont.hbf/. Put both of description files and fonts files into <tt>/usr/local/lib/yact</tt>, then everything will be ok.

<sect1>bcs16
<p>
Because yact needs the svgalib 1024x768 mode to work, many netters without ET4000 series cards cannot get well supports from it, causing their sickness of this excellent Chinese system.
The bcs16 is modified from yact according to this drawbacks. It needs only 640x480 and can work very well on most video cards.

Get bcs16 from this site: 
<quote>
<htmlurl url="ftp://linux.cis.nctu.edu.tw/packages/chinese/bcs/bcs007a.tgz" name="ftp://linux.cis.nctu.edu.tw/packages/chinese/bcs/bcs007a.tgz">

Installation
<itemize>
<item>Decompress and compile it to setup
<verb>
# tar zxvf bcs007a.tgz 
# cd bcs16
# make
# cp bcs16 /usr/local/bin
</verb>
<item>bcs16 take yact's input table as default and this is the reason that you must setup yact first before bcs16 can work. However, version of v0.05 or laters have been emerged with the support of individual Boshiamy input, so if you don't need other inputs provided from yact, you don't need to install yact first.
Just fetch Boshiamy input table, <tt/liubig5.tab/, of DOS version and put it into the directory
<tt>/usr/local/lib/yact</tt> .
<item>Put files under directory <tt/data/ into <tt>/usr/local/lib/yact</tt> and all the legal fonts files, namely <tt/spcfont.15/, <tt/spcfsupp.15/, and<tt/stdfont.15/ , are need to put together in the same place, too.
<item>If you want to see GB codes or Japanese or Korean, get fonts <tt/cclib.16.gz cclib.16a.gz/, <tt/jis.16.gz/, <tt/ksc.16.gz/ from the site below and decompress them into <tt>/usr/local/lib/yact</tt>.

<sect1>chdrv
<p>
chdrv is a Chinese emulator program displaying and entering Chinese through console. Because chdrv access the tty device directly, it must be activated by the root. Now, chdrv is maintained by <htmlurl url="http://formosa.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~wycc/" name="Yu-Chung Wang"> &lt;<htmlurl url="mailto:wycc@iis.sinica.edu.tw" name="wycc@iis.sinica.edu.tw">&gt; and the newest one is chdrv-1.0.10.

<sect2>Getting chdrv
<p>
You can get it from 
<quote>
<htmlurl url="ftp://linux.cis.nctu.edu.tw/packages/chinese/chdrv/" name="ftp://linux.cis.nctu.edu.tw/packages/chinese/chdrv/">
</quote>
Get the source package, chdrv-1.0.10.tar.gz, binary package, chdrvbin-1.0.10.tar.gz, and fonts package, chdrvfont.tar.gz, respectively.

<sect2>Installation of chdrv
<p>
Unzip and untar the compressed binary file,
<tscreen><verb>
# tar xvzf chdrvbin-1.0.10.tar.gz
# mv chdrvfont.tar.gz chdrv-1.0.10/
# cd chdrv-1.0.10
</verb></tscreen>
Read the illustrations for installation in file <tt>INSTALL.1.0</tt> to modify file <tt>install</tt>. If you want your shadow password to works, you need to change the settings in <tt>chinese.conf</tt>. Erase the following comments off,
<verb>
LOGINPROGRAM /bin/telnet
</verb>
Freeze this line into remarks,
<verb>
LOGINPROGRAM /bin/login
</verb>
Now, you can execute the installation script.
<tscreen><verb>
# ./installbin
</verb></tscreen>


<sect1>cxterm
<p>
cxterm is a Chinese virtual terminal running under X Window System, and is the oldest Chinese displaying and inputing virtual terminal, which is provided various codes for Chinese, including BIG5 codes, GB codes, HZ codes and so on.
Because each cxterm opened needs to load Chinese data into the main memory, system resources are exhausted quite largely for it.

<sect2>Getting cxterm
<p>
The newest one is version of 5.0.p3 named <tt>cxterm5.0.p3.tar.gz</tt>, which contains both of cxterm codes and Chinese fonts. You can get it from here below,
<quote>
<htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.ifcss.org/pub/software/x-win/cxterm/" name="ftp://ftp.ifcss.org/pub/software/x-win/cxterm/">
</quote>
Or the rpm at <tt/ftp.redhat.com/: <tt/cxterm-color-5.0p3-1.i386.rpm/, <tt/cxterm-color-big5-5.0p3-1.i386.rpm/, <tt/cxterm-color-gb-5.0p3-1.i386.rpm/.
<quote>
<htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/contrib/hurricane/i386/" name="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/contrib/hurricane/i386/">
</quote>

<sect2>Installation of cxterm
<p>
Decompress the packed,
<tscreen><verb>
# tar -xvzf cxterm5.0.p3.tar.gz
</verb></tscreen>
The upper instruction will produce a new directory <tt>cxterm-5.0</tt>, and then invoke instructions as follows:
<tscreen><verb>
# cd cxterm-5.0
# ./config.sh
</verb></tscreen>
You need login as root to execute ``<tt>./config.sh</tt>'' if you wish all users on your computer can use cxterm well, then you can finish the steps of setup following the descriptions below:
<verb>
  0. Read COPYRIGHT Notice
  1. Compile, Install, and Configure "CXTERM 5.0" in One Step

  2. Compile cxterm (not to install)
  3. Install cxterm (after successful compilation in 2)
  4. Install additional Chinese font(s) for your X window
  5. Configure your account for using cxterm (after installation in 3)

  x. Exit
Please choose (0/1/2/3/4/5/x) :
</verb>

If you wish all things going through automatically, please choose <tt>1</tt>, and then enter the name of directory where to store the cxterm. If asking me, I will suggest this place,
<tt>/usr/local/chinese</tt>¡D
There are two kinds of Chinese fonts coming with the packed package, choosing <tt/1/ and <tt/3/ will make the procedure of installation all automatic.
In addition, you can select <tt/4/ to install some extra fonts, too. After achieving this setup, you need to put <tt>cxterm</tt> and <tt>CXterm</tt> into the path of searching directory.
<tscreen><verb>
# export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/chinese/bin
</verb></tscreen>

<tt>CXterm</tt> is just a shell script to load the resources of X and cxterm in. 
For using GB codes, invoke this following command,
<tscreen><verb>
# CXterm -gb
</verb></tscreen>
For BIG5 codes, invoke this following command,
<tscreen><verb>
# CXterm -big5
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>Color patch of CXterm
<p>
On the website<tt><htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.ifcss.org/pub/software/x-win/cxterm" name="ftp://ftp.ifcss.org/pub/software/x-win/cxterm"></tt>, there is a color patch for cxterm as well. Using this patch can make cxterm showing colors of ANSI.
Assuming that you put the original files of cxterm under the <tt>/tmp/cxterm-5.0</tt>, then
<tscreen><verb>
# cp cxterm-5.0.p3-color.patch.gz /tmp
# gzip -d cxterm-5.0.p3-color.patch.gz
# patch < cxterm-5.0.p3-color.patch
# cd cxterm-5.0
# ./config.sh
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>XA (Xcin Anywhere)<label id="xa">
<p>
XA is a small tool of an abbreviation for Xcin Anywhere, which can let you enter Chinese words with xcin under any common X-based softwares.
If making XA coordinating with CXWin(or XA+CV), you can get an environment of accessing Chinese for softwares not supported with Chinese. Thus, the xterm will become cxterm-like naturally. Cool, doesn't it?
XA is now extremely unstable as though, and you have to take charge of all risks if you want to explore it. As most things do, before working with XA, you must make xcin installed first. You can pick XA up into your pocket from here below:

Decompress the packed. Run <tt>./configure</tt> to produce <tt>mk</tt> and <tt>config.h</tt> on account for the compilation by using <tt>./mk</tt>.
If it works, key in <tt>./mk test xterm</tt> next to see if the xcin can be called out and enter Chinese under xterm to test.
If there is no problem, copy <tt/wrap.so/ to <tt>/usr/local/lib/</tt> following the syntax below:
<tscreen><verb>
# LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/wrap.so netscape &
</verb></tscreen>
Then, just follow the general method of using xcin.

<sect1>New Added Inputs
<p>
At present, there are two common formats of input table, namely <tt/tit/ and <tt/cin/, which both are plain text of formats. (That's means you can edit them directly from text editors.)
However, most Chinese Systems almost provide utilities for the purpose of exchanging pure text of formats into special binary of formats in order to speed up searching method.
Before you setup some certain input, you must own it's <tt/tit/ , <tt/cin/, or formats after transformation first .

I will take the Bo-Shia-My input as an example to show how to add it under each kind of Chinese system.
The input tables mentioned here can be found at<tt><htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.cis.nctu.edu.tw/UNIX/Chinese/Boshiamy/" name="ftp://ftp.cis.nctu.edu.tw/UNIX/Chinese/Boshiamy/"></tt>.

Other <tt/tit/ files are also available at <tt><htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.ifcss.org/pub/software/x-win/cxterm/dict/" name="ftp://ftp.ifcss.org/pub/software/x-win/cxterm/dict/"></tt>.

<sect2>xcin
<p>
Make use of utility <tt/cin2tab/ provided from xcin to transform the <tt/cin/ table into <tt/tab/ one.
<tscreen><verb>
# cin2tab boshiamy.cin
</verb></tscreen>
It will produce the two files: <tt/boshiamy.tab/ and <tt/boshiamy.tab.rev/. Put them into the directory of xcin and activate xcin next:
<tscreen><verb>
# xcin -in9 boshiamy.tab
</verb></tscreen>
To use Bo-Shia-My input, press the combination keys <tt/CTRL-ALT-9/.

<sect2>yact &amp; bcs16
<p>
yact takes the use of cit of version 2, and the same as cxterm. You can use the tool <tt/tit2cit/ accompanied with yact to make transformation available between <tt/boshiamy.tit/ and <tt/cit/.

Move <tt/boshiamy.cit/ into <tt>/usr/local/lib/yact</tt> and establish a symbol link for it:
<tscreen><verb>
# ln -s boshiamy.cit 9
</verb></tscreen> 
Like xcin does, Hit <tt/CTRL-ALT-9/ for calling Bo-Shia-My input.

<sect2>chdrv
<p>
At first, put <tt/boshiamy.tbl/ into <tt>/usr/local/lib/chinese</tt>. 
Secondly, modify <tt>/etc/chinese.conf</tt>, adding the follow section <tt/INPUT/ into it.
<code>
BEGIN INPUT
PHONETIC /usr/local/lib/chinese/phone.def
MULTI /usr/local/lib/chinese/boshiamy.tbl
END INPUT
</code>
Finally, use utility <tt/chconfig/ of chdrv to make the contents of <tt>/etc/chinese.conf</tt> effective.

<sect2>cxterm
<p>
Change <tt/boshiamy.tit/ into <tt/cit/ or <tt/citnf/ with the utility <tt/tit2cit/ of cxterm, then modify <tt/.Xdefaults/ to set a combination key for acting Bo-Shia-My input. Please refer to the technical document coming with cxterm for more information about installation and implementation in detail.

<sect1>Problems coming with input<label id="input">
<p>
After you accomplished the establishments of Chinese System, you have already been able to display Chinese on your Linux through monitors.
However, as using a Chinese editor, you will find that the Linux system can only display Chinese but cannot accept the input of Chinese.
You have to modify two spots, by yourself, to make Linux system becoming acceptable with output and input of Chinese if you want to improve these problems
At beginning, you need to add the locale setting to the shell profile file (Referring to the locale mini-HOWTO when concerning with locale).
Additionally, adding sets about inputs for the <tt/.inputrc/ file under your home directory is necessary too. (Please create it yourself if <tt/.inputrc/ didn't ever exist.)
Here are the configurations concerning with shell profile file and <tt/.inputrc/ file which are distributing on public domain(just as a reference, though):

Bash Shell:
Appending the following contents into <tt>/etc/profile</tt>, please.
<code>
stty cs8 -istrip
stty pass8
export LANG=C
export LC_CTYPE=iso-8859-1
</code>

Tcsh Shell:
Appending the following contents into <tt>/etc/csh.login</tt> or in <tt>/etc/csh.cshrc</tt>, please.
<code>
stty cs8 -istrip
stty pass8
setenv LANG C
setenv LC_CTYPE iso-8859-1
</code>

<tt>&dollar;HOME/.inputrc</tt> file for setup lists as follows:
<code>
set convert-meta off
set output-meta on
</code>

Eventually, prepare a text file contained with Chinese words by yourself, and use tool <tt/grep/ to search it. If it can find something exact, this means that your Linux system can work with Chinese words already.

<sect>Chinese X Window System
<p>
X Window System is a software with powerful environment of graphical user interface under UNIX System. XFree86 is a modified version from MIT X Window System and also freely distributed. 
<sect1>CXWin<label id="cxwin">
<p>
The Chinese X, abbreviated with CXWin, is really a patch of XFree86, making it can show Chinese words under X Window System.
Founder of it is <url url="mailto:srlee@csie.nctu.edu.tw" name="srlee">.
CXWin only support BIG5 code at present, and can let you be possessed of Chinese pop-up menus, of Chinese titles of windows, and of showing Chinese under a variety of window managers and applications. 

<sect2>How to get it?
<p>
You can get CXWin 3.3 from this ftp site below:
<quote>
<htmlurl url="ftp://linux.cis.nctu.edu.tw/packages/X/Xserver/CXwin/3.3/" name="ftp://linux.cis.nctu.edu.tw/packages/X/Xserver/CXwin/3.3/">
</quote>

If you use XFree86 3.2, you can get the Linux ELF format of version 3.2.
<quote>
<htmlurl url="ftp://linux.cis.nctu.edu.tw/packages/chinese/CXwin/binaries/" name="ftp://linux.cis.nctu.edu.tw/packages/chinese/CXwin/binaries/">
</quote>


All you need is to get the corresponding X server. For example, if your video card is matched with <tt/XF86_SVGA/, just take <tt/XF86_SVGA.gz/ home.
<tt>XF86_SVGA.gz</tt> should work properly on most video cards. 

If you system is compatible with rpm, you can get the newest CXWin 3.3.1 of rpm.
<quote>
<htmlurl url="ftp://linux.cis.nctu.edu.tw/packages/X/Xserver/CXwin/3.3.1/" name="ftp://linux.cis.nctu.edu.tw/packages/X/Xserver/CXwin/3.3.1/">
</quote>

<sect2>Patches
<p>
You can get the patches at the same place to compile to binary files by yourself if you've got the sources of XFree86.

<sect2>Installation
<p>
Make sure that you have these shared libraries if your choice is CXWin 3.3 (You can use <tt/ldconfig -p/ for an observation):
<tscreen><verb>
libm.so.5 => /lib/libm.so.5.0.6
libdl.so.1 => /lib/libdl.so.1.7.14
libc.so.5 => /lib/libc.so.5.3.12
</verb></tscreen>

If your choice is CXWin 3.2, then you need the libc of version 5.2.18 or newer.

First, unzip the compressed files of gzip. 
<tscreen><verb>
# gzip -d XF86_SVGA.gz
</verb></tscreen>
Duplicate the original X server as a copy as the root identification.
<tscreen><verb>
# cd /usr/X11R6/bin
# mv XF86_SVGA XF86_SVGA_BACKUP
</verb></tscreen>
Put the decompressed CXWin into the exact place and create the decent symbolic link:
<tscreen><verb>
# mv /tmp/XF86_SVGA /usr/X11R6/bin
# chown root.bin XF86_SVGA
# chmod 4755 XF86_SVGA
# ln -sf XF86_SVGA X
</verb></tscreen>

If your choice is rpm, then everything is more simple and more compact.
<tscreen><verb>
# rpm -Uvv XFree86-SVGA-3.3.1-1c.i386.rpm
</verb></tscreen>

CXWin needs the following <em>four BIG5 fonts</em> to work normally:
<tt/taipei15/, <tt/taipei16/, <tt/taipeik20/ and <tt/taipeik24/.
Install these Chinese fonts in accordance with the method of next section.

<sect1>Installation of Chinese fonts<label id="xfont">
<sect2>Where to get these fonts?
<p>
Maybe you have already installed some Chinese fonts; for GB fonts, you can find them out through the next way:
<tscreen><verb>
# xlsfonts | grep gb
-cclib-song-medium-r-normal--0-0-72-72-c-0-gb2312.1980-1
-cclib-song-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-c-160-gb2312.1980-1

The last five fonts are the previous five ones' aliases. To check the installed BIG5 fonts, using
<tscreen><verb>
# xlsfonts | grep big5
-kc-kai-medium-r-normal-fantizi-0-0-75-75-c-0-big5.eten.3.10-1

-uw-songti-medium-r-normal-fantizi-24-240-75-75-c-240-big5.eten.3.10-1
</verb></tscreen>
You can take all of it from this ftp site<tt><htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.ifcss.org/pub/software/fonts/" name="ftp://ftp.ifcss.org/pub/software/fonts/"></tt> if you haven't installed any of them or if you want more of them. The <tt>gb/bdf/</tt> amongst them is a GB font while the <tt>big5/bdf</tt> is a BIG5 font.
<sect2>Installation of X fonts
<p>
Assuming that you have already got a BIG5 font, <tt>eb5-24k2.bdf.gz</tt>, and a GB font, <tt>gb24st.bdf.gz</tt>. What you have to do first is that changing them into the format of <tt>.pcf</tt>.
<tscreen><verb>
# gzip -cd eb5-24k2.bdf.gz | bdftopcf -t > eb5-24k2.pcf
# gzip -cd gb24st.bdf.gz | bdftopcf -t > gb24st.pcf
# compress *.pcf
</verb></tscreen>
Then install them under <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc</tt>
<tscreen><verb>
# mv *.pcf.Z /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/
# cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc
# mkfontdir .
</verb></tscreen>
Now it should contain the following two lines in <tt>fonts.dir</tt>:
<tscreen><verb>
eb5-24k2.pcf.Z -kc-kai-medium-r-normal-fantizi-24-240-75-75-c-240-big5.eten.3.10-1
gb24st.pcf.Z -isas-song ti-medium-r-normal--24-240-72-72-c-240-gb2312.1980-0
</verb></tscreen>
You can create other aliases for these fonts for the advantages of saving typing time when using Chinese softwares.
Add the two lines in <tt>fonts.alias</tt>,
<tscreen><verb>
gb24st    "-isas-song ti-medium-r-normal--24-240-72-72-c-240-gb2312.1980-0"
taipeik24 "-kc-kai-medium-r-normal-fantizi-24-240-75-75-c-240-big5.eten.3.10-1"
</verb></tscreen>
Next, tell X Server to reload these fonts,
<tscreen><verb>
# xset fp rehash
</verb></tscreen>
If everything is fine, you can use the new fonts now:
<tscreen><verb>
# cxterm -GB -fn 12x24 -fh gb24st &
</verb></tscreen>

You can put these fonts into another directory, too, for instance,
<tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/chinese</tt>.
If this works, you have to add this line <tt>/etc/XF86Config</tt> to the Section "Files",
<tscreen><verb>
    FontPath    "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/chinese/"
</verb></tscreen>

So, when you start X next time, you can use these fonts without any problems.

<sect2>Transformations from other fonts to X fonts
<p>
There is a TTF2BDF program, written by lwj, can let you transform the TTF fonts of Windows into BDF fonts. You can get it from here below:
<quote>
<htmlurl url="ftp://linux.cis.nctu.edu.tw/packages/chinese/TTF2BDF.EXE" name="ftp://linux.cis.nctu.edu.tw/packages/chinese/TTF2BDF.EXE">
</quote>
This is a Win32 program, thus you must execute it on Windows 95 or NT.

Next step is that change BDF into PCF, then you can use it under X. (You can use BDF directly under X; but that BDF carried with bigger sizes means PCF will be a better choice though.)
<tscreen><verb>
# bdftopcf -t < ming.bdf > ming.pcf
</verb></tscreen>

You may change HBF into BDF and PCF fonts, too. Here is the ftp site for the utility of transformation.

<sect1>TaBE &amp; B5LE
<p>
TaBE and B5LE(Big5 Locale Environment) are projects both based on locale for solving the Chinese ability under X.
If we can finish them, then the problems coming with Chinese I/O under X can be resolved thoroughly.

The TaBE author, shawn, has been taken for the military service in Taiwan, and the homepage of TaBE had been removed either(so awfully?), so this project has been dead from that time.

Author of B5LE is Thinker &lt;<htmlurl url="mailto:Thinker.bbs@bbs.yzu.edu.tw" name="Thinker.bbs@bbs.yzu.edu.tw">&gt;. However, the major platform is FreeBSD , though. If someone install B5LE successfully on Linux platform, please let me know about it. The concerned homepage is listed as follows:

<!----------          Next Section          ---------->
<sect>Printing for Chinese
<p>
This section will teach you how to print Chinese documents, but without the demonstrations of how to set up your printer; that you have to make it all ready by yourself.
Tools introduced in this section are all for transformations to PostScript format; hence, you need to set your printer up in order to print PostScript files. If your printer doesn't support PostScript directly, you can install <tt><htmlurl url="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html" name="ghostscript"></tt> instead.
Please refer to <htmlurl url="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Printing-HOWTO.html" name="Printing HOWTO">.

<sect1>cnprint
<p>
<tt/cnprint/ is a printing tool for the purpose of changing Chinese text files into PostScript format, of which commands are the same as the standard ones. It supports GB, HZ, and BIG5 codes simultaneously. 

<sect2>Where to get it?
<p>
Download it from <tt><htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.ifcss.org/pub/software/unix/print" name="ftp://ftp.ifcss.org/pub/software/unix/print"></tt>, of which name is <tt>cnprint280.tar.gz</tt>.

<sect2>Setting up cnprint
<p>
<tt>cnprint280.tar.gz</tt> contains only five files.
<tscreen><verb>
# ls
cnprint.1          cnprint.cmd        cnprint280.README
cnprint.c          cnprint.help
</verb></tscreen>
Compile it through this way below: 
<tscreen><verb>
# gcc cnprint.c -o cnprint
# mv cnprint /usr/local/bin
# mv cnprint.1 /usr/local/man/man1
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>Installing HBF fonts<label id="hbf">
<p>
HBF fonts includes both description files and fonts files. A <tt/.hbf/ is the header file describing fonts, with a texture of plain text, recording the file names of its fonts files.
Both of two files must be installed yourself. You can find them at <tt><htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.ifcss.org/pub/software/fonts/" name="ftp://ftp.ifcss.org/pub/software/fonts/"></tt>.

If you want to use <tt>ccfs24.hbf</tt>, for example, which is a sort of simplified Sung-imitated style font, you must obtain these three following files: <tt>ccfs24.hbf</tt>, <tt>cclib.n24</tt> and <tt>ccsym.24</tt>.
In the ifcss fonts directory, <tt>00index.txt</tt> lists all HBF fonts' filenames.
Establish a specific directory to store HBF fonts, just like <tt>/usr/local/lib/chinese/HBF/</tt>, for instance. Put all HBF description files and fonts files you've got together under this directory, then export the complete directory pathname for HBF out of environmental variables.
<tscreen><verb>
# export HBFPATH="/usr/local/lib/chinese/HBF/"
</verb></tscreen>

This file <tt>cnprint.cmd</tt> contains some default values for <tt>cnprint</tt>, that you have to fix them up to point to the HBF fonts you have installed, and then export it to <tt>&dollar;HBFPATH</tt>.
<tscreen><verb>
# cp cnprint.cmd $HBFPATH
</verb></tscreen>
Now, you can use ``<tt>cnprint -w FILENAME</tt>'' to change Chinese text files into PostScript files well. For more information in detail, take a look at <tt/man cnprint/ yourself.

<sect2>Code Transformation
<p>
The <tt/cnprint 2.80/ has been added a great deal of <em/splendid abilities/ such as transformations amongst various code formats, for example, BIG5 <=> GB <=> HZ.
For BIG5 <=> GB, you need another tabulation for installing, though, which can be found from this following site:
<quote>
<htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.ifcss.org/pub/software/unix/convert/hc.tab" name="ftp://ftp.ifcss.org/pub/software/unix/convert/hc.tab">
</quote>
Put it under the fonts directory of HBF, and modify <tt/cnprint.cmd/, adding this   
<tscreen><verb>
DEFAULT_GBB5_TABLEFILE: /usr/local/lib/chinese/HBF/hc.tab
</verb></tscreen>

Not only, for BIG5 into GB codes, can the transformation of <tt/cnprint 2.80/ against <bf/words to words/ be done, but also the work against <bf/phases to phases/. However, <tt/cnprint/ itself didn't offer the dictionary for transformations, that means that you have to create a dictionary yourself if you need one. Please refer to <tt/man cnprint/ for more details.

<sect1>ps2cps
<p>
The purpose of this small program is to make PostScript files, which could not pork Chinese out to output devices, available for Chinese output.
For example, when Netscape is printing files, it will transport files into PostScript formats first; however, the outputs of PostScript won't load Chinese fonts so that the original parts of Chinese words will become disturbed codes to output.
This program can read PostScript in, and replace the disturbed codes with corresponding words; afterwards pork the results out to the standard output devices, which the output data can send to the printer that can print PostScript documents.

Pick ps2cps up from this site:
<quote>
<htmlurl url="ftp://linux.cis.nctu.edu.tw/packages/chinese/misc/ps2cps-0.1.tgz" name="ftp://linux.cis.nctu.edu.tw/packages/chinese/misc/ps2cps-0.1.tgz">
</quote>

Untar and unzip this file, and modify Makefile according to your demands:
<tscreen><verb>
    BINPATH    : Installing pathname for binary ps2cps 
    PS2CPSPATH : Resources files' pathname for PS2CPS 
    PS2CPSRC   : Filename of resources files for PS2CPS 
</verb></tscreen>

Next step is <tt/make all install/.

You have to install HBF Chinese fonts first according to the previous section, and then modify your <tt/ps2cpsrc/ file:
<tscreen><verb>
    HBF_PATH:      Define the directory pathname of HBF fonts
    HBF_NAME:      Define filenames of HBF fonts(NOT including pathname)
    CH_WORD_SHIFT: Define shift of Chinese fonts
</verb></tscreen>
The last item is used for adjustment of Chinese fonts' locations. Some Chinese fonts and the original English fonts may probably not locate on the same horizontal level line, so you can set this variable, of which numeric values ranging from -1.0 to +1.0, activated to adjust it up or down. 

So, you can use that examples made from the founder to do some tests:
<tscreen><verb>
# ps2cps thhsieh.ps > c-thhsieh.ps
</verb></tscreen>
Use <tt/ghostview/ to see whether you can see Chinese words or not. 

However, this program is still under beta, there are so many problems waitting for resolving. If you have any questions or recommendations, you can send messages to the author directly: Tung-Han Hsieh &lt;<htmlurl url="mailto:thhsieh@twclx.phys.ntu.edu.tw" name="thhsieh@twclx.phys.ntu.edu.tw">&gt;.

<sect1>bg2ps
<p>
This is another program which can transform BIG5-based Chinese files into PostScript available for printing(the same as cnprint).
But because it uses the TrueType fonts, the output is more beautiful than others. In addition, it has a script which can transform PostScript out of Netscape into Chinese.
The author is <htmlurl url="http://weber.u.washington.edu/~cschin/chinhome.html" name="Chen-Shan Chin"> &lt;<htmlurl url="mailto:cschin@u.washington.edu" name="cschin@u.washington.edu">&gt;.

<sect2>Installing bg2ps
<p>
Decompress and compile it:
<tscreen><verb>
# mkdir bg2ps
# cd bg2ps
# tar xzvf bg5ps.tgz 
# gcc -O2 ttf2psm.c -o ttf2psm
</verb></tscreen>

Install TrueType fonts next. You can install it under the same directory of bg2ps or can assign another directory for use. Refer to <ref id="ntuttf" name="Installing TTF fonts"> for more explanations.
Then create a <tt/.bg5ps.conf/ under the directory, and you can pick directly up the sample file coming with this program to modify.
The most important is to assign the directory where you installed the TrueType fonts to <tt/chineseFontPath/, and rename the content of <tt/fontName/ to the fonts name you used.

Test the sample coming with it, and view the output as <tt/ghostview/ or <tt/gv/.
<tscreen><verb>
# ./bg5ps -if test.big5 -of test.ps
# ghostview test.ps
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>Installing nps2cps
<p>
The nps2cps has no extra configuration files. You need to modify yourself  <tt/chineseFontPath/ and <tt/fontName/ in <tt/nps2cps/ script. 

Test nps2cps:
<tscreen><verb>
# nps2cps < netscape.ps > test.ps

<sect>Chinese Printing Softwares
<sect1>LaTeX + CJK
<p>
TeX/LaTeX is a set of printing softwares, of which excellent and elegant output quality have been admiring and adopting out of the academic circles for several years. The CJK is a LaTeX2e macro package, which can let you use CJK (Chinese/Japanese /Korean) literal codes in TeX documents.

You need install TeX/LaTeX first on your Linux system; many Linux distributions have been included teTeX/LaTeX already. If haven't, you could install it by yourself. Please link to
<htmlurl url="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/TeTeX-HOWTO.html" name="teTeX HOWTO"> for more information.

<sect2>Getting this software
<p>
Obtain CJK 4.1.3 from this site: 
<quote>

</quote>

Bring the demanded TTF fonts home: 
<quote>
<htmlurl url="ftp://nctuccca.edu.tw/Chinese/ifcss/software/fonts/big5/ms-win/" name="ftp://nctuccca.edu.tw/Chinese/ifcss/software/fonts/big5/ms-win/">
</quote>

<sect2>Installation
<p>
You must have an clear ideal about the teTeX/LaTeX installing directory, <tt/&dollar;TEXMF/, for example, <tt>/usr/lib/texmf</tt>.
And I assume that you will use the <tt/ntu_kai.ttf/ font; if doesn't, make a change to match it.

<itemize>
<item>Put the downloaded fonts, after <ref id="ntuttf" name="decompression">, into the <tt>&dollar;TEXMF/fonts/truetype/chinese</tt>.
<item>Unzip and untar CJK-4.1.3.src.tar.gz, and mv the sub-directory <tt/texinput/ to <tt>&dollar;TEXMF/tex/latex</tt>, and rename it to <tt/CJK/, and create the fonts directory. 
<tscreen><verb>
# cd 4_1.3/; mv ./texinput $TEXMF/tex/latex/CJK
# mkdir -p $TEXMF/fonts/tfm/chinese/ntukai
# mkdir $TEXMF/ttf2pk
# mkdir $TEXMF/hbf2gf
</verb></tscreen>

<item>To come immediately, it will probably be the most difficult step. You need to invoke <tt/patch/ command to append <tt/*.diff/ under <tt>4_1.3/doc/teTeX</tt> upon these following files: 
<tscreen><verb>
  /usr/bin/MakeTeX*
  $TEXMF/web2c/texmf.cnf
  $TEXMF/fontname/special.map   
</verb></tscreen>
For instance:
<tscreen><verb>
# cd /usr/bin
# patch -s < 4_1.3/doc/teTeX/MakeTeXPK.diff
</verb></tscreen>
According to the enormous TeX versions, your action with <tt/patch/ may fail perhaps. If so, you need to do it manually by yourself to patch these parts of failure( the portions of failure will record in <tt/.rej/). If you don't understand the theory of <tt/patch/ well, you had better get someone experienced to help you.

<item>Compiling and installing <tt/bg5conv/
<tscreen><verb>
# cd 4_1.3/utils/Bg5conv; gcc -o bg5conv bg5conv.c
# chmod 755 bg5latex
# cp bg5conv bg5latex /usr/local/bin/
# gzip bg5conv.1; cp bg5conv.1.gz /usr/local/man/man1/   
</verb></tscreen>
Because there are some codes in BIG5 TeX documents may contain <tt/&lcub;/, <tt/&rcub;/, <tt/&amp;/ and so forth, which are the specific tokens to TeX , the <tt/bg5conv/ can change this codes into certain format that can let TeX manipulate.

<item>Compile and install <tt/ttf2pk/, which can change TrueType fonts into TeX's pk fonts. 
<tscreen><verb>
# cd 4_1.3/utils/ttf2pk/src
# make all OS=unix
# cp ttf2pk /usr/local/bin/
# cd ..
# cp config/ttf2pk.cfg  $TEXMF/ttf2pk/
# gzip ttf2pk.1; cp ttf2pk.1.gz /usr/local/man/man1/
# cp c00kai.fd $TEXMF/tex/latex/CJK/Bg5/
# cp MakeTTFPK /usr/local/bin
</verb></tscreen>

<item>If you want to print documents vertically, you have to edit a <tt/c00kair.fd/ file under <tt>&dollar;TEXMF/tex/latex/CJK/Bg5/</tt>:

<code>
\def\fileversion{4.1.0}
\def\filedate{1996/11/20}
\ProvidesFile{c00kair.fd}[\filedate\space\fileversion]

% traditional Chinese characters in Big 5 encoding scheme.

% font shape: kai
% ntu_kai.ttf is Kai3 Shu1 (&amp;quotmodel book")

\DeclareFontFamily{C00}{kair}{}

\DeclareFontShape{C00}{kair}{m}{n}{<-> CJK * ntukar}{}
\DeclareFontShape{C00}{kair}{bx}{n}{<-> CJKb * ntukar}{\CJKbold}

\endinput
</code>
 
<item>Execute <tt/texconfig/:
<tscreen><verb>
# texconfig rehash
# texconfig hyphen
</verb></tscreen>
</itemize>

<sect2>Tests
<p>
<itemize>
<item>Horizontal printing tests:
<tscreen><verb>
# cd 4_1.3/examples
# bg5latex Big5.tex          (See if there is a Big5.dvi appeared ?)
# xdvi Big5.dvi              (Can you see Chinese? Of course, in X mode)
# dvips Big5.dvi -o Big5.ps  (Change to PostScript format)
# ghostview Big5.ps          (View it as ghostview)
# lpr Big5.ps                (Send it to printers, see if there are Chinese printed.)
</verb></tscreen>

<item>Vertical printing tests: You can use the <tt/Big5vert.tex/ file under <tt/examples/ to repeat those previous procedures. 
</itemize>

<sect2>Adding New Fonts
<p>
For example, if you want to change to the Ming style font <tt/ntu_mm.ttf/, then
<p>
<itemize>
<item>put your TrueType fonts under <tt>&dollar;TEXMF/fonts/truetype/chinese</tt>.
<item>And then add the two lines in <tt>&dollar;TEXMF/ttf2pk/ttf2pk.cfg</tt>:
<tscreen><verb>
ntumm:  -e Big5 &dollar;TEXMF/fonts/truetype/chinese/ntu_mm.ttf
ntummr: -r 1 -e Big5 &dollar;TEXMF/fonts/truetype/chinese/ntu_mm.ttf
</verb></tscreen> 
<item>Create the <tt/c00ming.fd/ file: 
<tscreen><verb>
# cd 4_1.3/utils/ttf2pk
# cp c00ming.fd &dollar;TEXMF/tex/latex/CJK/Bg5/
</verb></tscreen>
<item>Execute the <tt/texconfig/ again. 
<item>Change kai to ming in file <tt>4_1.3/examples/Big5.tex</tt>, and then repeat this steps, <tt/bg5latex/, <tt/xdvi/, <tt/dvips/ and so on, to see if the results correct or not. 
<item>If you want to print files vertically, redo this section's installation and create the <tt/c00mingr.fd/ file listed as follows, and then change kair to mingr in <tt/Big5vert.tex/ file, and repeat tests processes. 
<code>
\def\fileversion{4.1.0}
\def\filedate{1996/11/20}
\ProvidesFile{c00kair.fd}[\filedate\space\fileversion]

\DeclareFontFamily{C00}{mingr}{}

\DeclareFontShape{C00}{mingr}{m}{n}{<-> CJK * ntummr}{}
\DeclareFontShape{C00}{mingr}{bx}{n}{<-> CJKb * ntummr}{\CJKbold}

\endinput 
</code>

</itemize>

<sect2>Creating CJK Documents
<p>
The dominant difference between Chinese CJK TeX documents and general LaTeX ones is that:
<itemize>
<item>There should exist the &bsol;usepackage{CJK} command in the preamble (&bsol;documentclass to &bsol;begin{document}¡^section, that means you must have CJK.sty loaded. 
<item> Chinese words must be under the circumstances of CJK or CJK*.
<item>If you want to change fonts, you can use &bsol;CJKfamily command, for example, the command &bsol;CJKfamily{fs} will change the following fonts as Song-imitated fonts( Certainly, the <tt/fs/ fonts' name must be defined in <tt/c00fs.fd/). 
</itemize>
This is a demonstration for CJK document:
<code>
  \documentclass[12pt]{article}
  \usepackage{CJK}
  \begin{document}
    \begin{CJK*}{Bg5}{kai}

      \section{first section}
      \section{second section}
      Paragraphs, sections, pictures, tables, references and so forth... 
      ...

    \end{CJK*}
  \end{document} 
</code>

<sect1>ChiTeX
<p>
Developed by professor Chen Hung-Yih &lt<htmlurl url="mailto:yih@math.ncu.edu.tw" name="yih@math.ncu.edu.tw">&gt;.
Operations with the ChiTeX are easy enough just like the English TeX, apart from some special instructions.

<sect2>Obatining it
<p>
From here, you can find its vestige:
<quote>
<htmlurl url="ftp://dongpo.math.ncu.edu.tw/tex-archive/local/chitex/chitex/Linux/" name="ftp://dongpo.math.ncu.edu.tw/tex-archive/local/chitex/chitex/Linux/">
</quote>

<sect2>Installing
<p>
You should know what's the version of TeX installed on your Linux.. On older system, the installed one usually is NTeX while on newer one, it will be always teTeX .
How to tell which TeX you've installed, teTeX or NTeX, on your Linux System. Just run the TeX. If the monitor appears
<tscreen><verb>
This is TeX, Version 3.14159 
</verb></tscreen>
, then it is teTeX. Otherwise,
<tscreen><verb>
This is TeX, Version 3.1415N
</verb></tscreen>
It is NTeX.
Download the exact ChiTeX corresponding to your version of TeX.

It is simple to install ChiTeX. Just put <tt/chitex60.tgz/(teTeX) or <tt/chitexN.tgz/(NTeX) and <tt/fonts1.tgz/, <tt/fonts2.tgz/ under <tt>/usr/local</tt>.
And decompress <tt/chitex60.tgz/ to execute setup program <tt/csetup/.
<tscreen><verb>
# tar zxvf chitex60.tgz
# cd chitex60
# ./csetup
</verb></tscreen>

If you are using Red Hat 5.0, you may install the rpm package I made:
<quote>
<htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.phys.ntu.edu.tw/pub/os/linux/rpm/" name="ftp://ftp.phys.ntu.edu.tw/pub/os/linux/rpm/chitex-6.0.7-1.i386.rpm">
</quote>

<sect2>Installing fonts
<p>
You can install Chinese TrueType fonts for ChiTeX.
<itemize>
<item>Put TrueType fonts under <tt>&dollar;TEXMF/fonts/chinese/ttf</tt>.
<item>Modify <tt>&dollar;TEXMF/tex/chinese/chitex.fdf</tt>, and add a new line:
<tscreen><verb>
\choosechfont{fontname}{filename}
</verb></tscreen>
In it, the <tt/filename/ is the fonts' names erased the <tt/.ttf/ part, and <tt/&bsol;fontname/ is the macro that you can use for this font in your document.
For example, if you want to use a font named <tt/avntmv.ttf/, put a line <tt>&bsol;choosechfont{ming}{avntmv}</tt>, and use the macro <tt/&bsol;ming/ to use the font <tt/avntmv.ttf/.
<item>In <tt/chitex.fdf/, there were several fonts defined; thus, if you want to install these fonts, you don't have to change <tt/chitex.fdf/ any more. 
<tscreen><verb>
 \kai    ---->  ntukai.ttf
 \li     ---->  ntuli.ttf
 \mr     ---->  ntumr.ttf
 \fs     ---->  ntufs.ttf
</verb></tscreen>
</itemize>

<sect2>Tests
<p>
Now, you can take the samples enclosed with ChiTeX to test:
<tscreen><verb>
# chilatex math2.tex        (Compiling)
# xdvi math2                (pre-viewing)
# dvips math2               (Changing to PostScript file)
# ghostview math2.ps        (Using ghostview to view the output)
</verb></tscreen>

You can also write a small document to test the new installed fonts:
<code>
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\begin{document}
\ming
   This is a test(You should type these words in Chinese). 
\end{document}
</code>

<sect1>Dtop
<p>
The Dtop is a Chinese printing software for the UNIX platform, developed by the <url url="http://www.bdc.com.tw/" name="Behavior Design Corporation">. 
In early November, 1995, it released the version of v1.4, which was composite of five various platforms, simultaneously. The Linux beta version provided the users with a trial of free and endless expiration, which has created another nice Chinese environment for Linux fans. However, the formal version is late for publishing until now due to the tiny scope of business market. It seems that this had been ceased to develop.

<sect2>How to Get it? 
<p>
The beta version of Dtop for Linux can download from each school's ftp site:
<itemize>
<item><url url="ftp://nctuccca.edu.tw/Chinese/ifcss/software/linux/X11R6/dtop1.4/pub/">
<item><url url="ftp://ftp.ntu.edu.tw/Chinese/ifcss/software/linux/X11R6/dtop1.4/pub/">
<item><url url="ftp://ftp.ccu.edu.tw/pub3/chinese/linux/X11R6/dtop1.4/pub/">
<item><url url="ftp://ftp.ncu.edu.tw/OS/linux/X/ifcss/X11R6/dtop1.4/pub/">
<item><url url="ftp://ftp.ifcss.org/pub/software/linux/X11R6/dtop1.4/pub/">
</itemize>

There are three sub-directories saying respectively,
<descrip>
<tag/dtop.linux/
Storage for binary files and data files of Dtop, which can divide into three major files. After decompressing all files, the disk space demanded is about 40MB.
<tag/dtop.readme/
Storage for related documents of Dtop, which are stored as the file format defined by Dtop. Users can read this papers through this beta version directly. 
<tag/dtop.manual/
Storage of references for X version of Dtop, which are stored as the file format defined by Dtop. The X version can access through Linux, IBM AIX, HP-UX, Sun 4.1.x, and Solaris directly. 
</descrip>

<sect2>Installing
<p>
The hardware required is something like this: CPU 486 DX-33 or later, RAM 16MB or larger, 50MB disk space or so. If there is no enough memory on your system, you will get nuts someday. 

Decompress all the files under <tt/dtop.linux/ to a self-selected directory, for example, 
<tt>/usr/local/dtop</tt>.

Before implementing it, you must first set environment variable <tt/&dollar;DTOPHOME/, which is the directory that preparing to install Dtop. The <tt/&dollar;DTOPTMP/ is a temporary directory for Dtop, which is usually <tt>/tmp</tt>. The <tt/XAPPLRESDIR/ is the directory for resources files of Dtop, which is set at 
<tt>&dollar;DTOPHOME/user</tt> .
<tscreen><verb>
# export DTOPHOME=/usr/local/dtop
# export DTOPTMP=/tmp
# export XAPPLRESDIR=DTOPHOME/user
</verb></tscreen>

You need to set the Chinese fonts directory used by Dtop.
<tscreen><verb>
# xset fp+ $DTOPHOME/pcf.chn
</verb></tscreen>

Finally, you have to configure the Keysym matching table caused by the matching between Keysym and Keycode under X different from workstations. The Keysyms of <tt/BackSpace/ and <tt/Delete/, for example, are all matching to the same Keycode under X, regarding the behavior of <tt/BackSpace/ as the <tt/Delete/'s in reality . To solve this problem, the Dtop creates a Keysym file, locating under <tt>&dollar;DTOPHOME/user</tt> of which filename is <tt/dtop_keysym.linux/. After starting X, invoke the command, 
<tscreen><verb>
# xmodmap dtop_keysym.linux
</verb></tscreen>

Another solution is that invoke commands directly on shell:
<tscreen><verb>
# xmodmap -e "keycode 22 = BackSpace"
# xmodmap -e "keycode 107 = Delete"
</verb></tscreen>

When everything is ready, you can execute Dtop.
<tscreen><verb>
# $DTOPHOME/bin/dtop14
</verb></tscreen>

You may read all the on-line references enclosed in Dtop for more detailed introductions.

<sect1>ChinesePower
<p>
The ChinesePower is a Far-East Editor running under X, which is easy and classified as WYSIWYG. 
It supports BIG5, GB, Japanese and Korean mixed inputs, and the printing and displaying PostScript format. It can generate GIF graphics of seven colors for documents, which is adequate for Chinese homepages. ChinesePower uses HBF or TTF fonts.

You can get it from,
<quote>
<htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.ifcss.org/pub/software/x-win/editor/chpower-2.0.tar.gz" name="ftp://ftp.ifcss.org/pub/software/x-win/editor/chpower-2.0.tar.gz">
</quote>

To compile Chinese Power, you will need HBF fonts and Motif libraries. At first, modify <tt/Makefile/ to fit your system, then
<tscreen><verb>
# make
</verb></tscreen>
After making step, it will generate binary executable files. 
Then export environment variables:
<tscreen><verb>
# export HBFPATH=/usr/local/lib/chinese/HBF/
# export TTFPATH=/usr/local/lib/chinese/TTF/
# export HZINPUTDIR=/usr/local/lib/chinese/dict/

<sect2>Compiling and Installation
<p>
Decompress packed files and add the patch in.
<tscreen><verb>
# tar -xvzf mule-2.3.tar.gz
# patch < mule-2.3+lx.diff 
# cd mule-2.3/
# ./configure "i386-*-linux" --with-x11 --with-x-toolkit --with-gcc
</verb></tscreen>
If you want to rectify the out-looking of mule to fit your taste, read <tt/INSTALL/ file, please.
And run ``<tt>./configure --help</tt>''. 
Then, correct ``<tt>src/Makefile</tt>'', changing ``<tt>-lcurses</tt>'' to ``<tt>-lncurses</tt>''.
Then,
<tscreen><verb>
# make
# make install
</verb></tscreen>
Default installing directory is <tt>/usr/local</tt>.

<sect2>Using Chinese in Mule-2.3
<p>
If you have already installed fonts, you can use mule to enter and show Chinese. Most fonts are 16 or 24 points, so you can:
<tscreen><verb>
# mule -fn 8x16 &
</verb></tscreen>
or
<tscreen><verb>
# mule -fn 12x24 &
</verb></tscreen>
According to <tt>M-x load-library RETURN chinese RETURN</tt> .
``<tt/Ctrl-]/'' to shift inputs.

<sect>Related Chinese Problems with Others<label id="other">
<sect1>Netscape Navigator<label id="netscape">
<p>Netscape 2.0 or later support both BIG5 and GB codes, which have already discussed on several homepages. To display Chinese in Netscape, there are three steps:
<enum>
    <item>Install Chinese fonts of X. Refer to the section <ref id="xfont" name="Installing Chinese Fonts"> .
    <item>Run <tt>netscape</tt>, and configure <tt/Document Encoding/ as <tt/Traditional Chinese (Big5)/ or <tt/Simplified Chinese/.
	<itemize>
		<item>In Netscape 2.x or 3.x, this will configure at <tt>Options/Document Encoding/...</tt>.
		<item>In Netscape Communicator 4.x, configure it at <tt>View/Encoding/...</tt>.
	</itemize>
	<item>Select the Chinese fonts you want. 
	<itemize>
		<item>In Netscape 2.x, 3.x, configure it at <tt>Options/General Preferences/Fonts</tt>.
		<item>In Netscape Communicator 4.x, configure it at <tt>Edit/Preferences.../Appearance/Fonts</tt>.
	</itemize>
</enum>
Maybe you will feel so strange that why you can only use <tt>Fixed(HKU) Size 16.0</tt>, which is causing from the settings in <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/Netscape</tt>.
Assuming that you have the following BIG5 fonts: 
<tscreen><verb>
# xlsfonts | grep big5
-hku-fixed-medium-r-normal--0-0-72-72-c-0-big5.hku-0
-hku-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-c-160-big5.hku-0
-kc-kai-medium-r-normal-fantizi-0-0-75-75-c-0-big5.eten.3.10-1
-kc-kai-medium-r-normal-fantizi-20-200-75-75-c-200-big5.eten.3.10-1
-kc-kai-medium-r-normal-fantizi-24-240-75-75-c-240-big5.eten.3.10-1
-kc-ming-medium-r-normal-fantizi-0-0-75-75-c-0-big5.eten.3.10-1
-kc-ming-medium-r-normal-fantizi-15-150-75-75-c-160-big5.eten.3.10-1
-kc-ming-medium-r-normal-fantizi-24-240-75-75-c-240-big5.eten.3.10-1
</verb></tscreen>
Add one line to <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/Netscape</tt>
<tscreen><verb>
*documentFonts.charset*big5.eten.3.10-1:              x-x-big5
</verb></tscreen>
Then, Netscape can use these fonts well.

Another solution is to name aliases for your fonts's names: Adding aliases in the <tt/fonts.alias/ file(create it yourself if there is no such a file) under your fonts directory.
<tscreen><verb>
-big5-taipeik-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-c-160-big5.hku-1 taipei16
-big5-taipeik-medium-r-normal--20-200-72-72-c-200-big5.hku-1 taipeik20
-big5-taipeik-medium-r-normal--24-240-72-72-c-240-big5.hku-1 taipeik24
</verb></tscreen>

The fonts filenames, like <tt/taipeik20/, are that you need to give aliases to them. After modification, do 
<tscreen><verb>
# xset fp rehash
</verb></tscreen>
to reload fonts's names to make them available.

You may find that the sizes of Chinese and English are out of proportion in homepages of Chinese-English languages(such as too small English words), which is the reason that what you've selected for English fonts and Chinese fonts is unbalanced at the magnitude. Go back to the configuration for fonts, and select Western(iso-8859-1). Then, in your opinion, change the size of English fonts to make it perfect in proportions.

<sect1>sendmail<label id="sendmail">
<p>
Because defaults of <tt/sendmail 8.8.x/ will encode all 8-bit mails first before sending them out, which may or may not reduce influences to those receiver. (Refer to<ref id="procmail" name="Next Sub-Section"> for solutions).
Most hosts can directly send 8-bit mails now, so you had better re-compile <tt/sendmail/ and close the encoding ability.

<sect1>procmail<label id="procmail">
<p>
<tt/procmail/ is an electronic mail filter, which can manipulate mails first before storing them into your mailbox, for example, classification for mails and so on. 
Though, I want to teach you how to make use of <tt/procmail/ to uncode the encoded ones into pure text files and how to convert the various encoded mails into common encoding you used here.

Create <tt/.procmailrc/ file under your home directory, listed as follows: 
<code>
# To avoid accidents, store mails before using procmail. 
# You can filter mails to ensure which mail doesn't need to duplicate
# by, for example, MAILER-DAEMON. 
:0 c
* !^From.*MAILER-DAEMON
mail/procmail-backup

# Uncode mails encoded by quoted-printable or base64. 
:0
* ^Content-Type: *text/plain
{
    :0 fbw
    * ^Content-Transfer-Encoding: *quoted-printable
    | mimencode -u -q

        :0 Afhw
        | formail -I "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit" \
                  -I "X-Mimed-Autoconverted: quoted-printable to 8bit by procmail"

    :0 fbw
    * ^Content-Transfer-Encoding: *base64
    | mimencode -u -b

        :0 Afhw
        | formail -I "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit" \
                  -I "X-Mimed-Autoconverted: base64 to 8bit by procmail"
}

# Here will judge whether a mail is GB codes or not; if it is, convert it
# into BIG5 codes. If you want to convert BIG5 codes into GB codes, you
# need to exchange big5 with gb2312 and replace 'hc -m b2g' with 'hc -m g2b'. 

:0
* ^Content-Type:.*text/plain;.*charset=gb2312
{
    :0 fw
    | hc -m b2g -t /usr/local/lib/chinese/hc.tab

        :0 Afhw
        | formail -I "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=big5" \
                  -I "X-Charset-Autoconverted: gb2312 to big5 by procmail"
}

# Store mails into mailbox. 
:0:
${ORGMAIL}
</code>

In this case, integrating with <tt/mimencode/, <tt/formail/ to decode mails, and use <tt><ref id="hc" name="hc"></tt> to convert GB codes mails into BIG5 codes mails. Thus, you have to install these tools in order to use procmail.

Eventually, rectify your <tt/.forward/ file. 
<tscreen><verb>
"|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/bin/procmail -f- ~/.procmailrc ||exit 75 #login"
</verb></tscreen>
<bf/Notes/: change the <tt/login/ as your login name.

<sect1>telnet<label id="telnet">
<p>
If you can access Chinese on your own machine, but cannot access Chinese while telnet to other machines, then the problems may cause from <tt/telnet/ itself.
When telnet is being under connection, you can press <tt/Ctrl-]/ to jump out temporarily, and enter <bf/set binary/ at the prompt of <tt>telnet></tt> to assure the fully transmission of bits.
You can also use <tt/telnet -8/ to make connections (but it seems won't work for some sites...?).
Another more simple method is to use directly a 8-bit <tt/telnet/ program. Download the binary file from here:

<sect1>less
<p>
<tt/less/ itself can display Chinese directly; just set the following environment variable can Chinese display: 
<tscreen><verb>
# export LESSCHARSET=latin1
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>pine
<p>
Pine of version 3.95 later can support reading and entering Chinese mails. As you execute pine, select <tt>SETUP/Config</tt> in <tt/feature list/, choose this(hit <tt/X/):
<tscreen><verb>
   [X]  enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation
   [X]  enable-8bit-nntp-posting
</verb></tscreen>

Then, hit <tt/C/ on <tt/character-set/, and change its value to big5 or gb2312.
Finally, hit <tt/E/ to escape and store this change.

You can also install the cpine capable of showing Chinese messages:

Use the switch <tt/-l/ to start <tt/minicom/, then you can see Chinese in minicom. 

<sect1>fingerd
<p>
If you type Chinese in your <tt/.plan/ but can't be saw by others, this is probably caused by the inability of <tt/fingerd/ to send out 8-bit Chinese words.

<sect>FAQs
<sect1>Why Can't I Enter Chinese?
<p><bf/Answer/:
This question is quite ambiguous, though. I cannot tell which condition that you have met?
If you can not enter Chinese on console's shell, refer to the section <ref id="input" name="Chinese Input Problems"> for detailed.

Or that you cannot enter Chinese in an editor, it is possible that your editor doesn't support Chinese. Please refer to the section <ref id="software" name="Useful Chinese Softwares"> to install Chinese-supported editors.
 
If this is matched at the period of telnet, then refer to the section <tt><ref id="telnet" name="telnet"></tt> for more explanations.

<sect1>I have got the NTU TTF fonts, but how can I decompress it? <label id="ntuttf">
<p><bf/Answer/:
The NTU TFF fonts is compressed with arj format and divided it into several files for the convenience of putting it into floppy disks, causing that decompression is a little trifling.
If you want <tt/ntu_kai.ttf/ font, for example, you must take <tt/ntu_kai.arj/, <tt/ntu_kai.a01/, <tt/ntu_kai.a02/, and <tt/ntu_kai.a03/ home.
Assuming that you have an arj tool of <bf/DOS/ version, put these four files altogether under the same directory and invoke this commands to decompress:
<tscreen><verb>
C:\> arj x -va -y ntu_kai
</verb></tscreen>

If you want to decompress them on Linux, you must use <tt/unarj/ to unarj them one by one, and then use <tt/cat/ to concatenate them together:
<tscreen><verb>
# unarj e ntu_kai.arj ; mv ntu_kai.ttf ntu_kai.ttf0
# unarj e ntu_kai.a01 ; mv ntu_kai.ttf ntu_kai.ttf1
# unarj e ntu_kai.a02 ; mv ntu_kai.ttf ntu_kai.ttf2
# unarj e ntu_kai.a03 ; mv ntu_kai.ttf ntu_kai.ttf3
# cat ntu_kai.ttf* > ntu_kai.ttf
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Netscape's title and tag cannot see Chinese? 
<p><bf/Answer/: 
To install CXWin will solve this problem. Refer to <ref id="cxwin" name="CXWin"> for detailed. 

<sect1>My Netscape cannot see Chinese?
<p>
<p><bf/Answer/: 
If you could not see any Chinese on all homepages, then you might probably not install Chinese fonts, or haven't make Netscape settled. Refer to the section <ref id="netscape" name="Netscape">.

But if you can see Chinese on most parts of Chinese homepages, only on some websites could see disturbed codes, then this may not be your private problems.
A little websites take Frontpage to generate homepages, and their language encoding is
<tt/x-x-big5/ not general <tt/big5/.

This wil make all browsers except IE cannot identify this encoding, which just a bad trick adopted by Microsoft to fulfill its ambitions to occupy the market of browsers.
To solve this problem, send a mail to the administrator of that site, telling them there are other browsers except IE all over the world. If they want to manage it perpetually, they should correct that unusual encoding to normal one.

Of course, if you have better solutions, please let me know of it.

<sect1>How to enter Chinese in Netscape?
<p>
<p><bf/Answer/: 
Install xcin+XA. Refer to this section <ref id="xa" name="XA">.

<sect1>What's the difference between ChiTeX and CJK? Can I install them at the same time?
<p><bf/Answer/: 
<itemize>    
<item> The system of Chinese reading and searching of CJK which is independent and efficnet is based on the NFSS of LaTeX. 
<item> CJK can use Chinese, Japanese, and Korean; and ChiTeX is just for BIG5. 
<item> CJK can only use on LaTeX while ChiTeX can use on plain TeX and LaTeX .
<item> Instructions of ChiTeX are simple and useful. 
<item> ChiTeX is approaching to real Chinese LaTeX. 
<item> Difference in functionality...
</itemize>
ChiTeX and CJK should be compatible while installing them at the same system, but if the <tt/ttf2pk/ has the same name for both ChiTeX and CJK, then it could cause certain problems.
A solution to this is that define the <tt/&dollar;PATH/ variable in each shell script, respectively, to point to the correct locations of <tt/ttf2pk/.
