One of the most memorable comments about software ever said is whether this or that piece of code can make coffee. Coffee is a world commodity that is second only to oil. 
Linux DOES make coffee; and it tastes good as well! </abstract>

<sect>Introduction
<p>
<nidx>coffee!introduction</nidx>
For a long time humanity has been wondering how could a computer make coffee...

People need coffee to wake up, and stay awake for a long time in front of the computer. 
It is common wisdom that coding is better at night!


The main trick is interfacing a coffee machine to the computer, 
so that it can be controlled by software. This HOWTO will show you how to do so.

At first, it demonstrates an ON/OFF switch implemented as an electronic circuit 
which controls the coffee-machine's power supply.
Another chapter will tell you the secrets of building 
intelligent, Turing Complete suitable, coffee machines!

This HOWTO was initially written as part of a debate in the mailing list linux-greek-users,
on whether linux can make coffee or not. It then became an article in our online magazine 
called <htmlurl url="http://magaz.hellug.gr" name="magaz">.
Just in case you wondered, magaz is in Greek and it will surely look like that to you!


Enjoy.

The Coffee HOWTO is now called Coffee Making HOWTO and heads for release v1.0, which will first appear somewhere here:

<htmlurl url="http://fotis.home.cern.ch/fotis/Coffee.html"  name="http://fotis.home.cern.ch/fotis/Coffee.html">.

It is about time for everyone to know that Coffee Making is just one of 
the standard features that come for free with *any* Linux distribution.
Or, does SCO have a patent on that, too? Gee...

<sect>Menu
<p>

<sect1>French
<p>Popular coffee among programmers because it doesn't need a lot of care
and its cooking is streamlined; just like commercial software.
Its exciting taste has inspired thousands of programmers
in writing incredible software, written in the very first hours of a day.
M$ Windows for example has been written at 5:00 o'clock in the morning,
only thanks to coffee! A similar result is guaranteed.

<sect1>Nescafe
<p> Nescafe is a rather strong coffee, made by pouring hot water
in a mixture of coffee, sugar and some water.
You usually take 1 spoon of coffee and 1 spoon of sugar with just
a bit of water, to mix it. In the meantime you should have the water
boiling. As soon as the water is hot enough, you mix them all together
and preferably add condensed milk.
Although you could use something simpler than a coffee-machine to
boil the water, I have seen this done so several times...

<sect1>Frappe'
<p>A popular variation of the above mentioned coffee.
Actually, you don't need a sophisticated coffee-machine, 
rather a refrigerator for cold water and ice-cubes. 
It is very popular in South Eastern Europe during the warm summer months.

<sect1>Freddo
<p>This is a complicated one, read coffee-faq (read further information)

<sect1>Espresso
<p>Espresso is a very strong, italian sort of coffee. 
You serve it in small cups (You ask why? See chapter: Overdose Symptomes) 
with one or two pieces of lump sugar. 
To produce a good espresso you need fresh grinded coffee beans,
water, lump sugar and a special machine. These machines boil the water
and press the very hot steam through the grinded coffee beans. You can
buy a super-duper-automatic machine for a lot of money. 
But a low cost machine is usable, too.
<p>
OK., lets start. Fill water in your machine. Let it become hot. In the
meantime fill about 1 teespoon of coffeepowder in the filterhandle of
your machine. Press the coffeepowder down. Not too much. Now the water
is at the right temperature. Attach the filterhandle to the machine
and let the machine work. After about 30 seconds you can serve a
delicate, hot espresso. It is fine after a good meal. You feel good
and can code for a few more hours. 


<sect1>Cappuccino
<p>(See also chapter: Espresso)
If you have a more profi-like machine, you can use it, to froth milk
with it. You need this feature to make a creamy sort of coffee. It is 
easy to prepare. Put some frothed milk in a coffee pot and fill it up
with espresso. Then decorade with some chocolade flakes. That's it.

A generic diagram could look like this:

|  PC   |====>====|Circuit|==========|Coffee-Machine|
---------         ---------          ----------------

</verb></tscreen>

<p>The concept is that we take a controling voltage from the computer,
which drives an electrically isolated circuit with a Relay or Triac.

<p>You must choose a Relay circuit, if you have a coffee-machine
greater than 200W. You can use a triac-based one if your coffee machine isn't high power.

All circuits presented are tested, but the results and risks are
YOUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY.
If you have no experience with electronics you should NOT try
building it on these, otherwise you may get a bad one...

<p>You should be very careful while experimenting with 220V, 
and using an appropriate fuse is absolutely advisable.

<sect1>Driving voltage 0-5V from the computer
<p>
Here is a simple example to get a voltage 0-5V from the parallel
port of the computer.

<sect1>Controlling with a Relay
<p>

The straight-forward circuit one can build is:

</verb></tscreen>
Connect Vcc with the same voltage as the relay type (usually 5 or 12V).
Obviously, the relay's specifications should be scaled for your
 coffee-machine.
<p>
Barmen, tend to put the relay AFTER the transistor, at the
emitter (E) pin instead of the collector (C) pin. This is bad practice
because it biases the transistor badly, and might result in bad coffee :-).
Diode 1N4002 is useful to protect the transistor from the relay's currents. 
If you don't use it the transistor will sooner become dark and smelly... 

<sect1>Controlling with TRIAC #1
<p>
If you only want a simple circuit, you can use Motorola's 
triac driver MOC301[012], together with a general purpose TRIAC like SC141D.
This method has the advantage that you don't need any extra power supply.

<p>For non-inductive loads, this is the circuitry:
<tscreen><verb>

                                                LOAD

</verb></tscreen>
<p>If you are going to work with 220V, try to obtain a 3021.
Inductive loads should be used in conjuction with bypass capacitors,
better consult <em>Motorola Application Note AN-780</em>.
Coffee-machines are mainly resistive loads and not inductive (like a motor), but who knows what yours is?

This design is for 120V. You should change resistors accordingly for 220V.

</verb></tscreen>
<p>Circuit description:
<P>The MC3032 is an optoisolator TRIAC driver. 
The 180-ohm resistor sets the current for the LED emitter in the optoisolator. 
Change the value of this resistor - if necessary - to get a reasonable current 
(e.g., 15 mA).
<P>
Note that you cannot test this circuit without a load.
The TRIAC will not switch unless connected to an AC
voltage source, so you can't test it for simple switching without applying AC 
and a load. Note the 500V rating on the .01 capacitor.



<!-- =========================== -->
<sect>Software
<p>

<sect1>Programming
<p>
You will have to build an executable that will take the following steps:
<itemize>
<item>Get permission to use I/O address space, by calling kernel, with
	the call <bf>ioperm</bf>: eg <em>ioperm( BASE, range ,1); </em>
<item>Perform an out request instruction, to set the 0-5V voltage to the
	parallel port, eg <em>outb( 1, BASE );</em>
<item>Wait enough time so the coffee is made. It would be nice
	if that time is read by looking at the command line.
<item>Then it will turn off the coffee-machine: outb( 0 , BASE );
<item>Before ending it should give back the parallel port  
	with an <em>ioperm( BASE, range, 0);</em>
</itemize>
Change BASE = 0x3bc for /dev/lp0, 0x378 for /dev/lp1, and 0x278
for /dev/lp2; range=8.

<p>It would be useful if you had that program setuid, 
so that everybody can drink coffee! You BOFH!

<sect1>Device driver
<p>

Just read <htmlurl
  url="http://en.tldp.org/LDP/khg/HyperNews/get/khg.html"
  name="kernel hacker's guide">,
to implement a device driver; you might also do it in user space. 
Please compile it as a module, so that we won't need a 
kernel compile in every update.
Then write:

<verb>
echo cappuccino >/dev/coffee
</verb>

And you will have a hot cup of coffee in minutes!
Remember to give the right permissions to /dev/coffee, 
depending on whether you want only root making coffee or not.

<p>The advantage of this method is that it supports feedback
from the coffee-machine by using the ACK of parallel port and such,
so that smart coffee-machines can produce an interrupt when ready.

<p>Do it yourself, after reading the excellent book 
of Alessandro Rubini and Jonathan Corbet
<htmlurl
  url="http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/index.html"
  name="Linux Device Drivers"> 
and studying the
<htmlurl
  url="http://lxr.linux.no/source/"
  name="Cross Reference Linux"> source code repository.


<sect1>Connecting with the Internet
<p>
If you have implemented the controlling program in C (see above),
you just have to write a CGI script to turn ON and OFF
the coffee-machine or pass along more complex instructions.
You should write some nice webpages, explaining how to make coffee,
and put them on an <bf>apache</bf> web server...

<p>
...LAMP technology (Linux, Apache, MySQL, [Perl|Python|PHP]),
will help you to build a perfect user-customizable coffee system!

At some time in the future when the applications get rather complex, 
you might want to extend on the basis of Flow-Based Programming:
<htmlurl  url="http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/"

What a great match for a great Coffee Machine!

<sect>Building the Turing Complete Coffee Machine
<p>

Do you pine for the nice old days, 
when men were men and build their own coffee machines?

<p>
This chapter is about assembling a smart, intelligent!, coffee machine.
It will be a computer designed with a von Neumann architecture, 
comprised of a CPU, ROM/RAM and I/O and will also be suitable
for generic use, a.k.a. Universal
<htmlurl  url="http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Turing_machine" name="Turing Machine">.


<!-- =========================== -->
<sect1>An adequate assembly language
<p>

Unlike other complex, but popular, systems that are either CISC or RISC, 
our machinery will be MISC: Mono-Instruction Set Computer!

Alas, our processor will understand just one command and yet, 
given enough memory and time, it is able to perform any action 
that your 3GHz Pentium IV could do, or just simulate it alltogether; 
It can solve any computable problem by running simple code like this:

<tscreen><verb>

SBN	$mem1, $addr1
SBN	$mem2, $addr2
SBN	$mem3, $addr3
SBN	$mem4, $addr4
SBN	$mem5, $addr5
SBN	$mem6, $addr6
[...]

</verb></tscreen>

<p>
The magic command is called SBN $mem, $addr (Subtract and Branch if Negative),
and does take the value of a memory cell $mem, subtract it from the
accumulator (A is the only available register in this architecture) 
and store it back to the accumulator and memory $mem <em>: [mem] <= A <= A-[mem]</em>.
If the result is negative, and only then, 
it jumps to the designated address $addr.
If $addr points to the next command, there is no conditional jump.
Now, with that command at hand you can subtract, add, 
zero memory addresses, move bytes around, multiply, 
compare and so on, so forth.
What's best of all, you can easily build an optimizing compiler.

<p>
Voila. This is a great system for any Turing Complete problems plus, 
it is even simpler in coding than the original Turing Machine!

<!-- =========================== -->
<sect1>Hardware and interfacing
<p>

The great thing with this innovative MISC processor is that you need
0 bits to store the opcode of your commands. This makes your CPU
much, much simpler: you only have to read a couple of operands each time.
You might wish to extend the capabilities of your processor 
by extending the SBN instruction to 3 or 4 operands,
so that it can directly load and store data from main memory.
This is an exercise left to the reader; kudos to

The CPU diagram looks like this:

<tscreen><verb>

<========= ADDRESS BUS ==============>
        =                =
        =  +---------+   =
        =  | CONTROL |   =
   +---------+  +-----------------+
   | ALU & A |  | Program Counter |
   +---------+  +-----------------+
        =  |  LOGIC  |   =
        =  +---------+   =
        =                =
<=========== DATA BUS ===============>

</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Now, all you have to do is just hook together some memory chips,
for example by recycling static cache RAM from old 386 PCs,
an ALU and a few glue components. You may pick one of
TTL or CMOS for logic gates and latches; I'm a CMOS guy,
but this really depends on your favourite flavor.
You may build an 8, 16, 32, 64 bit or whatever width system you need.
Just in case, for larger word widths, I have found preferable building 
the ALU with pre-programmed 27128 EPROMS instead of the harder-to-find 74x181s. Look around for a carry propagation unit, too.

<p>
The monolithic nature of this system allows only memory-mapped I/O,
and requires special design provisions for bidirectional interfacing,
but nothing more peculiar than what is seen in older-generation systems.
<htmlurl url="http://www.sandroid.org/Apollo/"  name="AGC">, 
the computer that drove Apollo 11 mission to the moon was making use
of such techniques, so it should be sufficient in this case, too.

<p>
Note that the data bus has to be exactly as wide as the address bus,
that implies that the notion of a byte is only applicable to 8 bit coffee machines,
which you will eventually find that it is more of a feature than a bug.
You will be surprised with what a coffee you can have for 8 or 16 bits bus!
It is really a general-purpose piece of hardware, built for peanuts.


<sect1>Software
<p>
Such a pure system will make a good fit together with the,
famous for embedded systems controlling,
<htmlurl
  url="http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Forth_programming_language"
  name="FORTH"> programming language.
The major prerequisite for doing so is to have a stack mechanism, 
which in this case can be constructed by a counter 
combined together with a memory pool.

If you want to claim a serious coffee development platform,
C portability is an absolute must nowadays. 
Your choices might be hacking one of gcc, lcc or sdcc,
which with proper tweaking at the back-ends will be able 
to spit out the specially crafted MISC assembly code.
One day you might even want to rewrite another language like C,
forget the D letter - it is taken already, 
so do not make again the same mistakes with your compiler please:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/projects/beginner.html

<p>
Just in case you thought of writing your own compiler, please read 
in advance about flex, yacc and just a little bit of related theory.
In particular you will quickly appreciate Noam Chomsky's taxonomy on languages:
<itemize>
<item>regular grammars (the abstract formalism for regular expressions), 
<item>context free grammars (any BNF-described language is such)
</itemize>so on, so forth. Read ahead on

<sect1>A minor criticism on the Turing Machine
<p>
Because of the way a Turing Machine works (see for that
<htmlurl
   url="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-machine/"
  name="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-machine/"> ), it is 
a very complicated device to program, and debug at the end of the day.
The reason is, that its behavior is a sequential process
that is completely determined by the following parameters: 
<itemize>
<item>(1) the State the machine is in, 
<item>(2) the Symbol (or number) on the square it is scanning, and 
<item>(3) a Table of Instructions
</itemize>

The major contemporary disadvantage of the Turing Machine (TM) is that 
it is of sequential nature, which implies that only a particular
range of problems can be mapped to it in a straightforward way.
TMs are suitable for problems that are described well on a serial
storage medium (tapes) and don't make use of indexes for data reference.
This is in contrast to the Coffee Machine (CM) that can handle any
Random Access algorithms as well (with no compromise of simplicity).

Add to this, that TMs impose a very high and unnecessary
complexity on item (3) in favor of keeping (1) and (2) simple.
And just in case you don't agree that the so called 
Table of Instructions gets trully overwhelmed, 
have you ever tried to write a compiler for a Turing Machine?
A system that isn't easily programmable and is hard to debug, 
should be considered a seriously questionable system, 
at least as far as Computer Engineering (!= CS) is concerned.
For instance, try to simulate the Coffee Machine with a Turing Machine and vice versa.
Hey, if you still disagree, show me the code.

Bottom Line:
The Coffee Machine (CM), is a much better model for the von Neumann
architecture and has a O(1) relationship with what is standard practice
of weighting algorithms, in the current form of complexity theory.

<itemize>
<item>All hardware and software described here, can be expanded so that
it will support toast, beaf, applepies, etc.
<item>Cluster with 8 coffee-machines. This will let you have coffee
even when the first one gets off. Of course there will be a perfomance hit.
<item>Parallel vector coffee-machine will be a future release.
<item>If you want the maximum automation you'll need more circuits and
sensors, so that you can control water flow, temperature, coffee
quantity etc.
<item>In the near future we will implement SNMP features.
<item>Serial coffee-machine at 115Kbps.
