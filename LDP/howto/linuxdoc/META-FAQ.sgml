This is the Meta-FAQ for Linux.  It is mainly a list of valuable
sources of information.  Check these sources out if you want to learn
more about Linux, or have problems and need help.

<sect>Introduction
<p><descrip>
<tag/What is Linux?/
   Linux is an independent implementation of the POSIX operating system
   specification, with SYSV and BSD extensions, that has been written
   entirely from scratch (this means it looks and acts just like Unix).
   It has no proprietary code in it.  Linux is freely
   distributable under the GNU General Public License.

   Linux works on IBM PC
   compatibles with an ISA or EISA bus (including local bus variants VLB
   and PCI) and a 386 or higher processor.
   Some Amiga and Atari computers with MMU's are also supported.
   This means 68020 with an external MMU, 68030, 68040, or 68060.
   Support for the Digital Alpha is now stable.
   Red Hat and Craftworks have Alpha distributions of Linux.
   Support for Sparc is stable, and Red Hat Linux is available for Sparc.
   Support for PowerPC is in development for multiple platforms,
   including Nubus and PCI Macintosh, Motorola Powerstack, IBM
   830 and 850, and other platforms.
   Support for ARM, StrongARM, and MIPS is in various stages of
   completion, but don't hold your breath.
   Read comp.os.linux.announce instead.

   See the Linux INFO-SHEET for more technical information on these
   ports, and the Hardware Compatibility HOWTO for more exact hardware
   requirements.

   The Linux kernel
   is written by Linus Torvalds &lt;torvalds@transmeta.com&gt;
   and other volunteers.  Most of the programs running under
   Linux are generic Unix freeware, many of them from the GNU project.

<tag/The Linux INFO-SHEET/
   More specific technical information on Linux.  Includes pointers
   to information on the various ports, a feature list, information
   about how to get Linux, and more.

<tag/The Linux HOWTO's/
   These are somewhat like FAQ's, but instead of answering common
   questions, they explain how to do common tasks, like ordering
   a release of Linux, setting up print services under Linux,
   setting up a basic UUCP feed, etc.  See
   <url url="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX.html"> or
   <url url="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/">
   for the definitive versions
   of all the HOWTO's.  Other sites with up-to-date copies of
   the HOWTOs are ftp.cc.gatech.edu and tsx-11.mit.edu.

   In addition, there are many short, free-form documents called
   "mini-HOWTOs".  These documents cover very specific subjects,
   such as BogoMIPS or Color-ls.  These are available at
   <url url="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini/">
   and at
   <url url="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX.html">.

<tag/Linux newsgroups/
   There are several Usenet newsgroups for Linux.
   It is a good idea to follow at least comp.os.linux.announce if you
   use Linux.  comp.os.linux.announce is moderated by
   Lars Wirzenius.  To make submissions to the newsgroup, send mail to
   linux-announce@news.ornl.gov.  You may direct questions about
   comp.os.linux.announce to Lars Wirzenius &lt;wirzeniu@iki.fi&gt;

   The newsgroup comp.os.linux.announce is a moderated
   newsgroup for announcements about Linux (new programs, bug
   fixes, etc).

   The newsgroup comp.os.linux.answers is a moderated newsgroup
   to which the Linux FAQ, HOWTO documents, and other
   documentation postings are made.

   The newsgroup comp.os.linux.setup is an unmoderated newsgroup
   for discussion of issues and problems involved in setting up
   Linux systems.

   The newsgroup comp.os.linux.admin is an unmoderated
   newsgroup for discussion of administration of Linux systems.

   The newsgroup comp.os.linux.development.system is an
   unmoderated newsgroup specifically for discussion of Linux
   <bf/kernel/ development.  The only application development
   questions that should be discussed here are those that are
   intimately associated with the kernel.  All other
   development questions are probably generic Unix development
   questions and should be directed to a comp.unix group
   instead, unless they are very Linux-specific applications
   questions, in which case they should be directed at
   comp.os.linux.development.apps.

   The newsgroup comp.os.linux.development.apps is an
   unmoderated newsgroup specifically for discussion of
   Linux-related applications development.  It is not for
   discussion of where to get applications for Linux, nor a
   discussion forum for those who would like to see
   applications for Linux.

   The newsgroup comp.os.linux.hardware is for Linux-specific
   hardware questions.

   The newsgroup comp.os.linux.networking is for Linux-specific
   networking development and setup questions.

   The newsgroup comp.os.linux.x is for Linux-specific X
   Windows questions.

   The newsgroup comp.os.linux.misc is an unmoderated newsgroup for any
   Linux discussion that doesn't belong anywhere else.

   In general, <bf/do not/ crosspost between the Linux newsgroups.
   The <bf/only/ crossposting that is appropriate is an occasional
   posting between one unmoderated group and comp.os.linux.announce.  The
   whole point of splitting the old comp.os.linux group into many groups
   was to reduce
   traffic in each.  Those that do not follow this rule will be flamed
   without mercy...

<tag/Other newsgroups/

   Do not assume that all your questions are appropriate for a Linux
   newsgroup just because you are running Linux.  Is your question
   really about shell programming under any unix or unix clone?  Then
   ask in comp.unix.shell.  Is it about GNU Emacs?  Then try asking in
   gnu.emacs.help.  Also, if you don't know another group to ask in, but
   think there might be, politely ask in your post if there is another
   group that would be more appropriate for your question.  At least
   the groups comp.unix.{questions,shell,programming,bsd,admin} and
   comp.windows.x.i386unix should be useful for a Linux user.

<tag/The World-Wide Web/

   Greg Hankins &lt;gregh@cc.gatech.edu&gt; maintains the home WWW page for
   the Linux project.  The URL is <url url="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/">

<tag/Linux Journal/

   A magazine called <em/Linux Journal/ was launched several
   years ago.  It includes articles intended for almost all
   skill levels, and is intended to be helpful to all Linux
   users.  Subscriptions are &dollar;22 in the U.S., &dollar;27
   in Canada and Mexico, and &dollar;32 elsewhere around the
   world, all payable in U.S. funds. Subscription inquiries can
   be sent via email to subs@ssc.com or faxed to (U.S.)
   1-206-782-7191 or mailed to Linux Journal, PO Box 85867,
   Seattle, WA 98145-1867 USA.  SSC has a PGP public key if
   you wish to send your credit card number via encrypted
   email: finger info@ssc.com

<tag/The Linux Software Map/

<sect>Getting Linux
<sect1>Linux FTP sites
<p>
A more complete list of Linux FTP sites is in the Linux INFO-SHEET,
which can always be found at
<url url="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/INFO-SHEET.html">
The most important sites are listed here; please 
see the INFO-SHEET for a site nearer to you (there are many mirrors).

These sites are the main ``home'' sites for Linux where most uploads take
place. There are many mirror sites; please use the closest (network-wise)
site to you.

<sect1>Linux on physical media
<p>
Linux is distributed on physical media, mainly CD-ROM,
by several commercial vendors.  Please read the distribution
HOWTO, posted regularily to comp.os.linux.announce, and available at
<url url="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Distribution-HOWTO.html">

<sect1>AFS
<p>
Linux is available over AFS by mounting the
volume project.linux from sipb.mit.edu

<sect1>Commercial networks
<p>
Compu&dollar;erve has some Linux archives.

<sect1>Mailservers and such
<p>
Sunsite offers ftp-mail service --- mail &lt;ftpmail@sunsite.unc.edu&gt;.

<sect>Linux distributions
<p>
Linux is distributed by its author only as a kernel.  Other people have
put together ``distributions'' that pair the Linux kernel with utilities
and application software to make a complete working package.

There are several distributions of Linux, which are available at
various sites.  Sunsite mirrors many of the distributions at
<url url="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/distributions/">.
The most commonly-recommended freely-available distributions are
Red Hat <url url="http://www.redhat.com"> and
Debian <url url="http://www.debian.org">.  These are available for
free over the internet, and are also sold on CD-ROM.

There are other distributions of Linux as well. Most commercial
distributors of Linux advertise in <em/Linux Journal/.

<sect>Linux mailing-lists
<p>
Used mostly for discussion between developers of new features and testers
of pre-release versions.  See addresses in the FAQ.
Send mail to majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu with the single word
<tt/help/ in the body of the message , and you will get
mail explaining how to subscribe to the many Linux mailing
lists there.
Save this mail, as it tells you how to unsubscribe from the lists,
and if you post annoying messages to the list complaining
about not being able to get off the list (because you didn't follow
instructions and save the mail telling you how to unsubscribe), you
will likely be flamed for wasting international bandwidth and money.

<sect>Documentation for various programs
<p>
Many programs come with some sort of documentation, often in a file called
README or something similar.  It is a VERY good idea to read them with
care.  It is boring to see (and answer) questions that are answered in
the documentation.  Most programs also have ``man pages''; use the command
<tt/man programname/ to get documentation on a program named
<tt/programname/.  To get help using the man program, use
<tt/man man/.

Most distributions put other documentation about programs in the
directory /usr/doc/; your distribution should include documentation
on how to access that documentation.

<sect>More Documentation
<p>
The Linux Documentation Project is working on a lot of
documentation.  Already, over 3000 pages of book-style documentation
has been released to the general public, and another 2000 or so printed
pages of man pages
have also been released, with more to follow.  Check
<url url="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/"> for documents written by the LDP.

<sect>Keeping track of current releases
<p>
Important new releases, programs,
and ports are usually announced in comp.os.linux.announce.

<sect>This Document
