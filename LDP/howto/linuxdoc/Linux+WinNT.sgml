This mini-HOWTO covers some ways on how to install both Linux 
and Windows NT on the same computer and how to boot either of
them from within LILO menu. There is also another mini-HOWTO 
"Linux+NT-Loader" that covers how to boot either of them from
within NT Loader menu. As I consider Windows 2000 to be Windows NT 
version 5.0 this mini-HOWTO also covers upgrading from NT 4.0 to
2000.</abstract>

<sect>Introduction

<p>
Bill Wohler wrote in his v1.1 of The Linux+WindowsNT mini-HOWTO:
<p>
<em>"Due to hardware or software problems or user headroom, I pulled my
  hair out for several days trying to get both NT and Linux happily
  settled on my new HP Vectra PC at work."</em>

I could say that was true in my case too, but you <bf/really/ have
a way to make both Linux and Windows NT co-existing on the same
machine and to switch from one of them to another.

<p>
<em>"Under no circumstances run the Disk Administrator from NT 3.51 to
  format partitions.  It asks if it can write a signature "which will
  cause absolutely no harm."  When it did this, it hosed my partition
  table until fixed by steps 3 and 7 below.  Because of these
  problems, I was limited to one FAT NT partition.  Also remember that
  even if you do get the Disk Administrator to work, you'll want at
  least one small FAT partition to use as a staging area for
  exchanging files between Linux and NT until Linux has an NTFS
  filesystem."</em>

Well, NT's Disk Administrator is sufficient tool to check what
situation on your hard disk(s) you have, before and after you used
an utility called Partition Magic by Power Quest. This utility
might be needed to 'shrink' your NT (either NTFS or FAT) partition,
in order to get some free space for your further Linux' partitions.
(After a while, I recognized that 'shrinking' used partition
might not be needed. Actually, if you start from 'scratch', it 
might be the best way to re-format your whole disk(s) using 
<bf>FDISK</bf> command. You should make a DOS boot floppy diskette 
where DOS commands FDISK and FORMAT have to be also copied. 
More details later...)

<em>"I installed Linux first and then NT, but based on my experience, I
  might now be able to install NT first and then Linux."</em>

Of course you all are able to install Windows NT first and after that
Linux. We'll see how to do that and how to use <bf/LILO/ (<bf/Li/nux
<bf/Lo/ader) to chose which operating system to boot. But, before that
we'll see the procedure that Bill Wohler, the previous maintainer of
this mini-HOWTO, has been using:


<sect>How to install: LINUX <em>first</em>, WINDOWS NT <em>after</em>

<p>
 1. Install a minimal Linux (hold off on installing the rest until
  you win the Linux/NT battle).  Do all your disk partitioning in
  Linux, including your NT partition (make it FAT).  I was not
  successful at making more than one NT partition.  I also made it the
  first partition, but I don't know if that is essential or not.

<p>  
  2. Edit <tt>/etc/lilo.conf</tt> and use <bf>boot=/dev/sda</bf> (I 
  was not successful
  at installing LILO on the Linux partition--<tt>/dev/sda3</tt> in my case) and
  run "lilo".  You'll have to use the editor ae.  You'll live.

<p>
  3. Save the MBR with this: <bf>dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/fd0 bs=512 count=1</bf>
  Use a floppy.  Trust me.  Also do this each time you change the disk
  partition table.

<p>
  4. Install NT, part 1.  When it goes to reboot halfway through the
  process you'll boot into Linux.

<p>  
  5. Add NT stanza to /etc/lilo.conf, e.g.:
  
<verb>
        other=/dev/sda1
	label=NT
	table=/dev/sda
</verb>

<p>
  and run lilo.  If lilo complains about this (I forget the message),
  add the "linear" flag to /etc/lilo.conf near the "compact" keyword.
  Furthermore, if your partition table is screwed up by NT you'll
  either need to use "ignore-table" or follow the directions in Step 7.
  See also "fix-table".  The LILO HOWTO is your friend.

<p>  
  6. Reboot, select NT from LILO, and finish NT install.  You'll need
  the "Boot Disk XU, HP Vectra AIC 7880 Driver A.01.02" floppy to
  install the ethernet drivers and the "XU/VT Drivers and
  Documentation" CD (directory video/disk4 if I recall correctly) to
  install the video drivers for the Matrox MGA Millennium.

<p>  
  7. Back to Linux, run fdisk and ensure you don't get "partition
  doesn't end on cylinder boundary" on your Linux partitions.  You'll
  still have this error on the NT partition though, but this seems to
  be OK.

<p>
<verb>  
/dev/sda1            1        1      322   329301    6  DOS 16-bit >=32M
</verb>

<p>
Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary:

<p>
     phys=(321, 39, 9) should be (321, 63, 32)
<p>
  Cfdisk reports strangeness, but it seems OK:

<verb>
                                          Unusable                      0.04*

 /dev/sda1                 Primary        DOS 16-bit >=32Mb           321.59*

                                          Unusable                      0.39*
</verb>

<p>
  If you do get the cylinder boundary warning on your Linux
  partitions, it is sufficient to use cfdisk to do something innocuous
  like changing the boot sector.

<p>  
  If, however, NT has really screwed you over and cfdisk can't even
  run, complaining that it cannot open /dev/sda, then you'll need to
  take more extreme action.  You'll need that MBR you saved
  previously.  Clear and restore the MBR (but not the signature) with:

<p>
<verb>
	  dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1

	  dd if=/dev/fd0 of=/dev/sda bs=510 count=1
</verb>

<p>
  8.  Install the rest of Linux.  Easy, huh?

  If you prefer to have NT write the MBR instead of LILO, you may have
  to resort to the following to clear the MBR first:

<itemize>  

<item>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=446 count=1 (in Linux) or perform
     a low-level format with the SCSI utilities.  I've heard that a
     low-level format of an IDE disk is fatal, so don't do it.

<p>
<item>fdisk /mbr (you've obviously already created a DOS boot 
     disk that contains fdisk).

<p>
<item>delete NT partition and create it again in NT install.

<p>
<item>continue with NT install.

</itemize>

<p>
  Epilogue: After first posting this message, I heard from several
  folks that they had no problems with NT's Disk Administrator, and
  were able to install either NT or Linux first without any problems.
  Hopefully, you'll be in this camp, but if not, perhaps this campfire
  story will be of some use.

<p>
  Since the first edition of this mini-HOWTO, others have written
  similar documents as well.  Please be sure to consult them.  If your
  experience differs from any presented, then you should submit your
  own mini-HOWTO or submit a revised version of this document to the
  HOWTO maintainer (reference this sentence) and send a carbon copy to
  me as I don't have the time to maintain this document.  Someone
  should eventually combine all of these documents into a single
  coherent HOWTO.

<p>
  Finally, I'm afraid this document details all I know about this
  subject.  I should point you to an appropriate Linux newsgroup for
  further information.  I use NT about one day a year.  Under duress.


<sect>How to install: WINDOWS NT <em>first</em>, LINUX <em>after</em>

<p>
<sect1>If you have <em>only one</em> IDE hard disk

<p>
<itemize>

<item>First of all, I would suggest you to install a fresh copy of
      Windows NT 4.0 on your hard disk. I suppose that you already
      made a backup of your important data, so the NT installation
      shouldn't be a problem. During the NT installation, setup is
      not going to ask you where to place NT's boot loader, so it
      would be placed into the MBR (Master Boot Record) of your hard
      disk. But, there is a possibility for a previous content of
      the MBR to remain within the MBR (especially any previous
      Lilo), so I would suggest you (<em>before</em> installation of NT) to
      boot the computer with a DOS floppy diskette having DOS version
      of FDISK. At the prompt a:\  just enter the command: 
      <bf>fdisk /mbr</bf> and restart the computer again (without 
      that floppy).

<p>
<item>After you have successfully installed your NT, you will see that
      it uses the whole hard disk or a specific partition of the hard
      disk (depending on what you decided during the setup process).
      So, it is advisable to 'shrink' the partition where NT resides
      in order to make some free space on the disk. Onto that free space
      you will install your Linux. After you have your NT configured
      and running, you have to boot your computer using a floppy
      diskette with Partition Magic utility by Power Quest. It is a
      graphical tool able to see all partitions on all hard disks you
      have. The best thing is that you can make some changes with your
      partitions but <em>not</em> to destroy your existing data. One of the
      available changes is to make your existing partition(s) smaller,
      so to get some free space on the disk(s) for other purposes.
      Although you are advised to make a backup before you make any
      changes to the partitions, I usually practice to 'shrink' NT's
      partition(s) before I install anything else onto this NT (so, if
      needed, a repetitive NT re-installation wouldn't be a problem).
      Well, Partition Magic (or any other similar utility you are
      familiar with) will shrink your NT's partition (either NTFS or
      FAT) to a smaller measure and place it to either the beginning
      or to the end of the previous measure. It means that you may
      choose to have your 'shrinked' NT partition at the beginning
      or at the end of your disk (I usually choose NT to be at the
      beginning, so the ending part of the disk will become a 'free
      space'). After the 'shrinking' is finished, you may re-boot your
      NT in order to check the new situation: you may use Windows
      Explorer or Disk Administrator for that.

<p>
<item>As it was said in Introduction, it might <em>not</em> be needed
      always to use such tools like Partition Magic. It is better to say 
      that this tool is of a great value in all those cases you have been
      running Windows NT for a long time, so you don't want to start
      from 'scratch'. For example, you are fully satisfied with your
      beloved NT and related applications. You are not likely to kill
      NT, but you have recognized that you have enough <em>unused</em> 
      space on NT's partition(s) (i.e. NT's partition(s) might look not 
      much populated). That case, Partition Magic is your choice.

      But, if you do start from the beginning, or you don't mind
      re-formatting the disk, it might be suitable to get a blank
      floppy diskette, make it to be DOS bootable and copy two DOS
      tools on it: FDISK and FORMAT. So, restart your computer with
      such floppy and at <bf>A:\</bf> prompt enter <bf>fdisk</bf>.
      There you'll find several options that allow re-partition of
      your hard disk(s). Now you could make a part of the disk a FAT
      partition (where you'll later install your beloved NT). The rest
      of space you'd better leave alone (i.e. do not attempt making 
      Linux partition(s) right now, using DOS's version of FDISK). If
      you <em>really</em> want to make Linux-type partitions now, you
      should look after Linux version of FDISK.

<p>
<item>So far so good. Next step is to install your Linux. Case you 
      are familiar with RedHat distribution (I hope with other distros
      is the same or similar), you start by putting your installation
      CD in the drive and re-boot the computer). Well, when you are about
      to choose what type of installation it will be (Gnome or KDE 
      Workstation, Custom, etc.) you may choose whatever you planned
      before, but I would suggest to install a Workstation <em>at first</em>.
      This is good because Linux setup will find <em>automatically</em> the
      free space on the (first) hard disk, make all partitions needed
      for Linux, format them properly, make majority of options by
      default so you won't have much pain during the setup (<em>later</em>, 
      if you want, you may either <bf>add</bf> missing components or 
      <bf>re-install</bf> RedHat Linux as Custom over the existing linux 
      partitions). Lilo should go to the MBR.

<p>
<item><bf>Don't forget to make Linux boot floppy diskette. You'll never
      know when you may need it. If something goes wrong with the MBR, 
      and you don't have boot floppy, your Linux might become not accessible,
      so you might have to re-install it again.</bf>

<p>
<item>After it looks that Linux installation is finished, you are going
      to re-start the computer and there you will only see <bf>Lilo</bf>
      with only one entry to boot: Linux (or maybe more than one Linux
      entry, in case your hardware is multi-processor one or so). But, don't
      panic! Your Windows NT is still there - where you had installed it
      before Linux. You should become some familiar with Linux as soon
      as possible, in order to be able to find and edit your new
      <bf>/etc/lilo.conf</bf> file. When you open this file for the first time,
      you'll see that there is only one (or more) Linux entry. Well,
      you should know the exact position (read: a partition) where
      Windows NT has been installed, so you could add an appropriate
      entry into <tt>/etc/lilo.conf</tt> file. After you make those changes, 
      restart Lilo with a command: <bf>/sbin/lilo</bf> and, after the next 
      re-boot, you will have both 'linux' and 'nt' (or 'dos' or similar)
      entries under Lilo menu. 

<p>
<item>My added NT entry is:

<p>
<verb>
      other=/dev/hda1
      label=nt
</verb>

<p>
      So, the whole <tt>/etc/lilo.conf</tt> looks like this:

<p>
<verb>
      boot=/dev/hda
      timeout=50
      prompt
          default=linux
          vga=normal
          read-only
      image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.12-20
          label=linux
          root=/dev/hda3
      other=/dev/hda1
          label=nt
</verb>

<p>
<item>Some more explanations regarding details from my <tt>/etc/lilo.conf</tt>
      file: After I have installed Windows NT, I assigned the letter C: 
      to that drive. Beside that, I wanted to have another NTFS
      partition in order to store and backup important files, case I
      have to re-install NT on C: for some reason in the future. That's why 
      I've made another NT partition, that has been assigned as D: disk.
      Both NTFS partitions are approximatelly 3 GB each and Linux setup
      found them as /dev/hda1 and /dev/hda2 partitions. The rest free space
      on the disk was cca. 2 GB, where I have made the /root partition of
      near 1.9 GB and /swap part of cca. 100 MB (/dev/hda3 and /dev/hda4
      respectively). Lilo went to the MBR and all has been running fine.

<p>
      For your information, I <em>wanted</em> to make these linux
      partitions that time. Later, I found that it was not needed, so
      now I let Linux setup to make partitions from the free space in
      a way it likes to do that. I trust it :-)

</itemize>

<sect1>If you have <em>more than one</em> (SCSI) hard disk 

<p>
<em>Notice: Folks, you see, at my place, one of computers has several
SCSI disks. That's why I put the word 'SCSI' in parentheses. There I
have a couple of SCSI controllers, a SCSI CD ROM drive and a SCSI 
Tape drive. That doesn't mean that *you* will be using SCSI parts at all.
You'd rather handle more than one IDE disks, but I hope that install
process shouldn't change too much, if any. 
</em>

<p>
<itemize>

<item>First of all, I would suggest you to install a fresh copy of
      Windows NT 4.0 on your <bf/first/ hard disk. I suppose that you already
      made a backup of your important data, so the NT installation
      shouldn't be a problem. You can easily copy your data on your 
      second hard disk or so. During the NT installation, setup is
      not going to ask you where to place NT's boot loader, so it
      would be placed into the MBR (Master Boot Record) of your <bf/first/ hard
      disk. But, there is a possibility for a previous content of
      the MBR to remain within the MBR (especially any previous
      Lilo), so I would suggest you (before installation of NT) to
      boot the computer with a DOS floppy diskette having DOS version
      of FDISK. At the prompt a:\  just enter the command: fdisk /mbr  
      and restart the computer again (without that floppy). If you
      want to be sure about your machine is 'clean', you may also
      delete any existing partition(s) on your <em>other</em> disks, during the
      Windows NT Setup <bf/in case you have *not* made any backup on
      other disks/. 

<p>
<item>After you have successfully installed your NT, you will see that
      it uses the whole hard disk or a specific partition of the hard
      disk (depending on what you decided during the setup process).
      So, it is advisable to 'shrink' the partition where NT resides
      in order to make some free space on the disk. Onto that free space
      you will install your Linux. Well, you may also think of using
      other disk(s) you have for Linux (so did I). That case, you
      would start your linux installation and tried to use, for example,
      /dev/sdb (or sdc, or sdd, or else in case of SCSI system) or
      /dev/hdb (or hdc, or hdd, or else in case of IDE system). Looked
      that Linux installation accepted whatever I chose, but somehow
      after all was finished, when I did that, LILO was not able to
      do anything. Actually, it always stopped after 'LI' so it was not
      possible to start Linux at all. Finally, after pulling my hair
      out, I decided to make it all on the  <bf/first/ disk. So, after
      I had NT configured and running, I had to boot my computer using
      a floppy diskette with Partition Magic utility by Power Quest.
      It is a graphical tool able to see all partitions on all hard disks you

      Although you are advised to make a backup before you make any
      changes with your partitions, I usually practice to 'shrink' NT's
      partition <em>before</em> I install anything but NT itself (so, if
      needed, a repetitive re-installation wouldn't be a problem).
      Well, Partition Magic (or any other similar utility you are
      familiar with) will shrink your NT's partition (either NTFS or
      FAT) to a smaller measure and place it to either the beginning
      or to the end of the previous measure. It means that you may
      choose to have your 'shrinked' NT partition at the beginning
      or at the end of your disk. I usually choose NT to be at the
      beginning, so the ending part of the disk will become a 'free
      space'. I discovered some problems if the 'free space' is made
      at the beginning of disk (later we'll talk about). So, after the 
      'shrinking' is finished, you may re-boot your
      NT in order to check the new situation: you may use Windows
      Explorer or Disk Administrator for that. You will also note how
      NT can 'see' all (other) disks you have in your machine (either
      partitioned or as 'free space' areas).

<p>
<item>Once again, as it was said earlier, it might <em>not</em> be needed
      always to use such tools like Partition Magic. It is better to say 
      that this tool is of a great value in all those cases you have been

          root=/dev/sda6
      other=/dev/hda1
          label=nt
</verb>

<p>
<item>Some more explanation, regarding details from my <tt>/etc/lilo.conf</tt>
      file: After I have installed Windows NT on the <bf/first/ disk, 
      I assigned the letter C: to that drive. After I made enough free
      space <em>after</em> the NTFS partition, I let Linux setup to
      handle further partitioning. Although Linux should support as far
      as four primary partitions per disk, it seems that Linux setup is
      likely to make an extended partition, whenever it recognizes that
      there is already a primary partition on the disk. Considering that
      those 'virtual' primary partitions would be numbered from /dev/sda1
      to /dev/sda4 (including an extended one, of course), the extended
      one should become /dev/sda4. Following that idea, the first one logical
      partition within the extended one was numbered as /dev/sda5 (in my
      case, it was the /boot partition that physically was the first from
      the beginning of the <bf/first/ hard disk). So, the /root and /swap
      partitions are /dev/sda6 and /dev/sda7 respectively. You may see a line
      "root=/dev/sda6" telling you that. Once again, Lilo went to the MBR
      and all has been running fine.

<p>
<item>Well, you may ask me: OK, but what in a case I have several
      hard disks installed in the machine? Good question. You see, I
      myself have <em>four</em> SCSI disks and, of course, I tried to
      install Linux on the 2nd one, next the 3rd and, finally, on the
      4th disk. Whatever I did (Linux setup haven't complained at all),
      when I was about to finish the installation and after performing the
      final automatic re-boot, my Lilo would stop after 'LI' so the
      computer had to be re-started. Finally, I realized that there
      must be a problem with disks that are too "far" from the MBR that is
      located at the beginning of the <bf/first/ hard disk. That's why
      I suggest you to make them all (both NT and Linux) on your <bf/first/
      disk. After having all of them running OK, there is no problem
      to make other disks visible (and usable) by both operating
      system. I hope your <bf/first/ disk is large enough to carry
      both operating systems (NT needs at least cca. 150 MB for itself,
      Linux depends on what you want to get: Gnome or KDE Workstations
      are about 580 MB, but the Custom wants more than 1.4 GB). That
      means the <bf/first/ hard disk of cca. 2.4 GB should fit.  

<p>
<item>You may also ask me: OK, but, could I 'shrink' my NT partition in 
      a way the 'free space' is made at the beginning of the disk? Well, I
      remember I tried to do so and to install, at first, Gnome
      Workstation (395 packages, 570 MB) there. During the setup, everything
      looked fine, but neither Lilo was not installed, nor the boot floppy
      was made. You bet, Linux was not functional. Then I tried to install
      KDE Workstation (377 packages, 582 MB) on the same place. Once again,
      everything looked fine, but neither Lilo was not installed, nor the
      boot floppy was made. Investigating that, I studied the structure of all
      existing partitions. I was surprised when recognized that new born
      <em>logical</em> partitions (within the new born <em>extended</em> one) 
      were numbered as if they were physically positioned <em>after</em> the 
      NT partition! In the other words, there I have got a 'funny' order: 
      /dev/sda5, /dev/sda6, /dev/sda7 and, finally, /dev/sda1. Looked like 
      the system was a bit confused. So I considered that it is advisable
      to make the 'free space' <bf>after</bf> already existing NT 
      partition(s).

<p>
<item>Regarding two similar Linux images (differ in 'smp'). It is a server
      hardware with a multi-processor support. The "intelligent" setup has
      inspected the hardware and offered me to have both 'multi' and 'uni'
      processor functionality. Nevertheless, I still have only one CPU
      there.

<sect>How to <em>upgrade</em> WINDOWS NT to WINDOWS 2000

<p>
<em>Well, actually, it isn't a real "upgrade" of <bf>running</bf> NT to
    2000, but a "fresh" installation of Windows 2000 Professional.
    I hope it should also work for other Windows 2000 products. I
    haven't tried its server-type installations yet, but I remember I 
    haven't experienced any problem with NT, regarding it was Server
    or Workstation.</em>

<p>
<itemize>

<item>First of all, a backup of important data should be made! I do it
      by having another Windows-like partition on the disk, where I
      copy/move my texts, drawings etc. That partition is <em>not</em>
      going to be handled during the installation. After the backup is made, 
      it's the right time to install Windows 2000.

<p>
<item>You see, folks, whenever I (re)install a Windows NT product, I
      like to see it on a clean partition. It means, I remove i.e.
      delete the existing partition where NT "system" files were stored,
      in order to get free ('unused') space. Then I chose to make
      a new partition that will be formatted as NTFS type of file
      system. After that, I opt to install Win2000 onto the new
      partition.

<p>
<item>The procedure of Windows 2000 Setup will remove LILO from the
      MBR, so a couple of next re-bootings during the installation won't 
      show LILO prompt.

<p>
<item>When the Win2000 installation is finished, you may re-install your
      favorite applications and restore your data from the
      backup. You should then check if everything goes fine with your
      new and old Windoze stuff :-)

<p>
<item>So far - so good. Now you have to look after your Linux boot
      floppy diskette. If you can't find it, you are out of luck.
      Actually, I am not sure if all Linux systems might be now
      activated without boot diskette. Some Linux <em>gurus</em>
      suggest to boot Linux from the installation CD, but I don't
      know if it can help in case your system doesn't have 
      <em>bootable</em> CD-ROM drive, i.e. a modern motherboard's
      BIOS. Any comment here?

<p>
<item>Well, after you successfully boot your Linux, you should go to
      <tt>/etc/lilo.conf</tt> to check it once again. You should have
      there at least two options: Linux and NT. Case you don't see the
      option to boot your beloved Windoze, you have to add it. It
      was described in previous sections. Then you have to run
      <bf>/sbin/lilo</bf> in order to put LILO boot loader into the MBR.

<p>
<item>That's all. Next time you boot your computer, you'll get your
      LILO prompt. Using &lt;Tab&gt key you'll see your boot options.

<p>
<item>From my experience - all work great! Although I <em>removed</em>
      previous WinNT installation in order to make new Win2000
      installation and also <em>lost</em> (temporarily) LILO boot loader,
      at the end I got both of them, Win2000 and Linux, the same
      way as I did with WinNT and Linux!

</itemize>


<sect>How to install WINDOWS 2000 <em>besides</em> LINUX and WINDOWS 98

<p>
<em>Notice: When I say 'beside Linux and Windows 98', I mean of
Linux and Windows 98 that <bf>already</bf> work together, so they were
installed earlier, <bf>before</bf> we made a decision to add 
Windows 2000. One of the machines I use at work, has both Linux
and Win98. They both load from under LILO menu.
</em> 

<p>
Actually, it is not a  very big problem to install Windows 2000 on a
computer where another Windows is running. In my case, it is Windows 98
so I just put 2000's CD into the drive. After it recognized that an
'older' version of Windows was running on my machine, it offered me
either to upgrade it to 2000 or to install W2k as the 'clean'
installation. At first, I tried to upgrade my Windows 98 to W2k, in
order to get a very similar combination that I have at home (described
in previous chapter). But, some hardware and software compatibility 
issues were reported (I mean, some of my components wouldn't stay 
fully operational if I just did an upgrade).

<p>
When saw that, I considered to try the 'fresh' installation of W2k, 
<em>beside</em> Win98 and Linux. Happily, I recently installed another 
HD into the box, so I did not need to handle the first disk, where Win98 
and Linux were living. Actually, the main reason to add the second disk
was that the first one got almost full. If I wanted to install the third
operating system on the first disk, I'd have to clean it well. So, when 
W2k's Setup asked for the location to be installed, I told it to use 
the second disk, repartition it and format it as the NTFS file system 
(just to mention that my Win98 was FAT32 and Linux was ext2).

<p>
After an hour or so, W2k's installation was finished. During the setup
procedure, it re-started the system a couple of times. When it was
about to do that for the first time, I was curious if it would re-write
the MBR, where LILO resides (actually, in the previous chapter, I have
mentioned that W2k's installation was likely to re-write the MBR).
Interestingly, it did not do that this time, so I continued to see 
'LILO boot:' on the screen. But, a *new* thing has appeared after LILO: 
the Windows 2000 boot loader, that in turn offered not only to load W2k but 
a 'Windows' (ie. my old Win98) too.

<p>
Well, depending on which operating system I like to start, the procedure
might slightly differ, but it is easy. No problem at all. For example:

<p>
<itemize>

<item>If I like to load my Linux, then LILO boot is the "cross-road".
At this point, the 'linux' entry should either be chosen or set as
default in <tt>/etc/lilo.conf</tt>;

<item>If I like to load Windows, then the other entry under LILO
boot should either be chosen or set to be default. After it is done,
Windows 2000 boot loader should appear on the screen. On that point,
I have two choices: W2k and W98. The rest is easy, both Windozes
start from there happily. 

</itemize>


<sect>How to install WINDOWS NT/2000 and LINUX (RedHat 7.1) on a <em>laptop</em>

<p>
<sect1>If you want to have *both* NT and 2000, besides Linux

<p>
<em>Notice: Recently my bosses decided to get a couple of HP Omnibook
6000 portables, so I quickly rushed to play with new toys. It was a 
series with Pentium 3 at 1 GHz and 128 MB of RAM. There's also a hard 
disk of 30 GB, removable DVD and FDD drives, a secondary battery that 
goes to the removable drive bay (when it's empty) and NIC/modem combo 
card.</em> 

<p>
<itemize>

<item>Well, the notebooks have come with Windows 2000 Professional 
preinstalled and I thought it might be great to reformat the disk 
and start from scratch. I think I did it again with Partition Magic 
utility by Power Quest. Actually, I have *erased* all existing
partitions because I noticed a small one at the beginning of the
disk, that looked to me a bit strange (well, I learned later that
it was there for hibernation and/or diagnostics).

<p>
<item>After that, I tried to repeat a procedure that I have always 
been very fond of: to make a couple of FAT partitions (cca. 2037 MB)
where my NT and/or W2k would go. Don't ask me why I use that old
FAT format - it is just to be sure that any type of Windows setup
will recognize such a partition and, as well, to be sure that some 
file exchange (if needed) would be possible between various operating 
systems. Beside these FAT partitions (that start, of course, from 
the beginning of the disk), I have also made several FAT partitions
but, this time, starting from the *end* of the disk. Partition
Magic allowes a user to do that (<-- here the guys from Power
Quest should send me a couple of 0.01$ for this commercial of
their product :-)).

<p>
Well, you may ask me why somebody should make a free space somewhere
in between. The answer is: In order to allow Linux's <bf>/boot</bf>
partition to stay under well known 1024 cylinder limitation.
When it comes to 1024 cyl area (actually, when you enter 1025,
1026 ... etc), it doesn't matter what is happening there. It
means, there you may put your Linux <bf>/</bf> (root) partition
(regardless of its size and structure), as well as to use 
remaining space for Windows/Linux exchange zone (i.e. FAT).

<p>
<item>So far - so good. So, I put NT's installation disk and
followed the procedure (you should be aware to use a "retail" NT
installation disk, *not* the one that came with Omnibook 6000,
because it is supposed to "restore" an NT installation, accompanied
with a hibernation partition. Why such a partition seems not
to be suitable here, we'll see later.

<p>
<item>After Windows NT was installed completely, it was the right
time to insert Windows 2000 installation CD (once again, do not
use 2000's disks that have come with the computer). So, from
within NT running, I have installed 2000 onto the next partition 
(actually, only the first part of the installation process starts 
from under NT, but it is OK). When the process has finished, you
have two Windozes - on your first two partitions.

<p>
<item>Everything seems to be running OK, excepting the diagnostics.
It should be activated with F10 at system boot <bf>if</bf> "restore" 
CD's were used. BTW, NT's "restoration" finishes with even bigger 
partition (cca. 500 MB). And not only that: this partition seems to 
be a *primary* one. That means, you may end up with a shortage of 
primary partitions, in case you intend to install several operating 
systems. Anyway, I have decided that the diagnostics is not too much 
important to me, so there's no use of F10 at system boot anymore :-)

<p>
<item>Not to forget to say, the Windows 2000's boot loader should
offer *both* NT and 2000 boot options, if you have followed the
mentioned procedure (case you don't want to have *both* NT and W2k
on the system, you may skip to the next section).

<p>
<item>Well, that is the time when I usually look after a Linux
installation CD's. The first one (in case of two) should be inserted
into the DVD (or in a CD drive) and the system has to be re-booted.
As usual, after a second or two after switching the system on,
<tt>Escape</tt> should be pressed one or two times, in order to 
change the "boot" device order (of course, a CD/DVD should be 
chosen here).

<p>
<item>The rest of Linux installation is just as usual. Don't forget
to make a Linux boot floppy at the end of the process (you never
know when the boot floppy might be of help).

<p>
<item>Folks, in short, that was that. If everything goes fine, the
next system boot should take you into the Linux environment. Don't
be surprised when you don't see your beloved Windoze(s) boot
loader(s) anymore. You just have to look into the another great
Linux document, called <url url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LILO.html"name="LILO"> mini-HOWTO. There you'll find more detailed information
about how <bf/LILO/ (<bf/Li/nux <bf/Lo/ader) works. 

<p>
<item>If you find it easier, read some pages before and check how it
was accomplished in the chapter "HOW TO <em>UPGRADE</em> WINDOWS NT TO 
WINDOWS 2000" 

</itemize>

<p>
<sect1>If you want to have only Windows 2000 and Linux

<p>
<em>Notice: Well, all I have said in the previous section, resulted
in a "multiboot" (or, better to say, "3-boot") system. When I want 
to run Linux - I have to choose its option from within LILO menu. 
When I am about to run any kind of Windoze - I have to choose Windows 
(or DOS, or whatever else) from within LILO menu. Soon after, on the
screen appears Windows 2000 boot loader. Finally, from this point,
either NT or 2000 may be booted. Well, for a next task, I wanted to 
install Symantec's Norton System Works onto both Microsoft environments. 
I did it successfully, but it seems that I have later entered a command 
that resulted in changing something very important in the setup. In sum, 
I have become not able to run both flavors of Windows properly. Looks 
that it was the right time to re-install all the stuff again :-)
</em> 

<p>
<itemize>

<item>Folks, this time I decided to use one of those "restore" CD's,
that came with the notebook. I must admit that I liked to see, as
the background, a great blue logo "HP Invent", as well as "Manufactured 
by Hewlett Packard" in My Computer's Properties (<-- here the guys 
from HP should send me a couple of 0.01$ for this commercial :-))

<p>
<item>Using the "restore" CD's might help you to avoid the whole
long NT/2000's setup procedure(s), because they replicate or, if
you like to say, "clone" images from the CD's to the hard disk, and 
it is very fast. In addition, the hibernation/diagnostics partition 
is being made by default. Finally, a couple of HP utils and tools can 
only be "restored" from these CD's.

<p>
<item>So, after a 6-7 minutes, NT (or W2k) is in its place, ready to
work. Similarly to "retail" versions (mentioned in the previous
section), now it is the right time to boot the system with a Linux
installation CD.

<p>
<item>The rest of Linux installation is just as usual. Don't forget
to make a Linux boot floppy at the end of the process (you never
know when that boot floppy might be useful).

<p>
<item>Folks, that was that - in short. If everything is fine, the
next system boot should take you into the Linux environment. Don't
be surprised when you don't see your beloved Windoze(s) boot
loader(s) anymore. You just have to look into the another great
Linux document, called <url url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LILO.html"name="LILO"> mini-HOWTO. There you'll find more detailed information
about how <bf/LILO/ (<bf/Li/nux <bf/Lo/ader) works. 

<p>
<item>If you find it easier, read some pages before and see how it
was done in the chapter "HOW TO <em>UPGRADE</em> WINDOWS NT TO 
WINDOWS 2000" 

<p>
<item>You bet, the life would be much easier if there were not such
troubles, like a "tolerance" between Windows and Linux world. Maybe 
I have made an another mistake somewhere in the cyberspace, but, as
soon as I have finished with that Linux installation - RedHat 7.1 in 
particular (today is May 04, 2002 and I still have no newer and better
distros here. Any donation from the readership ...?), I recognized 
that F10 at the system boot, does not open the HP diagnostics anymore. 
Actually, regardless of pressing F10, my Omnibook 6000 goes directly 
to the graphical LILO screen. *Before* installing Linux, diagnostics 
was running here without any problem.

<p>
<item>FYI, after the first next boot into W2k, its Disk Management tool 
has recognized the following partitions on the disk:

<p>
<table loc="ht!">
<tabular ca="lcllllllll">
   | Size   |Format    |  Label         |  Type    |@
1  |  15 MB |  FAT     |  -             |  Primary |@
2  |7.30 GB |FAT32     | HPNOTEBOOK  C: |  Primary |@
3  |  52 MB |  -       |  -             |  Primary |@
4  |18.37 GB|  -       |  -             |  Logical |@
5  | 258 MB |  -       |  -             |  Logical |@
6  |1.96 GB |Free space|  -             |  -       |
</tabular>
</table>

<p>
<item>On the other hand, Partition Magic "sees" as follows:

<p>
<table loc="ht!">
<tabular ca="lcllllllll">
   | Size in MB|Format    |  Label        |  Type    |@
1  |  14.7     |  FAT     |  save to disk |  Primary |@
2  |7.471,4    |FAT32     | HPNOTEBOOK    |  Primary |@
3  |  51.7     | ext2     |  /boot        |  Primary |@
4  |21.077,9   |extended  | -             |  Primary |@
5  |18.811,4   |ext2      |  /            |  Logical |@
6  | 258,4     |swap      | -             |  Logical |@
7  |2.008,1    |free space| -             |  Logical |
</tabular>
</table>

<p>
<item>Some more explanations, related to the tables above:
It is obvious that diagnostics partition, accompanied with
"restored" Windows 2000, is rather small - cca. 15 MB (comparing 
to the partition, that is created with "restored" Windows NT, which 
goes up to cca. 500 MB). Regardless of that fact, it is a <bf>primary</bf> 
one. That means you should be aware of how many primary partitions 
you have in the system. I am not sure now, but that might be one of
the reasons for not having diagnostic tools available anymore, 
after completing all operating system installations.

<p>
Next, you may see that I have "shrinked" W2k's FAT32
partition to a smaller size (cca. 7.5 gig), in order to
release enough free space for Linux.

<p>
I would suggest you to let Linux setup procedure to transform the 
free space into Linux partitions. I mean, there's no need to prepare
the Linux partitions manually. As you can see from the tables, 
it took cca. 50 megs for the boot part, cca. twice a physical RAM 
(2 x 128 = 256 megs) for swap and the rest goes for other Linux parts.
Remaining free space was probably left after the conversions
of various file format systems.

<p>
<item>What is the result now: Linux works, Windows works too. 
There's no diagnostics anymore. The hibernation (from under 
Windows) is not tested yet. At the first sight, the 3Com 
NIC/modem combo is not fully supported under Linux. Actually, 
NIC seems to work, but the modem part is a "winmodem". Nobody 
knows if HP would do something to solve that issue. All I could 
say is to avoid HP Omnibook 6000 if modem activities are your 
primary tasks. Of course, you may spend some $$$ and buy 
another PCI mini-card with supported modem chip. Beside that, HP's 
15" screen gives you great picture with the resolution of up to 
1400 x 1050 at 16 bit colors. Interestingly, that resolution seems
to be <em>default</em> under Windows 2000 and it is also easily 
adopted under Linux (RedHat 7.1). There is also somewhat "over-sensible" 
touchpad that often acts as the left mouse click. It seems to be a 
common feature for both Windows and Linux installations. It bothers 
me sometimes, but your mileage may vary.

<p>
<item>The plan is to convert the FAT32 partition to the NTFS in order 
to get more reliable Windows subsystem. On the other side, Linux 
main (root) partition should be "shrinked" in order to get some 
free space. That free space will be used later for exchanging files 
between these two operating systems (probably it will be also FAT).

<sect>How to install Mandrake Linux 9.1 on HP products

<p>
2003-11-19
<p>
<sect1>Description of the products used in this experiment
<p>
<em>Notice: Folks, that part of the article is <bf>NOT</bf> a commercial 
for HP production of any means! In fact, a series of their machines I use has lots
of failures in the power supply units, as well as with their hard disks. On
the other side, laptop's batteries get exhausted earlier than expected.
Other than these issues, HP machines are fine.</em>

<p>
<bf>HP Omnibook 6000</bf>

A laptop computer Omnibook 6000 is equipped with a bootable DVD 
drive. On the other hand I have supplied a bootable DVD-ROM 
with Mandrake Linux 9.1 installation. After booting the laptop with 
that bootable DVD, it gets directly to the installation menu,
asking the user to choose a language to use for the rest of the
installation.

<p>
<bf>HP Vectra VL420 (used as a server)</bf>

In opposite, an HP Vectra VL420 doesn't have a DVD drive (it only
has a CD drive), so the direct installation from that particular
installation DVD is not possible. But, an option of making
a bootable floppy disk for starting the installation procedure 
<em>is</em> possible. In fact, several boot images are available 
for those users who don't have (bootable or not) DVD drive. One 
of the images is a 'network' one. That means, in a local area network 
there has to be either a NFS, FTP or HTTP server from which the 
installation will take place.

<p>
<bf>HP Vectra VL420 (used as a workstation)</bf>

Another VL420 desktop system I also use, has a spare HDD from a 
previous Windows 2000 server installation (actually, that IDE disk was moved 
from the other computer where it was a primary one and here it is the second
one disk for backup data). The nice things is that it has a HTTP and FTP 
servers installed (of course, usable if the system is boot from that disk). 
That was good so I could use one of these servers now. On the other hand,
that particular Vectra VL420 was used to install a workstation kind of Linux
(that time, using its first hard disk - having Windows 2000 Professional).

<p>
<sect1>Installation procedure

<p>
<bf>System boot of the laptop</bf>
<p>
As explained earlier, the laptop has a bootable DVD drive, so that's it.
<p>
<bf>System boot of desktop machines</bf>
<p>
So, I made a 'network' bootable floppy and booted the first Vectra 
VL420 (intended to be a Linux server) with it. After a while, it 
came to a point to choose the installation method (NFS or FTP or 
HTTP server). At first, I wanted to use the second 'spare' HTTP 
server on the other Vectra, but regardless of what permission I tried 
to give to the 'Everyone' group of Windows users, I always got the 
following answer from the Linux setup:

Error: Couldn't get file ... (or something like that)

Then I tried to use the 'spare' FTP server from the second Vectra and, at
first, it also asked for local and remote IP addresses. That time successfully, 
it started to load a part of the remote Linux files into its memory without
any complaint. Soon after, it came to the very same position as Omnibook 
6000 did: it got directly to the installation menu, asking a user to choose 
a language for the installation use.

>From that point, the setup process was almost the same...

I have chosen/confirmed the following items:

- a language to use, besides English(American) as default: I added 
Unicode and Serbian (both Cyrillic and Latin);
- a mouse and keyboard;
- a security level - I accepted defaults: 'Standard' for laptop and 'Higher'
for server;

The next important task was to choose one of <em>DrakX</em> 
partitioning options: 

- for laptop I chose the 'Use the free space on the Windows
partition', because the laptop has one IDE hard disk and I wanted 
it to use a part of it for Linux (besides existing Windows 2000 Prof.
already installed). Windows' Disk Management reported: 

<p>
<verb>
Disk 0	15 	MB	FAT	(HP Diagnostics or like)
	7.13	GB	FAT32	(C: "HPNOTEBOOK")
	20.80	GB	Free space
</verb>

The two partitions (FAT & FAT32) were made during the installation 
procedure, using HP's supplied installation CD's.

At the first moment, Linux setup complained that my Windows partition
"was too fragmented" and required me to reboot under Windows, run
the "defrag" utility, then restart the Mandrake Linux installation.
The defragmentation process have taken cca. 1.5 hour to be completed!
When restarted the setup, it wanted to use 7.13 GB Windows partition, 
instead of 20.80 GB. I chose to 'Use the free space'. Then it made partitions
for Linux: /dev/hda5 and /dev/hda7.

- for Vectra VL420 I used 'Custom disk partitioning' because there 
I had two SCSI disks, one of them running Windows 2000 Server
already installed, and the other one I wanted to use entirely for a
Linux server. BTW, I wasn't sure what the option 'Erase entire disk'
would do during its next step (erase a whole disk or a partition?), 
although it also may be the proper solution too. <em>DrakX</em> 
recognized the two SCSI disks as <bf>sda</bf> and <bf>sdb</bf> 
and I chose <bf>sdb</bf> to install Linux. The first step was to 'Clear 
all' and after that to 'Auto allocate' the space on that second disk. 
Finally, after a 'Done' it appeared to make /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdb6 
Linux partitions.

<bf>Package Group Selection</bf>
<p>
Per default, the Mandrake 9.1 setup offers the following to be
installed:

<p>
<verb>
- Office Workstation
- Internet Workstation
- KDE Workstation
- Gnome Workstation
</verb>

that is in sum: Total size 1010/5267 (at laptop) and 1066/5265 (at server).

- for laptop I added all that was available, <em>excepting</em> 6 'Server' 
items (1612/5267),
<p>
- for server I added all that was available, <em>including</em> 6 'Server' 
items (1708/5265).

Then I got an info, related to selecting following servers (?) on laptop:
<p>
cups, postfix, rwho, webmin

and on server box:
<p>
cups, openssh-server, postfix, proftpd, rwho, webmin, ypserv, bind and
nfs-utils.

Although I was confused about the 'servers' to be installed on a laptop,
I have accepted those things to be installed, considering them needed 
for the proper installation of other packages.

The installation started ...

Interestingly, although the installation on the laptop was performed
directly from its DVD drive, the package installation process was 
significantly faster on the server box. I suppose that was due the 
difference in performances between server's SCSI disk and laptop's 
IDE disk.

After that step was finished, and after entering a password for root, setup
asked to 'Enter a user' (an ordinary user). The difference between laptop
and server installation was that the latter offered some additional tasks
for the (ordinary) user:

<p>
<verb>
- access to compilation tools (ctools)
- access to rpm tools (rpm)
- access to X programs (xgrp)
- access to network tools (ntools)
- access to administrative files (adm)
- allow "su" (wheel)
</verb>

... and that should be the same for other (new added) users.

Then laptop suggested to 'set up computer to automatically log on one user'.
I didn't accept such a solution because I wanted each user to enter his/her 
password <em>every</em> time he/she is about to log on to the system.

On the other hand, server's setup skipped that particular step and asked 
where to install the bootloader. I have chosen to use 'First sector of drive (MBR)'.

Soon after, a 'Summary' screen appeared, so I could fine tune the installation.
I changed the following items:

<p>
<verb>
- timezone: Belgrade (both machines)
- Graphical Interface (reported as 'not configured' on the laptop? - I tried 
   with 'Flat Panel 1400 x 1050' because that resolution runs fine under 
   Windows), X server: Rage Mobility, XFree 4.3 and 16 million colors - 
   24 bits). On laptop, I chose XFree to start when I reboot. On server, it 
   offered 800 x 600 - due to a recognized monitor Samsung SyncMaster 
   510(M)s (CHA5807*) and card ATI Rage 128 and 16 bit - 65 thousand color.
- Sound card: laptop is ESS Technology|ES1983S Maestro-3i|PCI Audio and
   server is Intel Corporation|ICH2 810 Chipset AC'97 Audio Controller.
- Network: with 'Use auto detection'. Results: on laptop it recognized 'LAN
   connection - ethernet card(s) detected'; on server it recognized
   nothing. So, on server I chose to configure 'LAN connection'.
   Drivers are: 3c59x (laptop), eepro100 (server).
   IP addresses for both laptop and server.
   Host name: laptop, server, Gateway:
- Firewall: disabled (def.)
- Botloader: lilo-graphic on /dev/hda (laptop)
   lilo-graphic on /dev/sda (server)
   default boot: windows on /dev/hda2 (laptop)
   windows on /dev/sda1 (server)
- Services: 32 activated for 47 registered (laptop)
   24 activated for 60 registered (server)
</verb>

Soon after ...

<tt>Congratulations, installation is complete.</tt>

(reboot)

<p>
<bf>Installation results</bf>
<p>
The next Windows boot made a screen 'System Settings Change': Windows 
2000 has finished installing new devices. You must restart your computer
before the new settings will take effect. Do you want to restart
your computer now? Well, I said <Yes>

Windows' Disk Management has showed new Linux partitions:

<p>
<verb>
- laptop: 	5.85 GB		Healthy	\
Disk 0		495 MB		Healthy	- all 3 are logical drives within the extended one
27.95 GB	14.46 GB	Healthy	/

- server:	5.85 GB		Healthy	- primary partition
Disk 1		494 MB		Healthy	\
17.12 GB	10.79 GB	Healthy	- these 2 are logical drives within the extended one
</verb>

It seems that <tt>/boot</tt> and <tt>/swap</tt> partitions are very similar in size, 
regardless the disk sizes, but <tt>/</tt> (root, home etc) partitions depend on 
disk size. Note that at my 'laptop' box I used the same HD of 27.95 GB for both 
Windows and Linux (for Windows 7.13 GB FAT32 of 27.95 GB available, the rest, 
cca. 20 GB for Linux). 

At the 'server' box I have two HD's of 17.12 GB each, and I used Disk 0 (the 1st 
one) entirely for Windows 2000 Server, and Disk 1 (the 2nd one) entirely for Linux. 

The first Mandrake Linux boot screen:

- laptop: a screen with only a name of a user (no root available!),
	Reboot and Halt buttons.

- server: a screen with 'Enter Login', 'Enter Password' and 'Session type' (no
	name of a user appeared).

First Time Wizard: Default KDE (both)

...

What about the Ctrl-Alt-Del action:

- laptop: a screen 'End Session for "username"' What do you want to do next?
	Login as different user, Turn off computer, Restart computer, OK and Cancel
	buttons.

- server: a screen 'End Session for "username"', Logout and Cancel buttons.

After choosing Login as different user (at laptop), or Logout (at server), what
appeared were the same screens as described in 'The first Mandrake Linux boot 
screen' section.

<p>
<bf>HP Vectra VL420 (workstation - desktop client)</bf>

As mentioned before, HP Vectra VL420 doesn't have a DVD drive (it 
only has a CD drive), so the installation from that particular
DVD installation was not possible. But, an option of making
a bootable floppy disk for it was possible. In fact, several
boot images are available for those users who don't have
(bootable or not) DVD drive. One of the images was a 'network'
one. That means, in a local network there should be a NFS, FTP
or HTTP server from which the installation will take place.
As earlier explained, a Windows 2000 server machine (that I 
earlier used for Mandrake Linux server installation), has HTTP 
and FTP servers installed. That was good so I could use 
one of them now.

So, I used the 'network' bootable floppy and booted Vectra VL420 
with it. After a while, it came to a point to choose the installation 
method (NFS or FTP or HTTP server). At first I wanted to use my 
HTTP server but regardless of what permission I gave to 'Everyone' 
I always got the answer from Linux installation program: 
Error: Couldn't get file ...

Then I tried to use my FTP server (on the same Windows server)
and it also asked for IP local and remote addresses. Then it
started to load a part of the remote files into its memory.
Soon after, it came to the very same position as Omnibook 6000 
did: it gets directly to the installation menu,
asking for choosing a language to use.

>From that point, the installation procedure was almost the same...

I have chosen/confirmed the following items:

<p>
<verb>
- a language to use - besides English(American) I also added
Unicode and Serbian, both Cyrillic and Latin;
- a mouse and keyboard;
- a security level - default 'Standard';
</verb>

The next important point was to choose one of DrakX partitioning
options: 

- At first I used the 'Use the free space on the Windows
partition' because it has one IDE hard disk and I wanted it to
use a part of it for Linux (besides existing Windows 2000 Prof.
already installed). 

At the first moment, Linux setup complained that my Windows partition
"was too fragmented" and asked me to reboot under Windows, run
the "defrag" utility, then restart the Mandrake Linux installation.
After defragmentation process was finished, I tried once again the
'Use the free space on the Windows partition' but it wanted just
to 'shrink' Windows partition from cca. 30 gig to cca. 28 gig. Then
I used Partition Magic software and tried to shrink it to cca. 20 GB
in order to get more free space for Linux.

Than I tried 'Custom disk partitioning', chose the first IDE disk
(hda) of 27GB, chose action 'Resize'. That one option was not good
because it just offered Windows partition to get larger instead of
smaller than before. Finally I used 'Use the free space' and it
automatically made Linux partitions. In fact, on that one Vectra I 
have two IDE disks, one of them having Windows 2000 Server
already installed, and the other one having Windows 2000 Prof. that
I wanted to use partly for Linux. After 'Done' it came to making 
/dev/hda5 and /dev/hda7.

<bf>Package Group Selection</bf>

Per default, Mandrake installation offers the following:

<p>
<verb>
- Office Workstation
- Internet Workstation
- KDE Workstation
- Gnome Workstation
</verb>

in sum, Total size 1009/5105 (client).

- for client I added everything else (1638/5105), excepting 6 'Server' items.

Then I got an info, related to selecting following server(s) on client:
<p>
cups, postfix, rwho, webmin

I have accepted those things to be installed.

The installation started ...

After that step was finished, and after entering password for root, setup
asked to 'Enter a user' (an ordinary user). The difference between client
and server installation was that the latter offered some additional tasks
for the user:

<p>
<verb>
- access to compilation tools (ctools)
- access to rpm tools (rpm)
- access to X programs (xgrp)
- access to network tools (ntools)

... and that would be the same for other (new added) users.

Then client suggested to 'set up computer to automatically log on one user'.
I didn't accept that because I wanted each user to enter his/her password
every time he/she is about to login to the system.

Soon after, a 'Summary' screen appeared, so I could tune the installation.
I changed the following items:

<p>
<verb>
- timezone: Belgrade
- Graphical Interface: it offered 1280 x 1024 - due to a 'custom' monitor
   and card NVIDIA GeForce2 DDR (generic) - 24 bit 16 million colors.
- Sound card: Intel Corporation|ICH2 810 Chipset AC'97 Audio Controller.
- Network: with 'Use auto detection'. Results: recognized nothing. So, I 
   chose to configure 'LAN connection'.
   Driver is: eepro100.
   IP address
   Host name: client, Gateway:
- Firewall: disabled (def.)
- Botloader: lilo-graphic on /dev/hda
   default boot: windows on /dev/hda1
- Services: 32 activated for 47 registered (the same as laptop)
</verb>

Soon after ...

<tt>Congratulations, installation is complete.</tt>

(reboot)

<p>
<bf>Installation results (all 3 systems)</bf>
<p>
<verb>
- laptop options: windows, linux, failsafe, floppy;
- client options: windows, linux, linux-nonfb, failsafe, windows2, floppy
- server options: windows, linux, linux-nonfb, linux-secure, failsafe
</verb>

Notes: 

<p>
- 'windows2' option at the client box is, in fact, Windows 2000
Server installation located on the second HD. 
<p>
- Not sure why 'laptop' doesn't have 'linux-nonfb' <em>text</em> boot option, 
although it looks like it boots to Linux in just like that mode (maybe it is a matter 
of the laptop's LCD screen capabilities or something like that). On the other hand, 
client and server differ in floppy and linux-secure options (perhaps as some 
security measures or like).
<p>
- 'linux-secure' option at the server box may be a result of a 'Higher' security
level, that I have chosen at the beginning of the installation or, maybe, there are
some special server security features.

The next Windows boot made a screen 'System Settings Change': Windows 2000
has finished installing new devices. You must restart your computer
before the new settings will take effect. Do you want to restart
your computer now? Well, I said Yes.

Windows Disk Management has showed new Linux partitions 
(comparison of 3 systems):

<p>
<verb>
- laptop: 	5.85 GB		Healthy	\
Disk 0		495 MB		Healthy	- all 3 are logical drives within the extended one
27.95 GB	14.46 GB	Healthy	/

- client: 	5.68 GB		Healthy	\
Disk 0		494 MB		Healthy	- all 3 are logical drives within the extended one
37.28 GB	3.52GB		Healthy	/ (same as laptop)

- server:	5.85 GB		Healthy	- primary partition
Disk 1		494 MB		Healthy	\
17.12 GB	10.79 GB	Healthy	- these two are logical drives within extended
</verb>

It seems that <tt>/boot</tt> and <tt>/swap</tt> partitions are very similar in size, 
regardless the disk sizes, but <tt>/</tt> (root, home etc) partitions depend on disk 
size. Note that at my 'client' box I used the same HD of 37.28 GB for both 
Windows and Linux (for Windows 27.60 GB NTFS of 37.28 GB available, the rest, 
cca. 10 GB for Linux). 

At the 'server' box I have two HD's of 17.12 GB each, and I used Disk 0 (the 1st 
one) entirely for Windows 2000 Server, and Disk 1 (the 2nd one) entirely for Linux. 
That's why Mandrake setup allocated 'less' space for / at the larger disk (in fact, 
at the 'server' box, it allocated relatively much more space for / even that HD 
is smaller - because that HD is 'dedicated' for Linux only.

The first Mandrake Linux boot screen:

- laptop: a screen with only a name of a user (no root available!),
	Reboot and Halt buttons.

- client: a screen with only a name of a user (no root available!),
	Reboot and Halt buttons.

- server: a screen with 'Enter Login', 'Enter Password' and 'Session type' (no
	name of a user appeared, but root may also login there!).

First Time Wizard: Default KDE (client, just like the others)

There is a difference between KDE screens at client and server: the client  
VL420 offers 'CD-ROM mounted at /mnt/cdrom' and 'Floppy mounted at 
/mnt/floppy' but server Vectra VL420 (having the same type of devices!) doesn't.
Besides that, if a flash storage is connected to a USB port, <em>before</em>
Linux being started, there will also appear an icon for it. Interestingly, at server 
there's no something like that. I consider, that is also a matter of the difference 
between the client and server types of Mandrake Linux installations, or maybe a
matter of some security measures for server-type installations. Whatever it is,
I see that as a shortage of confortable for Mandrake Linux servers. Case some
of you, the readers, has some workarounds on that issues, your contributions
are welcomed!

Besides that, KDE's Panel at client offers 'Mandrake Control Center - System 
configuration tool' (although useful only under root privileges), and KDE's Panel 
at server doesn't have that (in fact, an 'ordinary' user may access the same tool 
from the Start Applications menu and, again, to use it after the root's password 
entered). It makes me wonder why they at Mandrake did it like that. Maybe they
didn't want 'ordinary' users to access some configuration tools as easily ...

...

What about the Ctrl-Alt-Del:

- laptop: a screen 'End Session for "username"' What do you want to do next?
	Login as different user, Turn off computer, Restart computer, OK and
              Cancel buttons.

- client: a screen 'End Session for "username"' What do you want to do next?
	Login as different user, Turn off computer, Restart computer, OK and
              Cancel buttons.

- server: a screen 'End Session for "username"', Logout and Cancel buttons.

After choosing Login as different user what appeared were the same screen as 
described in 'The first Mandrake Linux boot screen' section.

Should you want to learn more about LILO (<bf/Li/nux <bf/Lo/ader), configured to
boot the systems in the examples above, you should refer to the
<url url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LILO.html" name="LILO"> mini-HOWTO.

There is also a difference between client and server behavior when it is about
to shutdown (halt) the system. A user is capable to halt the system even from
the login screen at client (that is not available at server). On the other hand,
a user has to know root password to halt the system at server.

<sect1>General issues with the Mandrake 9.1 Linux installation

<p>
A 'Network' bootable installation floppy should also be capable to reach
Mandrake installation files not only from NFS, FTP or HTTP servers, but
files that are copied to shared disks on machines within the local network. 
When an image is called a 'Network' image, that means, IMHO, all kinds of 
network locations should be accessible - NOT only those specific server-type 
locations like NFS, FTP or HTTP servers. In fact, if a user in a local
network doesn't have NFS, FTP or HTTP servers, but has the installation
packages copied somewhere else on the LAN, there should be a way to 
access those packages too.

The workstation-like installations do not offer a 'root' account to be used from
the graphical login window (I suppose that 'su' or 'sudo' actions are available 
- I haven't tested them yet). That might be a problem in cases when a user
misconfigures his/her account and when the administrator has to login to the 
system to fix that problem. At the moment, I am not sure how the administrator 
could do that without having the 'root' login ability (perhaps using virtual text 
consoles accessed with CTRL-ALT-F1, CTRL-ALT-F2 ... , then starting GUI 
if needed, etc ...)

<p>
<bf>Some issues <em>after</em> the Mandrake 9.1 Linux installation:</bf>

<p>
Talking about the behavior of Mandrake 9.1 - related to the type of installation 
(a workstation or a workstation/server combination) - it seems that there are 
some other differences. As already mentioned, on a workstation desktop there 
are icons for CD and FD drives (although maybe not already being 
<em>mounted</em> at the moment of the system boot). As well, if a USB flash 
storage is connected to the USB port, there is also an icon of an <em>sda</em>
(SCSI ?) USB storage available. On the other hand, in case of workstation/server 
installations - there are no icons of those devices at all. It seems that the server 
installation considers that is better to live without these devices in case of a 
server :-)  Any comments are welcomed.

<p>
Related to writing and testing HOWTO's. I prefer to write a 'HOWTO' document
using a text editor and make it with a <tt>.sgml</tt> extension. Then I use the old,
good <tt>sgml2html</tt> tool to make HTML pages, in order to check how these
pages will look like. Well, that's OK under Red Hat 7.1 but under Mandrake 9.1 it
seems that I am not able to find the same tool. Any idea on that task?


<p>
<sect>Linux accompanied with Windows 2000 and Windows XP

<p>
2005-10-09

<em>Recently I had a hard-disk failure and my more_than_a_year old
Linux/Windows 2000 home system disappeared. When considering what to
have on a new purchased disk, I decided to try Linux with both Windows
2000 and Windows XP.</em>

<p>
In short, the new disk was of 40 GB and I made a half of it (20 GB)
a NTFS partition for Windows XP. It became so called C: disk. The
second partition of 10 GB (FAT32) became D: disk of Windows 2000. As
usual, you have to repeat installations of Microsoft products for
several times - before they even start behaving partly as you expect
from them. To be more precize, it looked that Windows 2000 had to be
installed <em>before</em> Windows XP, in order its boot entry got
a part of XP's list of boot entries (If I remember, I tried it the
opposite way and it didn't work).

<p>
Then I used the remaining 10 GB to install Mandrake 9.1 (Bamboo) and
I made it without problems - The only minor issue was that a try of
disk-type installation where Linux files were placed on an existing
NTFS partition failed because Linux setup actually did not manage to
locate installation files on a NTFS partition. (That was why I made
Windows 2000 installation on a FAT32 file system - because later I
could use it for Mandrake 9.1 disk-type setup).

<p>
So far - so good. One of the main things I wanted to make working
within all three environments was the e-mail client. You bet, an another
open source solution was available: the Mozilla suite. For Windows
operating systems I used Mozilla 1.7.11 and for Linux I used Mozilla
1.6 (an older xft version - some newer ones I was not able to install).
And, as usual for me, I wanted all of them to share my mailbox files,
i.e. I wanted to access my incoming emails from all and each operating
system - booted at the time.

<p>
In order to make that possible, I chose Mozilla under Windows 2000
(FAT32) to become the 'central location' for saving the mailbox files.
That means I had to make some changes within other two Mozilla's
configurations - to make them capable to read/write from/to the first
chosen mailbox location (FAT32). For Linux I did the following:

<p>
Instead of keeping an 'original' Linux-native location:
<verb>
/home/misko/.mozilla/default/fydeba98.slt/Mail/solair.eunet.yu
</verb>
I changed to this mounted one:
<verb>
/mnt/win_d/Documents and Settings/misko/Application Data/Mozilla/Profiles/default/oeu1tmbd.slt/Mail/solair.eunet.yu
</verb>

<p>
As a result of that change, now it is possible for me to download
email messages from within one O.S. - then to read them from another
O.S. - and finally reply/send the email from the 3rd one environment.
The only minor drawback is that each operating system is likely to
'remember' only its own last known state of Mozilla's Mail & Newsgroups.
In order to get a 'refreshed' state of e-mail folders, a user has to
click on a mailbox name. Another solution is to activate an option of
'Compact all folders ...'.

<p>
What belongs to my 'wish-list' now, is to continue upgrading all
three Mozilla's (at least that old one v1.6 that runs under Mandrake).
It makes me wonder if I could use a 'regular' one (instead of xft's)
- although I remember that older regular's were producing awful fonts
under Linux environment. I am not sure if things got improved.

<p>
The second important task is to install one of the most popular radio
amateur software, also an open-source, called LinFBB (FBB for Linux).
More details related to that you can find in another Linux manual: the
<url url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/FBB.html"

Besides these articles published and papers presented, I have been
studying for an M.Sc. degree in computing. I am also the member of
the following associations: IEEE Computer Society, IEEE Communications
Society and ACM. In addition, I have been voluntarily working on establishing 
an academy computer network that would use the amateur radio 
stations as the media. Such networks exist somewhere else on the globe and 
I invite their administrators to contact me in order to cooperate.

<sect1>News

<p>
This is not the first release of this mini-HOWTO. I
hope to improve it whenever possible. Besides that, 
there are other documents that may help you to
install more than one operating system on the same computer.
You may look for them at the same location where you get
Linux+WindowsNT mini-HOWTO.

<em>This mini-HOWTO would be improved from time 
to time. If you think that the HOWTO on your 
Linux installation CD is some out-of-date, you
may check for newest release on the Internet. It 
could be found within the main <url url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/" name="Linux Documentation Project"> 
homepage or this one: <url url="http://www.tldp.org/"
name="Linux Documentation Project">.</em>

<sect1>HOWTO
<p>
<nidx>disk!information resources!HOWTOs</nidx>
These are intended as the primary starting points to
get the background information as well as show you how to solve
a specific problem.
Some relevant HOWTOs are <tt/Bootdisk/, <tt/Installation/,  <tt/SCSI/ and <tt/UMSDOS/.
The main site for these is the
<url url="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/"
    name="LDP archive">
at Metalab (formerly known as Sunsite).

<sect1>Mini-HOWTO
<p>
<nidx>disk!information resources!mini-HOWTOs</nidx>
These are the smaller free text relatives to the HOWTOs.
Some relevant mini-HOWTOs are
<tt/Backup-With-MSDOS/, <tt/Diskless/, <tt/LILO/, <tt/Large Disk/,
<tt/Linux+DOS+Win95+OS2/, <tt/Linux+OS2+DOS/, <tt/Linux+Win95/,
<tt/Linux+WindowsNT/, <tt/Linux+NT-Loader/, <tt/NFS-Root/, 
<tt/Win95+Win+Linux/, <tt/ZIP Drive/, <tt/FBB packet-radio BBS/.
You can find these at the same place as the HOWTOs, usually in a sub directory
called <tt/mini/. Note that these are scheduled to be converted into SGML and
become proper HOWTOs in the near future.

<sect1>Local Resources
<p>
<nidx>disk!information resources!local</nidx>
In most distributions of Linux there is a document directory installed,
have a look in the
<htmlurl url="file:///usr/doc"
    name="/usr/doc"> directory.
where most packages store their main documentation and README files etc.
Also you will here find the HOWTO archive (
<htmlurl url="file:///usr/doc/HOWTO"
    name="/usr/doc/HOWTO">)
of ready formatted HOWTOs
and also the mini-HOWTO archive (
<url url="file:///usr/doc/HOWTO/mini"
    name="/usr/doc/HOWTO/mini">)
of plain text documents.

Many of the configuration files mentioned earlier can be found in the
<htmlurl url="file:///etc"
    name="/etc">
directory. In particular you will want to work with the
<htmlurl url="file:///etc/fstab"
    name="/etc/fstab">
file that sets up the mounting of partitions
and possibly also
<htmlurl url="file:///etc/mdtab"
    name="/etc/mdtab">
file that is used for the <tt/md/ system to set up RAID.

The kernel source in
<url url="file:///usr/src/linux"
    name="/usr/src/linux">
is, of course, the ultimate documentation. In other
words, <em>use the source, Luke</em>.
It should also be pointed out that the kernel comes not only with
source code which is even commented (well, partially at least)
but also an informative
<url url="file:///usr/src/linux/Documentation"
    name="documentation directory">.
If you are about to ask any questions about the kernel you should
read this first, it will save you and many others a lot of time
and possibly embarrassment.

Also have a look in your system log file (
<htmlurl url="file:///var/log/messages"
    name="/var/log/messages">)
to see what is going on and in particular how the booting went if
too much scrolled off your screen. Using <tt>tail -f /var/log/messages</tt>
in a separate window or screen will give you a continuous update of what is
going on in your system.

You can also take advantage of the 
<htmlurl url="file:///proc"
    name="/proc">
file system that is a window into the inner workings of your system.
Use <tt/cat/ rather than <tt/more/ to view the files as they are 
reported as being zero length. Reports are that <tt/less/ works well here.

<sect1>Web Pages
<p>
<nidx>disk!information resources!WWW</nidx>
<nidx>disk!information resources!web pages</nidx>
There is a huge number of informative web pages out there and by their very
nature they change quickly so don't be too surprised if these links become
quickly outdated.

A good starting point is of course the
<url url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/" name="Linux Documentation Project"> 
home page, or this one: <url url="http://www.tldp.org/" name="Linux 
Documentation Project"> an information central for documentation, project 
pages and much, much more.

Please let me know if you have any other leads that can be of interest.


<sect>Getting help

<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!assistance, obtaining</nidx>

In the end you might find yourself unable to solve your problems and need
help from someone else. The most efficient way is either to ask someone
local or in your nearest Linux user group, search the web for the nearest
one.

Another possibility is to ask on Usenet News in one of the many, many
newsgroups available. The problem is that these have such a high
volume and noise (called low signal-to-noise ratio) that your question
can easily fall through unanswered.

No matter where you ask it is important to ask well or you will not be
taken seriously. Saying just <it/my disk does not work/ is not going
to help you and instead the noise level is increased even further and if
you are lucky someone will ask you to clarify.

Instead describe your problems in some detail that
will enable people to help you. The problem could lie somewhere you did
not expect. Therefore you are advised to list up the following information
on your system:

<descrip>
<tag/Hardware/
<itemize>
<item>Processor
<item>DMA
<item>IRQ
<item>Chip set (LX, BX etc)
<item>Bus (ISA, VESA, PCI etc)
<item>Expansion cards used (Disk controllers, video, IO etc)
</itemize>

<tag/Software/
<itemize>
<item>BIOS (On motherboard and possibly SCSI host adapters)
<item>LILO, if used
<item>Linux kernel version as well as possible modifications and patches
<item>Kernel parameters, if any
<item>Software that shows the error (with version number or date)
</itemize>

<tag/Peripherals/
<itemize>
<item>Type of disk drives with manufacturer name, version and type
<item>Other relevant peripherals connected to the same busses
</itemize>

</descrip>

Remember that booting text is logged to <tt>/var/log/messages</tt> which can
answer most of the questions above. Obviously if the drives fail you might not
be able to get  the log saved to disk but you can at least scroll back up the
screen using the <tt/SHIFT/ and <tt/PAGE UP/ keys. It may also be useful to
include part of this in your request for help but do not go overboard, keep
it <em/brief/ as a complete log file dumped to Usenet News is more than a
little annoying.
