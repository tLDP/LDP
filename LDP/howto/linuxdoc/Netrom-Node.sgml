This document describes how to setup the ax25-utilities package for
Amateur Radio such that it makes Netrom Nodes for the Node program
and the BBS software from John-Paul Roubelat, F6FBB. The DOS G8BPQ
Switch makes a bbs node and many features, it was expected that the
Linux ax25-utils would have a similar capability. This was not the
case. Help came from John Ackerman, N8UR who put a message on the
Linux-Ham SIG that he had done the BBS node and the info was on his
web site! When the information was tried it didn't work properly but
much was learned about the technique. Help from Tomi Manninen, OH2BNS
did the trick. Nodes for the BBS and the Node and the DX Cluster were
made and work fine.

<sect>Introduction
<p>
	It is possible, using just the ax25-util's to generate node
listings for the Node application and the FBB BBS and the DXNet DX
Cluster. This is done by changing the configuration files for Netrom
and making a Netrom entry for each application. At present there is a
kernel imposed limit of 4 Netrom entries. The new kernels are
expected to drop this limit.

	Now users look for CRUCES:K5DI-4 and LCBBS:K5DI-3 and
LCDX:K5DI-5 on the many nodes here in New Mexico, Texas and Arizona
and are connected like magic. They no longer need to remember
anything.


<sect>How to Begin
<p>
	Obtain and read the AX25-HOWTO:

<tt/ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/AX25-HOWTO/

	Using the AX25-HOWTO set up the normal Amateur Radio ax.25
and Netrom system and make certain it is operating properly.  When
the software "CALL" can be used to make either a ax25 or Netrom
connection to a distant node, the system is ready to change to one
using node listings like the BPQ Switch.
<sect>Some Details of the AX.25 Utilities
<p>
	Below is a list of all the applications and files that are
needed to set up a working ax.25 system. The Applications are all in
the /usr/sbin/ directory and the Configuration files are in the
/etc/ax25/ directory. Note: Kissattach is used only if you have TNC's
in the Kiss Mode.

<itemize>


<item> kissattach		Application
<item> call			Application
<item> ax25d  			Application
<item> ax25d.conf		Configuration file	
<item> axspawn			Application
<item> axspawn.conf		Configuration file
<item> axports			Configuration file

</itemize>

	There are several names that a ax25-util user must invent.
Since this paper uses the files of k5di, a listing of those names can
be made.

<tscreen><verb>

Name		Call-sign	Alias		Other	

ax0		k5di-9				ax25 9600 baud
ax1		k5di-10				ax25 1200 baud
Netrom		k5di-1		#CRUCE		Real Netrom 
netnod		k5di-4		CRUCES		Node node-list
netbbs		k5di-3		LCBBS		BBS  node-list
netdx		k5di-5		LCDX		DX-Cluster
</verb></tscreen>
	It's a good idea to make a list like this on paper before you
start to change things. It is easy to put the wrong name in a control
file. 

	Kissattach is an application that connects the kernel
to the TNC, sets the tcp/ip address up, sets the speed of the
connection, and is given the serial port to use.

	Axports is a file that defines the name of the ax.25 ports
and tells kissattach what call-sign, baud-rate and window size to use.
Below is an example of a 2 TNC system.

<tscreen><verb>
# /etc/ax25/axports
# Be very careful with the speed setting. This is the speed in
# bits/second that data passes from the computer to the TNC, and has
# nothing to do with the radio baud rate! 
#
# The format of this file is:
#
# name call-sign speed paclen window description
#
ax0 	K5DI-9		9600	255	3	445.1 (9600 bps)
ax1	K5DI-10		9600	255	1	145.07 (1200 bps)
</verb></tscreen>

	AX25D is the application that reads the ax25d.conf
Configuration file and answers calls made to the system. Below is a
sample ax25d.conf that has no Netrom defined. In fact all it will do
is answer calls to k5di-9 and k5di-10. When it answers it starts the
node application and logs the caller in.  

<tscreen><verb>
# /etc/ax25/ax25d.conf
#
#  AX25D Configuration File.
#
# AX.25 ports begin with a '['.
#
[k5di-4 VIA ax0]
default	 * *    *   *   *    0 - root	/usr/sbin/node	node 
[k5di-4 VIA ax1]
default	 * *    *   *   *     0 - root	/usr/sbin/node	node 
#
</verb></tscreen>
	The next step is to get ax25d to answer a call to the alias
CRUCES as well as the call-sign. This is easy to do and is shown
below:
<tscreen><verb>

# /etc/ax25/ax25d.conf
#
#  AX25D Configuration File.
#
# AX.25 ports begin with a '['.
#
[CRUCES VIA ax0]
default	 * *    *   *   *    0 - root	/usr/sbin/node	node
[k5di-4 VIA ax0]
default	 * *    *   *   *    0 - root	/usr/sbin/node	node 
[CRUCES VIA ax1]
default	 * *    *   *   *    0 - root	/usr/sbin/node	node
[k5di-4 VIA ax1]
default	 * *    *   *   *     0 - root	/usr/sbin/node	node 
#
</verb></tscreen>

	If you have trouble, as root kill ax25d if it is running and
then at the prompt type ax25d &. As ax25d loads the ax25d.conf file
it will print out any errors it finds. This print out is very accurate
and tells you which row in the file is wrong. 

	A connect from any adjacent node to k5di-4 or CRUCES will
connect to the k5di node. But Netrom is not transmitting a node
listing for CRUCES or k5di-4. This is done by changing some Netrom
Configuration files.


<sect>Setting Up Netrom
<p>
	Netrom has applications and files that control it's function
and to achieve the G8BPQ look and function we must use these in ways
never intended. Below is a list of these components of Netrom:

<itemize>
<item>nrattach        Application
<item>netromd         Application
<item>nrports		Configuration File
<item>nrbroadcast	Configuration File
</itemize>
	Nrattach is the application that works with the kernel and
establishes the ports and tcp-ip used by Netrom. To use nrattach you
place it in your startup file and the example looks like this:

<tscreen><verb>

/usr/sbin/nrattach -i 44.30.2.5 netrom
/usr/sbin/nrattach -i 44.30.2.5 netnod
</verb></tscreen>

Nrattach gets some of it's information from a configuration file
called nrports. This file is shown below:

<tscreen><verb>
# /etc/ax25/nrports
#
# The format of this file is:
#
# name call-sign alias paclen description
#
netrom          K5DI-1  #CRUCE   235    Switch
netnod          K5DI-4  CRUCES   235    Real Node
</verb></tscreen>

	There is no change to the nrbroadcast file so the remaining
changes will be made to the ax25d.conf file. In this file you
normally put the real netrom application called k5di-1, but since a
call to k5di-1 or #CRUCE gets undesirable results, leave that entry
out of ax25d.conf and a user will get just a "busy" when calling.

	Instead put in the netnod and that will allow ax25d to answer
a call to CRUCES. This is shown in the example below:

<tscreen><verb>
# /etc/ax25/ax25d.conf
#
#  AX25D Configuration File.
#
# AX.25 ports begin with a '['.
#
[CRUCES VIA ax0]
default	 * *    *   *   *    0 - root	/usr/sbin/node	node
[k5di-4 VIA ax0]
default	 * *    *   *   *    0 - root	/usr/sbin/node	node 
[CRUCES VIA ax1]
default	 * *    *   *   *    0 - root	/usr/sbin/node	node
[k5di-4 VIA ax1]
default	 * *    *   *   *     0 - root	/usr/sbin/node	node 
#
# NET/ROM ports begin with a '<'.
#
<netnod>
default 	* *     *   *   *   * -  root   /usr/sbin/node node
# 
</verb></tscreen>

	With these changes netrom node broadcasts will include the
node K5DI-4:CRUCES and K5DI-1:#CRUCE. By testing it was determined
that a call from any node to k5di-1 or #CRUCE got a busy, and a call
to k5di-4 or CRUCES connected to the node on this system.

<sect>Setting Up FBB and DXNet:
<p>

	The FBB packet BBS and DXNet Linux software are written to
answer calls to a call-sign defined in the configuration files. In
these examples the FBB call-sign is k5di-3 and the DXNet is k5di-5. 

	Since calls to k5di-3 and k5di-5 are answered by other
software, ax25d is not used and these calls should NEVER be found in
a ax25d.conf file. But the nrports file needs to have the information
added and 2 more nrattach lines are added to the start file. The
nrattach lines (4 each) and the file "nrports" are shown below:

<tscreen><verb>
/usr/sbin/nrattach -i 44.30.2.5 netrom
/usr/sbin/nrattach -i 44.30.2.5 netbbs
/usr/sbin/nrattach -i 44.30.2.5 netnod
/usr/sbin/nrattach -i 44.30.2.5 netdx

# /etc/ax25/nrports
#
# The format of this file is:
#
# name call-sign alias paclen description
#
netrom          K5DI-1  #CRUCE   235    Switch
netnod          K5DI-4  CRUCES   235    Real Node
netbbs		K5DI-3	LCBBS	 235	FBB BBS
netdx		K5DI-5	LCDX	 235	DXNet DX Cluster
</verb></tscreen>

	These changes will make the node listings wanted but a call
to LCBBS will not work yet. Recall that FBB answers a call to k5di-3
but not the alias. To achieve this a change to the
/usr/local/fbb/system/port.sys file is required. Before these changes
port.sys had a listing for the name "netrom". With these changes
replace "netrom" with "netbbs". That section of port.sys is shown
below:
<tscreen><verb>
#TNC NbCh Com MultCh Pacln Maxfr NbFwd MxBloc M/P-Fwd Mode  Freq
 0   0    0   0      0     0     0     0      00/01   ----  File-fwd.
 1   8    1   ax0    250   4     1     10     30/60   XUWY  UHF port
 2   2    1   ax1    250   4     1     10     00/60   XUWY  VHF port
 3   6    1 netbbs   250   4     4     10     30/60   XUWY  BPQ look
 4   8    2   0      250   5     4     1000    5/15   TUWY  Telnet
#
</verb></tscreen>

	A similar change is made to the "dxnet.cfg" file where netrom
is replaced with netdx. When these changes are made and a few hours
have passed to let Netrom send node lists, any nearby node will have
nodes listed to your Netrom for CRUCES and LCBBS and LCDX, and they
will all work just as they do when using the G8BPQ Switch under DOS.
