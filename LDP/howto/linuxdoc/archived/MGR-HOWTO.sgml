	While Vincent Broman first put together this HOWTO,
	much of the information and text was obtained from FAQs,
	READMEs, etc. written by Stephen Uhler, Michael Haardt,
	and other public-spirited net-persons.
	Email corrections and suggested changes to <tt>broman@nosc.mil</tt>.

	Uhler was the main architect of <bf>MGR</bf> -- see the Credit section below.

<sect>What is the MGR window system?
<p>
    <sect1>Function
<p>
	<bf>MGR</bf> (ManaGeR) is a graphical window system.
	The <bf>MGR</bf> server
	provides a builtin window manager and windowed graphics terminal
	emulation on color and monochrome bitmap displays.  <bf>MGR</bf> is
	controlled by mousing pop-up menus, by keyboard interaction, and by
	escape sequences written on pseudo-terminals by client software.
<p>
	<bf>MGR</bf> provides each client window with: termcap-style terminal
	control functions, graphics primitives such as line and circle
	drawing; facilities for manipulating bitmaps, fonts, icons, and
	pop-up menus; commands to reshape and position windows; and a
	message passing facility enabling client programs to rendezvous
	and exchange messages.  Client programs may ask to be informed
	when a change in the window system occurs, such as a reshaped
	window, a pushed mouse button, or a message sent from another
	client program.  These changes are called events.
	<bf>MGR</bf> notifies a
	client program of an event by sending it an ASCII character string
	in a format specified by the client program.  Existing
	applications can be integrated into the windowing environment
	without modification by having <bf>MGR</bf> imitate keystrokes in response
	to user defined menu selections or other events.

    <sect1>Requirements
<p>
	<bf>MGR</bf> currently runs on Linux, FreeBSD,
	Sun 3/4 workstations with SunOS, and
	Coherent.  Various older versions of <bf>MGR</bf> run on the Macintosh,
	Atari ST MiNT, Xenix, 386-Minix, DEC 3100, and the 3b1 Unix-pc.
	Many small, industrial, real-time systems under OS9 or Lynx in Europe
	use (another variant of) Mgr for their user interface.
	The programming interface is implemented in C and in ELisp,
	although supporting clients written in other languages is quite
	easy.

	Running <bf>MGR</bf> requires much less in resources than X, or even gcc.
	It does not have the user-base, software repertory, or high-level
	libraries of X or MS-Windows, say, but it is quite elegant
	and approachable.

	It has been said that <bf>MGR</bf> is to X as Unix was to Multics.

    <sect1>How do MGR, X11, and 8.5 compare?
<p>
        <bf>MGR</bf> consists of a server with builtin window manager and terminal
	emulator, and clients which run in this terminal emulator and use it
	to communicate with the server.  No resource multiplexing is done.

	X11 consists of a server and clients, which usually connect to the
	server using a socket.  All user visible things like terminal
	emulators, window managers etc are done using clients.  No resource
	multiplexing is done.

	8.5, the Plan 9 window system, is a resource multiplexer, as each
	process running in a window can access <tt>/dev/bitblt</tt>,
        <tt>/dev/mouse</tt> and
	<tt>/dev/kbd</tt> in its own namespace.  These are multiplexed to the
	<tt>/dev/bitblit</tt>, <tt>/dev/mouse</tt> and <tt>/dev/kbd</tt>
        in the namespace of 8.5.
	This approach allows one to run 8.5 in an 8.5 window,
	a very clean design.  8.5 further has an integrated window manager
	and terminal emulator.

<sect>Installing MGR
<p>
    The latest source distribution can be FTPed from the directory
    <tt>ftp://archimedes.nosc.mil/pub/Mgr/69</tt>
    or Mosaiced from <tt>http://archimedes.nosc.mil/Mgr/69</tt>.
    The same should be found at
    <tt>ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/MGR</tt> and its mirrors.
    Older versions of this distribution
    from Haardt can be found on <tt>tsx-11.mit.edu</tt> and perhaps elsewhere.
    Pre-Linux versions of <bf>MGR</bf> from Uhler and others have been found at
    <tt>ftp://bellcore.com/pub/mgr</tt>, but I think they are gone now.
    I have saved a copy of everything about <bf>MGR</bf> seen on the Internet,
    but I am not aware of anything weighty
    that is missing from this Linux/Sun distribution.
    <bf>MGR</bf> has been through a lot of versions and releases,
    but the current *Linux* version number is 0.69.  This version number
    could jump to 1.0 when stable 256-color VGA code for Linux appears
    (for more than one video card type).
    RCS version numbers have increased from Bellcore's 4.3 up to our 4.13 now.

    Required tools to build this distribution of <bf>MGR</bf> are m4 (GNU, or
    perhaps another supporting the -D option), make (GNU, or perhaps
    another supporting include) and *roff for the docs.  Also sh,
    awk, and POSIX install.  Binary distributions are not assembled often
    so you need an ANSI C compiler environment, e.g. gcc.

    A Linux installation requires Linux 0.99.10 or better
    (1.2.13 is what I actually test on now),
    an HGC, EGA, VGA, or SVGA graphics card, and a mouse.  Mouses supported
    are: serial Microsoft mouse, serial MouseSystems 3 and 5 byte
    mouse, serial MMSeries mouse, serial Logitech mouse, PS/2 mouse,
    or a bus mouse.
    With Buckey (Meta) hot keys enabled, even a mouseless system could
    do a certain amount of useful work under <bf>MGR</bf>.
    The VGA 640x480 monochrome graphics mode is
    supported out of the box, as is 640x350 and 640x200.  To run
    800x600, or other modes that your BIOS can initialize and which
    do not require bank-switching, you need to run a small program
    (supplied as <tt>src/vgamisc/regs.exe</tt>)
    under DOS or an emulator to read the VGA registers
    and write a header file which you place in the
    directory <tt>src/libbitblit/linux</tt>,
    so that it can be <tt>#include</tt>'d
    by the <tt>vga.c</tt> file there.
    Samples of these files are supplied, but please create your own.
    Some VGA cards can use 128k
    windows, and these might run higher monochrome resolutions.

    The Linux-colorport code also runs in the standard
    320x200x256 color VGA mode without difficulty, because no bank switching
    is required.  If you think of how few 64000 pixels is, you would
    realize this color mode is quite limited.
    Non-fast, but simple, bank-switching code has
    been added in version 0.65, and it works with a Tseng ET4000 card
    in 640x480x256 and 800x600x256 modes.  The S3 code does not
    work in super VGA resolutions, yet.  Supporting new super VGA cards
    requires writing one function to switch banks and then making sure that
    the desired screen mode can be initialized from a register dump,
    possibly with hand-tweaking.  The Linux color servers generally
    mangle the screen fonts, necessitating use of restorefont as in runx.
    If someone were to extract the VGA initialization code out of X,
    this might make MGR work on a lot more color systems.

    Suns with SunOS 4.1.2+ and <tt>bwtwo</tt>, <tt>cgthree</tt>, or
    <tt>cgsix</tt> frame buffers are supported.
    Their speed handling color is good.
    Coherent installations should refer to the
    <tt>Versions/README.Coh</tt> file in the source distribution.
    Porting the
    latest-and-greatest <bf>MGR</bf> to another POSIX-like system which
    provides <tt>select()</tt> and pty's and direct access to a bitmapped
    frame-buffer ought to be straightforward, just implementing the
    <tt>libbitblit</tt> library based on the <tt>sunmono</tt> or
    <tt>colorport</tt> code, say.
    
    If you want to install everything, you need 7 MB disk space for
    binaries, fonts, manual pages etc.  The sources are about 4.5 MB,
    plus object files during compilation.

    Normally, <tt>/usr/mgr</tt> should be either the directory or a link to the
    directory where you install <bf>MGR</bf> stuff for runtime use.  Typing
<tscreen><verb>
cd /usr/mgr; tar xvfz whereveryouputit/mgrusr-0.69.tgz
</verb></tscreen>
    and optionally
<tscreen><verb>
cd /usr/mgr; tar xvfz wherever/morefonts-0.69.tgz
</verb></tscreen>
    will unpack these.  The source can be put anywhere, e.g. typing
<tscreen><verb>
cd /usr/src/local/mgr; tar xvfz wherever/mgrsrc-0.69.tgz
</verb></tscreen>
    to unpack the sources from <tt>archimedes.nosc.mil</tt>.

    The source tree can be compiled from one top-level Makefile which
    invokes lower-level Makefiles, all of which &dquot;include&dquot;
    a <tt>&dquot;Configfile&dquot;</tt>
    at the top level.  The <tt>Configfile</tt> is created by an interactive sh
    script named <tt>Configure</tt>, which asks you questions,
    then runs m4 on a <tt>Configfile.m4</tt>.
    So you type something like this:

<tscreen><verb>
chdir /usr/src/local/mgr
sh ./Configure
make first
make depend
make install
make clean
</verb></tscreen>

    It might be wise, before running make, to eyeball the <tt>Configfile</tt>
    generated by the <tt>Configure</tt> script, checking that it looks reasonable.
    (At least one m4 poops out (Sun <tt>/usr/bin/m4</tt>),
    creating a very short <tt>Configfile</tt>.
    If this happens, try hand editing a copy of <tt>Configfile.sun</tt> or
    <tt>Configfile.lx</tt>)
    One can also <tt>make all</tt> in any directory with a Makefile
    as soon as the libraries have been compiled and installed.
    The server, libraries, and some clients have been linted, but several
    clients are K&amp;R C code that generates many compiler warnings.
<p>
    Several flags in MGRFLAGS can be added/omitted in the Configfile
    to change some
    optional features in the server, viz:
<descrip>
<tag/-DWHO/ muck utmp file so &dquot;who&dquot; works
<tag/-DVI/ code for clicking the mouse in vi moving the cursor
<tag/-DDEBUG/ enable debugging output selectable with -d options.
<tag/-DFASTMOUSE/ XOR the mouse track
<tag/-DBUCKEY/ for hot-key server commands without mousing
<tag/-DPRIORITY/ for priority window scheduling instead of 
			round-robin; the active window gets higher priority
<tag/-DCUT/ for cut/paste between windows and a global snarf buffer
<tag/-DMGR_ALIGN/ forces window alignment for fast scrolling (monochrome)
<tag/-DKILL/ kills windows upon tty i/o errors
<tag/-DSHRINK/ use only some of the screen (&dollar;MGRSIZE in environment)
<tag/-DNOSTACK/ don't permit event stacking 
<tag/-DBELL/ audibly ring the bell
<tag/-DKBD/ read <tt>mgr</tt> input from the sun kbd, instead of stdin.
			This permits redirection of console msgs to a window.
<tag/-DFRACCHAR/ fractional character movement for proportional fonts
<tag/-DXMENU/ extended menu stuff (experimental)
<tag/-DMOVIE/ movie making extension which logs all operations to a
			file for later replay -- not quite working under Linux
<tag/-DEMUMIDMSBUT/ Emulate a missing middle mouse button by chording
</descrip>
    Not all combinations of these options have been tested on all systems.

    The BITBLITFLAGS macro should contain <tt>-DBANKED</tt> if you're trying
    out the super VGA color.
<p>
    C code for the static variables in the server containing icons and fonts
    is generated by a translator from icon and font files.

    Not all the clients are compiled and installed by the Makefiles.
    Clients found under <tt>src/clients</tt> having capitalized names or
    not compiled by the supplied Makefiles may have problems compiling
    and/or running, but they may be interesting to hack on.
    Most of the screen drivers found under the <tt>libbitblit</tt> directory are
    of mainly archeological interest. Grave robbing can be profitable.
<p>
    At some point check that your <tt>/etc/termcap</tt> and/or
    <tt>terminfo</tt> file
    contain entries for <bf>MGR</bf> terminals such as found in the <tt>misc</tt>
    directory.  If all your software checks &dollar;TERMCAP in the environment,
    this is not needed, as long as you run <tt>eval `set_termcap`</tt>
    in each window.
<p>
    <bf>MGR</bf> works better if run setuid root, because it wants to chown
    ptys and write in the utmp file.  This helps the ify iconifier
    client work better and the event passing mechanism be more secure.
    On Linux, root permissions are <em>required</em> in order to do in/out on the
    screen device.  Otherwise, you decide whether to trust it.
<p>
    In versions around 0.62 there are troubles on the Sun with using
    the csh as the default shell.  Programs seem to run in a different
    process group than the foreground process group of the window's pty,
    in contradiction to man pages and posix specs.
    There is no trouble with bash, sh, or rc.  Ideas why?

<sect>Running MGR
<p>
    The only file <em>required</em> in an <bf>MGR</bf> installation is the server
    itself.  That would give you terminal emulator windows with shells
    running in them and cutting and pasting with the mouse,
    but no nice clocks, extra fonts, fancy graphics,
    etc.  Depending on options, a monochrome server needs about 200K of RAM
    plus dynamic space for windows, bitmaps, etc.
<p>
    If <tt>/usr/mgr/bin</tt> is in your PATH,
    then just type &dquot;<tt>mgr</tt>&dquot; to start up.
    After enjoying the animated startup screen, press any key.
    When the hatched background and mouse pointer appear, hold down
    the left mouse button, highlight the &dquot;new window&dquot; menu item, and
    release the button.  Then drag the mouse from corner to corner
    where you want a window to appear.  The window will have your
    default shell running in it.  Hold down the left mouse button over
    an existing window to see another menu for doing things to that
    window.  Left-clicking on an obscured window raises it to the top.
    The menu you saw that pops-up over the empty background
    includes the quit command.
    For people with a two button mouse:
    press both buttons together to emulate the missing middle button
    used by some clients.
<p>
    The quit submenu includes the &dquot;really quit&dquot; option,
    a suspend option which should only be used if you run a
    job-control shell, and a screen saver and locker option, which
    waits for you to type your login password when you come back
    to your machine.
<p>
    When trying to run <bf>MGR</bf>, if you get:
<descrip>
<tag/can't find the screen/
      make sure you have a <tt>/dev</tt> entry for your display device,
      e.g. on
      a Sun <tt>/dev/bwtwo0</tt>.  If not, as root cd to <tt>/dev</tt>, and type
      &dquot;MAKEDEV bwtwo0&dquot;.  Otherwise, you might need the
      <tt>-S/dev/bwtwo0</tt>
      or (on Linux) the <tt>-S640x480</tt> command line option when starting <tt>mgr</tt>.
      On Linux, you might also make sure that <tt>/usr/mgr/bin/mgr</tt> was
      installed setuid root.

<tag/can't find the mouse/
      make sure <tt>/dev/mouse</tt> exists, usually as a symbolic link to the
      real device name for your mouse.  If you haven't permission to
      write in <tt>/dev</tt>, then something like a <tt>-m/dev/cua0</tt>
      option can be
      given when starting <tt>mgr</tt>.  Also, make sure you've supplied the
      right mouse protocol choice when you configured <tt>mgr</tt>.  The mouse
      may speak Microsoft, even if that is not the brand name.

<tag/can't get a pty/
      make sure all of <tt>/dev/[tp]ty[pq]?</tt>
      are owned by root, mode 666,
      and all programs referenced with the &dquot;shell&dquot; option in 
      your <tt>.mgrc</tt> startup file (if any) exist and are executable.

<tag/none but the default font/
      make sure <bf>MGR</bf> is looking in the right
      place for its fonts.  Check the <tt>Configfile</tt> in the source or
      see whether a <tt>-f/usr/mgr/font</tt> option to <tt>mgr</tt> fixes the problem.

<tag/completely hung (not even the mouse track moves)/
      login to your machine from another terminal (or rlogin) and kill the
      <tt>mgr</tt> process.
      A buckey-Q key can quit <bf>MGR</bf> if the keyboard still works.
</descrip>

    <sect1>Applications not aware of MGR
<p>
	Any tty-oriented application can be run in an <bf>MGR</bf> window
	without further ado.  Screen-oriented applications using
	termcap or curses can get the correct number of lines and
	columns in the window by your using <tt>shape(1)</tt>
        to reshape the window or using
	<tt>set_termcap(1)</tt> to obtain the correct termcap entry.

<sect>Programming for MGR
<p>
    The <bf>MGR</bf> programmers manual, the C language applications interface,
    is found in the doc directory in troff/nroff form.  It covers
    general concepts, the function/macro calls controlling the server,
    a sample application, with an index and glossary.

    Porting client code used with older versions of <bf>MGR</bf> sometimes
    requires the substitution of
<tscreen><verb>
    #include <mgr/mgr.h>
</verb></tscreen>
    for
<tscreen><verb>
    #include <term.h>
    #include <dump.h>
</verb></tscreen>
    and clients using old-style B_XOR, B_CLEAR, et al instead of
    BIT_XOR, BIT_CLR, et al can be accommodated by writing
<tscreen><verb>
    #define OLDMGRBITOPS
    #include <mgr/mgr.h>
</verb></tscreen>

    Compiling client code generally requires compiler options like
    the following.
<tscreen><verb>
    -I/usr/mgr/include   -L/usr/mgr/lib -lmgr
</verb></tscreen>

    One can get some interactive feel for the <bf>MGR</bf> server functions by
    reading and experimenting with the <tt>mgr.el</tt> terminal driver for GNU
    Emacs which implements the <bf>MGR</bf> interface library in ELisp.

    The usual method of inquiring state from the server has the
    potential of stumbling on a race condition if the client also
    expects a large volume of event notifications.  The problem arises
    if an (asynchronous) event notification arrives when a
    (synchronous) inquiry response was expected.  If this arises in
    practice (unusual) then the <bf>MGR</bf> state inquiry functions would have
    to be integrated with your event handling loop.

    The only major drawing function missing from the <bf>MGR</bf> protocol, it
    seems, is an area fill for areas other than upright rectangles.
    There is new code for manipulating the global colormap, as well as
    (advisory) allocation and freeing of color indices owned by windows.

    If you are thinking of hacking on the server, you can find the mouse
    driver in <tt>mouse.*</tt> and <tt>mouse_get.*</tt>,
    the grotty parts of the keyboard
    interface in <tt>kbd.c</tt>, and the interface to the display in the
    <tt>src/libbitblit/*</tt> directories.  The main procedure, much
    initialization, and the top level input loop are in <tt>mgr.c</tt>, and the
    interpretation of escape sequences is in <tt>put_window.c</tt>.

<sect>More documentation
<p>
    The programmer's manual is essential for concepts.

    Nearly all the clients supplied come with a man page which is installed
    into <tt>/usr/mgr/man/man1</tt> or <tt>man6</tt>.
    Other useful man pages are <tt>bitblit.3</tt>, <tt>font.5</tt>, and
    <tt>bitmap.5</tt>.
    There is some ambiguity in the docs in distinguishing the
    internal bitmap format found in your frame-buffer and the external
    bitmap format found in files, e.g. icons.

    The <tt>mgr.1</tt> man page covers command line options, commands in
    the <tt>~/.mgrc</tt> startup file, mouse and menu interaction with the server,
    and hot-key shortcuts available on systems with such hot-keys.

    Many of the fonts in <tt>/usr/mgr/font/*</tt> are described to some
    extent in <tt>/usr/mgr/font/*.txt</tt>, e.g. <tt>/usr/mgr/font/FONTDIR.txt</tt>
    gives X-style font descriptions for the fonts obtained
    in .bdf format.  Font names end in <tt>WxH</tt>, where <tt/W/ and <tt/H/
    are the
    decimal width and height in pixels of each character box.

    All bitmap fonts from any source are strictly public domain in the
    USA.  The 583 fixed-width fonts supplied with <bf>MGR</bf> were obtained
    from Uhler, the X distribution, Yossi Gil, and elsewhere.
    The Hershey vector fonts and the code for rendering them
    are probably freely redistributable.
