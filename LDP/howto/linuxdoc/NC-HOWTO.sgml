This document tries to describe how to hook up a IBM Netstation  / 
Netvista
to your local network using a Linux box as
server. 



</abstract>
<toc>
<sect> Introduction


<sect1> What's this document

<p>
Some unused piece of delicious hardware floating around on my desk.
Screaming to be used. 40 MB of
ram and a 403 PPC inside. 
<p>
So I decided to give it a try and connect it to my local Linux network. 
<p>
In this Howto we'll be dealing with an 
This Howto started out with a 
IBM Network Station model
8361-100, other models were added afterwards
<p>
We also have some additional info about the other 2 models. The
8361-200 (Model 300)  and the 8362-A23 (Model 1000).  
More info can be found at <htmlurl
url="http://www.pc.ibm.com/networkstation/products/"
name="http://www.pc.ibm.com/networkstation/products/">(choose your region
here)
<p>

I'm trying to describe how I setup the NC, there are probably lots of
other ways to set up this machine, however this one works fine.
Any other remarks you might have from your own experience are welcome.
(Hardware is also welcome ;-))
<p>
This Howto is not trying to be the Bible on NC's and Linux, it's
trying to get you started.  Contributions to this NC are most welcome. 
<p>
During the past year I have received numerous comments on the HOWTO and lots
of help from other people (suprisingly a lot from inside IBM).   I've been 
busy,
therefore now is the first time that I'm trying to do a real update of the
HOWTO.  Most people are asking me about Linux binaries to extract the
AIX distribution file.  I have heard about an internal IBM project that is
 going on there but I have no accurate info on that matter yet.

</sect1>
<sect1>Todo
<p>
Things we still have to implement in this Howto
<itemize>	
<item>How to export your homedir
<item>How to run applications
<item>How to run Java Applets
</itemize>

Help is appreciated ;-)


<p>
Since version 1.91 this Howto wil also document the more recent units like the 
Netvista 2200 and the Netvista 2800.

<sect>The Netstation Family
<p>
As far as I know there are currently 3 differerent kinds of situations when talking about Linux and the Netstation
famlily.
The first type is the IBM NC 100, 110 and 300 series. (I`m still waiting on confirmation on 
the fact that the 110 series indeed do boot Linux ;))).  These babies 
don't run 
linux as far as I know.  This HOWTO however describes how to ingetrete it
into your Linux environment. <p>

The second type is the IBM NC 1000, as of november 2002 these do run Linux , although I haven't had the time to
document this clearly you can download the required software from 

<htmlurl
url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/networkstation/" name="http://sourceforge.net/projects/networkstation/">
<p>


All of the above types are PowerPC based devices.

<P>
The third type of Netstations are the 2200 and the 2800 series. These are Intel based devices and have been
designed to run Linux by default.  You will find some basic documentation on HOWTO install these machines in the
howto.




<p>

<sect>Requirements

<sect1>Hardware
<sect2>Netstation Clients
<p>

An NC, connected to your local Network, most likely by a UTP connection , thus
via a cross-cable or HUB connecting to an Server - in this case a Linux Box 
Basically the NC is Made to work with either AS/400 , Windows
NT or AIX Servers. These are all expensive solutions,  however working
with thin clients doesnt have to cost that much.  (Token Ring versions are 
also available) 

The model I have at my disposal is an IBM Network Station model 8361-100,
On the inside you can find an 403PPC chip, some S3 vga components, an
PCMCIA slot, and normal 72 pin (parity ??) simms.
I found 8+32 Mb in my edition.
<p>
Actually those 40Mb were major overkill.  In
full operation modes  with lot's of configuration 
panels a couple of telnet sessions and a X -query open only took up   
about 4Mb of ram.  )   So taking out the 32Mb showed absolutely no
significant loss of speed.  <p>

Well, after working more with the Netstation, specially with Navio I found
out Navio uses  as much 27-30 Mb.  So those 40 Mb`s really aren`t that
much hoverkill<p>


We proved it was no problem setting it up on a  
Linux only network.  You'll need a server that can provide you both with
about 25Mb of free diskspace for the software, and the capacities to run
an X -query.   In the setup overhere we used a 486DX50 with 8Mb as a
fileserver and I switch between another  486DX266 (PS/2 85) with 32Mb,  
and my Multia with 48Mb as the X server
Of course, the faster machines the better.

<sect2>Changes in the new versions.
<p>

The new version comes with a new kernel and some changes in the
applications.
The kernel  can now be downloaded as a compressed file which speeds up the
process.
<p>
Starting with the Network Station 3.0, you need a new Boot Monitor or boot
PROM
(aka Firmware) with the version 3.0.x or later. Your NetworkStation won't
work
with a older boot PROM (aka Firmware) and the new Network Station 3.x
kernel.
If you buy a new NetworkStation, you always get one of the latest PROMs Older
versions can be automatically updated from a boot server, from which the
new boot PROM get's downloaded. (Could somebody please confirm me that these devices are the 110 versions
with a PPC 403GC(X) in it !!!!)

<p>
There also is a new layout of the Setup Utility where you define you basic
network settings of your Network Station.

<p>
<sect2>Netvista Clients
<p>
The Netvista Clients (2200 and 2800) have been designed to run Linux 
natively, those thin clients are not based on PowerPC Chips but on an 
Intel Chipset therefore running linux on those devices is quite 
straightforward



<sect1>Software
<p>
<sect2>IBM Software.

<p>
<sect3>Netstation Software
<p>
NC kernel, fonts etc.

In order to boot the NC you will need its Kernel and fonts.
About 25Mb of files are needed on the server.
They can be found on an AIX 4.X with the Netstation modules installed.
Or from the 
<htmlurl url="http://service.boulder.ibm.com/nc/rs6000/index.html"
name="IBM Netstation Download Page">
<p>


<sect3>Netvista Software
<p>

<sect2>NFS Server.
<p>
A working NFS server, like in every default Linux distribution.   
Approx 85Mb of diskspace has to be exported to the NC. (this includes a
lot of documentation which you don't acutally need) 
<p>

<sect2>X Server.
<p>
Any machine running XDM with enough memory, processor power will do.
You don't need to have X configured on the machine itselve, it can
be a head-less server. Basic X Windows install will provide
you with the necessary deamons.

<p> 
There is the possibility to run a local X11 server which may avoid some
network traffic.  The new version supports a standard X11  and a Motif
X11 server.  Using  a configurable menu or by allowing telnet sessions
you may access other computers/servers on the network.
<p>You may also be able to export applications to your Netstation
display withouth actually using XDM . You might want to run an extra window manager.
This can be done by telnetting into the remote box and typing export DISPLAY=nc_ipnr:0
and afterwards running the application you want to use.
<p>


Optional

<sect2>DHCP Server
<p>
If you have multiple NC's, you may wish to distribute the IP Adresses 
by using a DHCP Server
how to obtain and configure a DHCP server can be read in the
<htmlurl url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/DHCP/index<.html
" name="
DHCP Mini Howto on sunsite">

<p>



<sect>Setting up the Server side
<p>
You found all the software you needed.  Now let's install them.
<sect1>IBM Netstations using the AIX binaries.

<p>
Before making the tarball on the aix machine, make sure you run
/usr/netstation/bin/agree in order to make the kernel in a usable format.
Probably you will have to do the same thing with the tarball you get from
the IBM website.  So finding the kernel separatly might be another
solution.
Find a drive with about 25Mb of free diskspace, I use /usr/netstation/,
and unpack the tarbal either from the IBM website or from an AIX machine.
There is no need in using the approx 60Mb from /usr/netstation/doc on
the disk if you don't have enough diskspace.
</sect1>

<sect1>Not using the AIX binaries.
<p>
This section has been contributed by Ken Collins and still have to be
crosschecked by me.
</p>
<p>

<itemize>
<item> Download nsmsetup.exe from

<htmlurl
url="ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/pc/pccbbs/network_station/nsmsetup.exe" 
name="ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/pc/pccbbs/network_station/nsmsetup.exe"> 
<item> I don't have NT set up, so I moved it over into a Win98 partition
and tried executing nsmsetup.exe. It extracted properly, then choked
on the install and removed all the install files. Then I tried opening
it with WinZip, and that worked. I just extracted everything into my
Windows partition under the directory C:/netstation.

<item> I then copied everything from C:/netstation/prodbase to my linux
box. I set everything up in /usr/netstation, which I think was a
mistake. I ran strings on parts of the package, and it looks like
/netstation/prodbase is compiled into various programs. I'm going to
try it again with installing in /netstation/prodbase


<item> Booting the kernel worked fine. I'm not sure how much of the rest
of it worked, since I've never seen a working netstation. I'm getting
a lot of error messages, but an X server comes up, and I'm able to
telnet and start Mwm.  I was able to set up xdm and log into my Linux
server, until I botched something. Now I get an IBM login screen that
doesn't allow me to log in.
</itemize>
<p>
Some readers have helped out here.  What you need to do is create a file 
new file that will be included in your standard.nsm or modify that file.

e.g. 

You can create a file called local.nsm with the following contents  
(10.1.89.33 is your Linux Box)
<verb>
set exec-startup-commands = { {"login 10.1.89.33"} }
set xserver-access-control-enabled = false
set tcpip-name-server-protocol = dns
set tcpip-name-servers = {{ 10.1.89.33 } }
</verb>
and you add 
<verb>
read local.nsm
</verb>
to standard.nsm.

An alternative is to change 
a single line in
/netstation/prodbase/configs/required.nsm from
{ actlogin }
to
{ login }
to get an xdm chooser or
{ login xx.xx.xx.xx }
to do a direct xdm query to your linux box.  There's a
third way but we haven't got confirmation on this.

{ actlogin -authserv xx.xx.xx.xx }


<p>
Philip Tait wrote to tell us this :
"From the directory tree extracted from nsmsetup.exe using WinZIP
classic, copy the entire tree  under "Prodbase" to /netstation.  Export
/netstation, and proceed as for the following sections.
</p>

<p>Bram Piket  wrote in with even a better version.

After downloading the nsmsetup.exe file you should run this file. 
There will be a probe to install the NetworkStation under this win-system.
That does not succeed (in my case?).
Don't click the last error-window away. Then there is left a tempory 
NetStation-directory: "Ixp000.tmp".
Copy the subdirectories to the linux-dir "/netstation".
Rename "x11" to "X11", "en_us" to "EN_US".
Then edit the file
"/netstation/prodbase/configs/required.nsm" to reflect 
<verb>
set exec startup-commands=(
( mcuis )
( login vvv.xxx.yyy.zzz )
)
</verb>
where vvv.xxx.yyy.zzz is the LINUX-server address.

Just point the device to boot from the bflash images you downloaded and 
your firmware will upgrade itselve !.

Your NC should now be able to mount the /usr/netsation by NFS.

Bascially if you don`t need X-Windows this is as far as it gets.  You can
easily telnet from your NC with nothing more installed.  However the beauty
of this thing is it`s X capability.
<sect2>Setting up the X server
<p>
Next we have to set up the X server.  Basically I didn't need to set up
anything, all of my machines that ran X-Windows were configured to accept
connections.  I just started up the NC for the first time and it showed me
all the machines that ran an XDM (cfr running an X -indirect).  So any
machine that can run xdm can be used as X Server.  Just make sure XDM is
So any machine that can run xdm can be used as X Server.  Just make sure
XDM is started.  


</sect2>

<sect1>Setting up Automatic Client configuration
<p>
This part has been contributed by<htmlurl 
url="mailto:jjhill@comdisco.com" name="Josef Hill">

what I'm including
is the line for using the NS1000 with no configuration done on the box.
(defaults.. everything is left blank)


inetd.conf:
<verb>
tftp dgram udp wait nobody /usr/sbin/tcpd in.tftpd /QIBM
</verb>

then create a directory /QIBM/ProdData/NetworkStation/

and copy the contents of the prodbase directory in the winzip sfx nsmsetup.exe
which you can download from
http://techsupport.services.ibm.com/dl/nc/priv/netsta-rd_nsm (you may need to
create an account to access this.. it's free and requires no real information.)
note that this download is 90some MB 

At this point, if you've done the 3 requisite steps, your netstation will boot.
<itemize>
<item> set up DHCP
<item> enable TFTP to the QIBM directory
<item> copy the contents of the prodbase directory to the proper path
</itemize>
Note: It will probably help an awful lot if you have xdm set up (speciffically
for xdmcp sessions).


If you use this approach you can obviously skip the next part ! ;-)


</p>

<p> Everything on the server side should be setup now. 
Lets try the NC side.


</sect>


<sect>Configuring the Thin Client
<sect1>Auto Config
<p>
If you have setup autoconfig as described above you shouldn`t be reading 
this part unless it doesn`t work
</p>

<sect1>Netstation Clients
<p>
Unplug the network cable from the NC. Then boot it up.

After checking its Memory, VGA etc, it will boot into the  IBM Network
Station Setup Utility.  Basically you can manage everything from this menu
system.  The main parts will be described here.
<sect2>Setting up TCP/IP
<p>
Section 5 (F5) :
Your network setup should look something like this :
<p><p>
<verb>
IP Addressed From				 NVRAM
Network Station IP Adress       	         10.0.0.50
First Boot Host IP Adress                        10.0.0.1
Second Boot Host IP Adress      	         10.0.0.11
Third Boot Host IP Adress      		         0.0.0.0
Gateway IP Adress               	         10.0.0.1
Subnet Mask                                      255.255.255.0
Broadcast IP Adress                     	 10.0.0.255
Ethernet Standard 		                 Version 2 
</verb>
<p><p>



Resembles my setup.  The NC itself has 10.0.0.50
While 10.0.0.1 is the NFS Server, 10.0.0.11 is a secondary NFS server,
just in case.


<sect2>Setting Up the Boot Parameters
<p>
Section 6 (F6):
Looks like this in my setup.
<p><p>
<verb>
Boot file 				kernel
TFTP Boot Directory			/usr/netstation/
NFS Boot Directory			/usr/netstation/
Configuration File			/usr/netstation/configs/standard.nsm
Configuration Directory			/usr/netstation/configs
TFTP Order				2
NFS Order				1
MOP Order				Disabled
Local Order				Disabled
</verb><p>


Where /usr/netstation is the directory export on 10.0.0.1

<sect2>Setting Up the Monitor
<p>
Section 7 (F7):
You can choose the right resolution / refresh rate from a nice menu.  I
have mine running on an old 14" VGA Screen running in 1024x768 @60Hz
<p>

Basically that's all you need to install.
<p>
Just plug in your Network cable again. And Reboot the NC.
After testing the  Video / DRAM, the NC will search the
Host system and request the startup information, download the Kernel
from the NFS and boot up.

In some cases, the NC might download an updated Firmware from the host.


<p>
When starting the graphical Console you should get a menu bar and a screen
where you can select the X Hosts.
You are now
in the CLE (Common Login Environment): it's a desktop from where you can
start all sessions, either telnet or X .  It uses a local window
manager which is a small window manager based on MWM.
 <p> 
Your NC is  now setup. Congratulations ! <p>
<sect2>Further Configuration
<p>
Further configuration of the NC can be done e.g. be setting the colors, window
sizes, default keymaps etc.  I'm not going to describe these in detail.
If you have troubles finding your way through the menu system. The IBM
Network Station Runtime Environment for RS/6000 User's Guide  which
can be found in either .pdf or .ps at
<htmlurl url="http://www.as400.ibm.com/networkstation/rs6000/" name=
"http://www.as400.ibm.com/networkstation/rs6000/"> and will provide
you
with detailed information.



<sect1>Netvista Clients 
<p>


Newer versions of the Setup screen might look like this
<p>

<itemize>
<item>F2 = View Hardware Configuration
<item>F3 = Set Network Parameters
<item>F4 = Set Boot Parameters
<item>F5 = Set Configuration Parameters
<item>F6 = Set Monitor Parameters
<item>F7 = Set Language Parameters
<item>F10 = Set Verbose Diagnostic Message Disabled
</itemize>

With F3 you get a panel to set the IP adresses of the Station, the boot
server
and the gateways as well as the subnet mask. With F4 you get a panel to
set the
boot kernel name and path and method (tftp or NFS). F5 brings you to a
panel to
set your configuration files and paths.

<p>




<sect>Misc Stuff
<p>

<sect1>Experiences (NC100)
<p>
Using the NC as a plain terminal with multiple consoles.
The Built-in Motif extensions are a lot easier to use than the
default setup ;-)
Pressing the Pause/Break key will pop up the NC Menu at any time.
<p>
<sect1>Connecting through a network into the NC (NC100)
<p>

	The network station allows configuration access via telnet sessions on
several ports. The ones I know are by default configured like this:
<p>
<itemize>
<item>port 87,     service SerialSD,  (raw - serial daemon)
<item>port 5964,   service ParallelD, (raw - parallel daemon)
<item>port 5976,   service FILED,     (raw - file manager)
<item>port 5977,   service PREFD,     (raw - user preferences)
<item>port 5978,   service DIAG,      (raw - diagnostics)
<item>port 5979,   service CONFIGD,   (raw - configuration)
<item>port 5996,   service FILED,     (telnet - file manager)
<item>port 5997,   service PREFD,     (telnet - user preferences)
<item>port 5998,   service DIAG,      (telnet - diagnostics)
<item>port 5999,   service CONFIGD,   (telnet - configuration)
</itemize>
<p>
You can easliy access the TCP ports by using a telnet session
 telnet NC-IPaddr port.
Be careful whether there is a password check enabled.
The passphrase 'public' (without quotes) worked for me.

<sect2>Port 5978

<p>
Remote Logging
It's the same as the messages console in your CLE.
<p>
The format of each entry stretches over 2 lines. 
<p>
+ DD:HH:MM:SS
NSKxxxx: ...
<p>
The first line covers date using the string that counts days, hours,
minutes and
seconds since boot time. The second line starts with an message identifier
and the

<sect2>Port 5999 CONFIGD
<p>

Use this port to do remote configuration for the NC by an telnet session
(telnet
NC-IPaddr 5999).
<P>

<P>Here are some first commands and hints that seemed to me to be useful.
You can apparently configure the NC remotely - online.  The configuration
files use the same format, but do allow only an offline configuration.   
As an alternative you may use the setup
function
from the NC menu window.</P>

<P> First of all you will need to login if you defined a password.
Logging into the NC should show you a sequence like:
<verb>
*** NCD X Terminal Configuration ***
Password:
Invalid Password
Password: public
</verb>

<P> Being logged in, you can start configurating.
The configuration syntax is identical to
/usr/netstation/configs/  the setup files.
Be aware that the behaviour within this command line interface is
the same as using the gui, i.e. when you set
(you may omit this keyword)
some parameter you need to apply it.
Otherwise you will not see any effect.
There is a /usr/netstation/configs/configd.doc
documentation file (- more precisely I would call it a
reference script -) delivered with the netstation software.
(The links are configured for the RS/6000 installation.)

<P> You probably want to start straight into the matter.
So for learning it the hard way, I recommend some commands to start with:.

<itemize>
<item>help - shows you all possible commands with some really short
explanation.  Some commands concerning locking should be used with care.
<item>get groups -  tells you which groups of configuration options
are available.  These are the subjects in the setup browser of the NC
menu.  You may think of them as section headers.  These group names are
also the first token in the name of the
configurable items within it. 
<item>get boot ... slow in answering and shows you how the boot
parameters of the NC are currently set.
<item>get tftp - again some basic boot parameters.  On my NC
all are read only statistics
<item>get tcpip -  most useful for reading some TCP statistics, less
useful for changing the IP setup, i.e. name servers, local DNS cache, ARP
configuration.
<item>get file - again slow response.  A long list of parameters.
Most of them are again self explaining.  Be careful when changing the port
parameters, since you might have problems to find them later on. Also some
important boot parameters can be
found here.
<item>get nfs - shows NFS configuration.  You most likely will only
need it, if you use a memory PCMCIA card.  Otherwise you will have little
to import or export.
<item>info - shows you NAME, ACCESS, and PROTECTION of a
given or all variables.  Helpful, if you work with protect
</itemize>

<sect1> Port 161/udp - SNMP Access

<P> 
You need some network management software to work with it.
Among the most famous commercial ones are (Tivoli) NetView and HP
OpenView.
They provide an easy-to-use user interfaces.  For linux you usually use
cmu-snmp for command line and TCL/TK-based scotty
for visual frontend.  (I like command line and that's what I am going to
explain)



<sect2> Some general statement    
<P>
The network station is completely configurable as already noted.
In allows examinations and alterations while being used.
The changes take effect either immediately, at session startup,
or at boot time (see configd.doc).
All reads from the network station do not unveal the users display
contents, and therefore the users' privacy is respected
(if the application itself respects it as well).
Only the configuration may be retrieved,
but not the window contents (at least not this way).
<sect2> How to configure network management ? 
<P>
There is a file in ASN.1 called  snmpmib.txt  in the  
installation directory of the recent releases that allows your
network management console resolve the mib symbols.
Otherwise you see dot-separated sequences of numbers only.
So best is to append this file (comments start with double
minus "--") to the  mib.txt file of your SNMP software.
You can use snmpwalk, snmpget, snmpset to browse and modify the symbols
you have retrieved.

<sect2> How to start managing? 
<P>
Simplest way to start managing is to execute the commands
<p>
<verb>
snmpwalk NC-IPaddr public system
snmpget NC-IPaddr public system.sysDescr.0
snmpset NC-IPaddr public system.sysContact.0 s"MailTo:Kris.Buytaert@advalvas.b$
snmpwalk NC-IPaddr public system
</verb>
<p>
Sit back and think a little bit about it.  It is easy to work with.
</P>
<P>If you never had experience with SNMP commands you should read some
SNMP
documentation, take reference to configd.doc.
For more details refer to SNMP-HowTos.
</P>
<sect2> What do you manage? 
<P> 


It works nearly the same way as the telnet session to the configuration
port,
except that each command is transferred separately to the NC using UDP.
The advantage is that you do not have to work interactively, you work with
UDP
instead of TCP, which avoids retries to network stations that are down.
you must have the privileges for being successful - 'public' is a good
community for reading...






<sect1>IBM Software Releases
<p>
IBM Has a special program for upgrades and documentation about the IBM
Netststation releases.  It includes CDs and printed documentation
<p>
It can  be ordered freely from IBM from the following url <htmlurl
url="http://service.boulder.ibm.com/nc/pcserver/cd_order.shtml" 
name="service.boulder.ibm.com/nc/pcserver/cd_order.shtml">.

<sect1>NetworkStation Manager
<p>

The NetworkStation Manager is a piece of software running on the boot
server. It has a web interface and allows you to administrate all your
NetworkStations from a single point.
You can define users and groups and provide a customised desktop for each
of them. 
<p>
This is required if you don't use a windowmanager provided by Linux.
It basically works by parsing and writing the configuration files.  However, Linux is not a supported plattform of this software. So as a workaround you have to change the configuration files by hand or have an
OS/390, an AIX or a Windows NT do the job for you. Please be aware, that
for the personalisation in users and groups of your NetworkStation
Desktop, you need the login daemon running on your boot server. This
daemon is not available on Linux. So personalisation has to be done by
naming the configuration files according to the user sitting
at the Station.
<p>
<P>There is an actual Redbook about the Network Station,

<htmlurl url="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpieces/abstracts/sg245844.html" 
name="Network Station Manager V2R1">

, IBM PubNumber SG24-5844-00.
For the use with Linux it may be helpful for you to read
<htmlurl url="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg242016.html" name="
IBM Network Station - RS/6000 Notebook">, 
IBM PubNumber SG24-2016-01.
It explains the use with the RS/600 AIX System (an interesting flavour of
Unix).
</P>


<sect1>Configuration file statements
<p>
Here are some configuration file statements that I found useful:

set boot-prom-force-update = true
With this setting, the Network Station will check for a new boot PROM (aka
Firmware) and download it if available.

set xserver-access-control-enabled = false
Will allow all XClients to connect to the XServer running on that Network
Station.

<p>
<sect1>Printing
<p>

(contributed by Bram Piket) 
</p><p>
To get printing work you have do two configuration steps.
One on the Netstation and one on the printsystem of the server.
</p>
<p>
On the Netstation : 
<p>

Pop up the IBM Network Station User Services window (standard with 
Alt-Shift-Home) or reboot the Netstation terminal.
</p>
<p>
As stated on page 184 of the named IBM Redbook:
</p>
<p>
In Setup -> Changes Setup Parameters, choose Print:
</p>
<p>
Add in Lpr-Servers:
Server: localhost
Queue Name: PARALLEL1
Datastream type: ps (postscript)
</p>
<p>

Save with Apply and as a file.
Add this file to:
/netstation/prodbase/configs/defaults.dft
</p>
<p>
On the printer side
</p>
<p>
Assumed is a cups printsystem.
You have to be root to administrate cups.
Within a webbrowser open the cups-setup (localhost:631).
In Administration -> Add Printer
Name your printer and give the device URI:
</p>
<p>

lpd://ppp.qqq.rrr.sss/PARALLEL1,
</p>
<p>

where ppp.qqq.rrr.sss = IP-adress of the Netstation.
</p>

<p> There is a Redbook about printing, 'IBM Network Station Printing Guide',
IBM
PubNumber SG24-5212-00. Redbooks can be found at

<sect1>PCMCIA Memory Cards 
<p>
<htmlurl url="mailto:ANeuper@antaris.de" 
name="ANeuper@antaris.de"> the author of this paraphrase.

<P>I have tested memory cards manufactured by Centennial (IBM
gives you a more complete list of memory cards that work with the NC).
I recommend a minimum capacity of 20 MB.
If you have less you will have less functionality on the card.
Even 20MB is hardly sufficient.  Once a NC is installed
with a memory card it can serve as peer booting host for other NCs
in its network vicinity.</P>
<P>You need to connect to the file manager port 5996.
Keep a eye on your access protections in your configuration files.
If you use the memory card with the network station for the first
time, you need to format it.  You should mount it and export it. 
once you have exported it (<TT>showmount -e NC-IPaddr</TT>) you
can mount it to your boot server (<TT>mount NC-IPaddr:/local /mnt</TT>)
and transfer  the setup directory(<TT> cp -r /usr/netstation/* /mnt</TT>).
Be careful not to forget some necessary files, particularily some
X11 files are needed.  The full directory will not fit on the card.
Avoid erasing on the chip card, claiming the freed space isn't easy
and wastes space.</P>

<P>For more detailed information you have place an PRPQ at IBM
(whatever this means), contact some IBM representative or contact

</P>

<sect1>Setup
<p>
It seems the "user preferences" are stored in NVRAM, while "quick
setup" and "setup parameters" are read from the boot server (in NFS,
/netstation/prodbase/configs/standard.nsm).
</p>

<sect1>Images
<p>
The screensaver and background reads XBM images, Linux/BSD/*nix users can
use XV to export to this format.  The screensaver image shown will be 
inverted.
</p>

<sect1>Time Sync
<p>
The units don't use NTP, instead inetd's built-in unix time
(37/udp) support, I'd personally recommend using xinetd.
</p>

<sect1>Test Network
<p>
This is User Sevices Console version of ping.
</p>

<sect1>BIOS
<p>
Setting a global password will password-protect the "BIOS" setup.  
According to Matthew Poertner 

You can reset the NVRAM on the netstations (tested on 110 and 300 types) using the
following commands:
<verb>
>From Setup Utility:
-CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+F1
-NV
-R
-L
-S
Are you Sure? Yes
-Q
Reboot and Reconfig
</verb>


However if this doesn't work yet, you can always try to ...
<verb>
1. Power Off
2. open it, everything attached
3. above the pcmcia slot, right hand there are two blank metal spots, 
about 1 mm square, connect them (e.g. with a screwdriver) and power on the 
netstation
4. watch the boot sequence, some when it should say sth. like "NVRAM 
cleared or so"
5. Power Off, close it, and everything should be wonderful!
</verb>

If that still doesn't work I don't have a clue ;(
 </p>

<sect1>Features
<p>
Most units (8361-110 for sure) features not only support for X (as an
Xterminal) and NC (Windows NT Terminal Server) usage, it's built-in
console also has
support for serial (locally attached and dial-up using PPP/SLIP, also
telnet connections. 
</p>

There are a lot of new resources online about Linux on the PPC40X. Here is a small list of them.
<htmlurl url="http://www.borg.umn.edu/~grant/Linux/" name="http://www.borg.umn.edu/~grant/Linux/">  it seems like some of the Netstations contain a 
403GC[X] on
this page you can find a Linux kernel for that PPC.  If anybody succeeds please contacte me !
<htmlurl url="http://www.mvista.com/products/405gp_status/main.html" name="http://www.mvista.com/products/405gp_status/main.html"> Montavista Software is doing

<sect>FAQ
<p>


<itemize>
<item>Q: Can you run a Linux kernel on the Netstation 
A:  Depending on the type you have you can get linux running.  Both 2200
and 2800 models are running Linux out of the box.  
As of november 2002 we have a succesful boot of a linux kernel on an IBM Netstation 1000.

I'm waiting for
feedback on the 110, 300 types.  The 100 is not running linux
at the moment, it has no MMU so therefore the Linux port is a bit more
difficult.

<item>Q: Are there any mailing lists about the Netstation
A: Take a look to the Other Usefull Documentation part in this howto ..

<item>Q: I have a 2200 or a 2800 and the instructions in your HOWTO don't
work QM  The 2200 and 2800 are not based on the PPC architecture anymore ,
they have a more frequently used chipset which is supported by Linux and
these things run Linux natively.  
<item>Q: I have no AIX available how can I unpack the kernel A: There is a
new section in the howto that describes how to use another way to do
this. 
<item>Q:  I get an Invalid Kernel Type while trying to boot
the NC.
A: You didn't run the agree script on your aix machine.
<item>Q: I log in at the remote host and my keyboard settings
are incorrect.
A: I use no ~/.Xmodap when working on the NC.  This keeps my
keyboardsettings perfect.
