<abstract>
  This document describes how a <idx>blind</idx> user can use Linux
with a <idx>speech synthesizer</idx> to replace the video display.  It
describes how to get Linux running on your own PC, and how to set it
up for speech output.  It suggests how to learn about Unix.

<sect>Introduction

<p>
   <idx>Emacspeak</idx> is an <idx>Emacs</idx> subsystem that allows
the user to get feedback using synthesized speech.

   Screen reading programs allow a visually impaired user to get
feedback using synthesized speech. Such programs have been
commercially available for well over a decade. Most of them run on
PC's under DOS, and there are now a few <idx>screen-readers</idx> for the
Windows platform.  However, screen-readers for the UNIX environment
have been conspicuous in their absence.

   This means that most <idx>visually impaired</idx> computer users
face the additional <idx>handicap</idx> of being DOS-impaired :-)

   Emacspeak is an emacs subsystem that provides basic speech access.
Emacspeak will always have the shortcoming that it will only work
under Emacs.  This said, there is very little that cannot be done
inside Emacs, so it's not a real shortcoming:-) Within Emacs, you can
open a "shell window" where you can run commands and examine their output,
even output which has scrolled out of the window.  Emacs provides
special modes for running certain commands.  For example, it can parse
error messages printed by a compiler and open a separate edit window
with the cursor at the point of the error.  It can also run a debugger
and keep a separate edit window open at the point in the source code
corresponding to the program counter.

   Emacspeak does have a significant advantage: since it runs inside
Emacs, a structure-sensitive, fully customizable editor, Emacspeak
often has more context-specific information about what it is speaking
than its commercial counterparts.  In this sense, Emacspeak is not a
"screenreader", it is a subsystem that produces speech output.  A
traditional screen-reader speaks the content of the screen, leaving
it to the user to interpret the visually laid-out information.
Emacspeak, on the other hand, treats speech as a first-class output
mode; it speaks the information in a manner that is easy to
comprehend when listening.

   This initial version provides a basic speech subsystem for Emacs;
using Emacs' power and flexibility, it has proven straightforward to
add modules that customize how things are spoken, e.g. depending on
the major/minor mode of a given buffer.  Note that the basic speech
functionality provided by Emacspeak is sufficient to use most Emacs
packages effectively; adding package-specific customizations makes
the interaction much smoother.  This is because package-specific
extensions can take advantage of the current context.

   Emacspeak will only work with emacs.  However, emacs can be used to
run any program that has a command-line interface (ls, cd, rm,
adduser, etc.).  In general use M-x shell to run such programs.

   You can even run those like less or lynx which use escape sequences
to control the appearance of the screen.  The key to this is term
mode, which you get with the emacs command M-x term.  

   Let me insert here some explanation, because the word "terminal" is
used in several senses.  The original terminal was of course an
electromechanical device that translated keystrokes into character
codes and received the same codes and printed the characters.
Eventually these were replaced by entirely electronic "dumb terminals"
which also implemented escape sequences to clear the screen, move the
cursor, etc.  Unix adapted to these by introducing an abstract notion
of a "terminal" with very general capabilities.  A program like a text
editor issues generic commands, which are translated into
the commands suitable for your terminal.  The choice of translation is
controlled by the variable "TERM" in the environment.  One common
value for this variable is "vt100", since many terminals implement the
same commands as the DEC VT100.  The Emacs command `M-x term' starts a
virtual terminal with its own set of cursor commands.  It notifies the
operating system of this by setting the environment variable "TERM" to
the value "eterm" (which is why it is sometimes called eterm mode).

   Note that this Unix "terminal" is concerned only with escape
commands for the display.  Let me just mention a couple of other kinds
of "terminal" to distinguish them from the Unix concept: For DOS,
there are "terminal emulators" like COMMO and TELIX that simulate a
terminal, and can be used to connect to a remote computer via a serial
port (and usually a modem).  That is, they accept keystrokes and send
the character codes out a serial port, and receive character codes
from the serial port and display them.  Unix has similar programs,
such as minicom and seyon.  Both DOS and Unix have another program
called "telnet" which can establish a similar connection to a separate
computer using the Internet (that is, a TCP/IP connection rather than
a serial connection).  The program "kermit" is available for both DOS
and Unix, and can establish either kind of connection.  However, none
of these should be confused with the eterm mode of emacs.  There is
nothing about eterm mode that implies a connection to a remote
computer.

   Note that in most cases there is an emacs mode that works better
than the separate program in an eterm buffer.  That is, instead of
"less", just open a buffer on the file.  Instead of "lynx", use w3.
Instead of "man", use `M-x man', and type the name of the program in
the minibuffer.  

   Remember, though: ordinary command-line oriented programs are best
run in shell mode, which starts with the command `M-x shell'.

   Emacs is a large program, but it does not all have to be in RAM,
because Linux has virtual memory.  You can designate a swap partition,
so that programs (or parts of programs) can be swapped out when they
are not being used.  You can comfortably run emacs with 8 MB of ram
plus 8 MB of swap space.

This document is limited to the following:

<item>Linux (not Free BSD)
<item>The Slackware distribution (not Red Hat, Debian, etc.)
<item>Speech output only (not Braille - see the Access HOWTO)

</itemize>

The use of <idx>adaptive technology</idx> with Linux, and in
particular, using adaptive technology to make Linux accessible to
those who could not use it otherwise, is covered in the Linux Access
HOWTO.

If you would like to help extend this document to cover one or more of
the other alternatives, or point me to a discussion
somewhere else, please contact me.

The most recent version of this document should be available in
several formats at <url
url="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/"> and its mirrors
(see below).  The plain text version should be available at <url
url="ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/doc/">.

Emacspeak was written by T. V. Raman <tt/raman@adobe.com/.  Emacspeak
has a Web page at <url url=
"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/raman/emacspeak/emacspeak.html">.

Emacspeak supports several speech synthesizers.  The software required
depends on which you have.

If you have a DECtalk Express or MultiVoice, you need the basic
Emacspeak package, tcl (an interpreter), and tclx (extensions for
tcl).  You can get the source package for Emacspeak from the Emacspeak
web page.
You can also get a binary package for a Red Hat distribution, either
from the Emacspeak web page or one prepared by Matt Campbell.
I maintain binary packages for the Debian distribution.
At this writing, the most recent
release of Emacspeak is version 13.0.  Here are some URLs:
<tscreen>
<url url="http://www.pobox.com/~mattcampbell/emacspeak.html">
<url url="http://leb.net/pub/blinux/emacspeak/cornell.mirror">
<url url="ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/raman/emacspeak/">
<url url="ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/emacspeak/blinux/emacspeak-6.0-2.i386.rpm">
<url url="http://www.mv.com/ipusers/vanzandt/">
</tscreen>

Note: there are European mirrors of the blinux site which you should use if they closer:
<tscreen>
<url url="ftp://ftp.uni-muenster.de/share/public6/">
<url url="ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/blinux/">
</tscreen>

For the internal DECtalk PC, you also need a kernel driver which is
available from
<url url= "ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/dectalk_pc-0.91.tgz">

Extract it with the command: `tar xfz dectalk_pc-0.91.tgz'
and then follow the installation instructions found in the README file.
This driver apparently works with both the original DECTALK-pc and the new
DECTALK-PC II.

For the external DoubleTalk, LiteTalk, Accent, or Apollo synthesizers,
	or for the Braille 'n Speak, Type 'n Speak, or Braille Lite
	devices in "speech box" mode, you need the Emacspeak
package and a separate "speech server" which comes in the emacspeak-ss package:
<tscreen>
<url url= "ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/emacspeak/blinux/emacspeak-ss-1.7.tar.gz">
</tscreen>

For the internal DoubleTalk, you need three pieces of software: the
basic Emacspeak package, the emacspeak-ss package, and
a device driver.  The device driver is
now part of the official Linux kernel sources.  Use version 2.2.17 or
later, and configure with "Double Talk PC internal speech card
support" either compiled into the kernel or installed as a module
(dtlk.o).
 
There is a server for the Braille 'n Speak,
Braille Lite, and Type 'n Speak devices used in "speech box" mode:
<tscreen>
<url url="ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/emacspeak/blinux/emacspeak-bs-tcl-1.2.tar.gz">
<url url="ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/emacspeak/blinux/emacspeak-bs-tcl&lowbar;1.2-1&lowbar;all.deb">
<url url="ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/emacspeak/blinux/emacspeak-bs-1.2-1.i386.rpm">
</tscreen>
Once again, the emacspeak-ss server handles all the synthesizers other
than the DECtalk.  You should use that one if you don't mind
building and installing a source package.

Computer hardware, Unix user commands, Unix system administration,
Emacs, and Emacspeak are each substantial subjects.  Attempting to
learn all of them at once is likely to lead to frustration.  Instead,
I suggest that the new user go through a sequence of stages, learning
about only one system at a time.

<sect>Stage 1. DOS with speech
<p>
Most blind computer users have DOS or Windows, a speech synthesizer,
and a screen reader program like JAWS &lsqb;<ref id="jaws"
name="JAWS">&rsqb;.  (References in this format refer to entries in
the "Footnotes and References" section below.)  Using this setup,
install and become familiar with some terminal emulator like Telix
&lsqb;<ref id="telix" name="TELIX">&rsqb; or Commo &lsqb;<ref
id="commo" name="COMMO">&rsqb;, which are available from the SimTel
archive &lsqb;<ref id="simtel" name="SimTel">&rsqb; among others.

<sect1>Getting Linux on CDROM
<p>
If you have or can borrow a CDROM drive, I recommend you get one of
the many good distributions of Linux on that medium.  The instructions
below are for the Slackware distribution.  I am most
familiar with disks from 
Linux Central &lsqb;<ref id="linuxcentral" name="Linux Central">&rsqb;.  
Other sources are InfoMagic &lsqb;<ref id="infomagic"
name="InfoMagic">&rsqb; and Walnut Creek &lsqb;<ref
id="walnutcreek" name="Walnut Creek">&rsqb; (where the whole idea of
inexpensive CDROMs full of programs from Internet archives got its
start).  Linux distributions are also available from Red Hat
&lsqb;<ref id="redhat" name="Red Hat">&rsqb;, Craftwork &lsqb;<ref
id="craftwork" name ="Craftwork">&rsqb;, and Yggdrasil &lsqb;<ref
id="ygg" name="Yggdrasil">&rsqb;.  As a rule, these CDROMs use the
"ISO 9660" format, which can be read under DOS.  (They also use the
"Rock Ridge extensions" which add extra files in each directory.
Linux uses the extra information to give you long filenames, both
upper and lower case characters in filenames, and file permissions.)

<sect1>Getting Linux by FTP
<p>
Another way to get Linux and its documentation is by FTP over the
Internet.  The home site for the Slackware distribution is Walnut
Creek &lsqb;<ref id="walnutcreek" name="Walnut Creek">&rsqb;.  It is
also carried by metalab (formerly known as sunsite) and many of it
mirror sites.  Here is a partial list:

<itemize>
<item>USA (home site) <url url="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/linux/slackware">
<item>UK/Europe <url url="ftp://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/public/Mirrors/ftp.cdrom.com/pub/linux/slackware-3.1">
<item>Japan <url url="ftp://ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp/pub/os/linux/slackware">
<item>Taiwan <url url="ftp://NCTUCCCA.edu.tw/OS/Linux/Slackware">

</itemize>

<url url="ftp://uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu/pub/systems/linux/sunsite/docs/HOWTO/INFO-SHEET">
</tscreen>

<sect1>Linux Documentation
<p>
Read the Linux documentation.  I will quote here the file names and
locations on the first disk of InfoMagic's December 1996 "Developer's
Resource" set of six CDROMs, as seen under DOS.  Other CDROM sets
should have similar information, though perhaps differently arranged.
The Slackware distribution is on disk 2 of the set.  Matt Welsh's step
by step guide to installing Slackware is in
<tt/&bsol;doc&bsol;install-&bsol;install-.002/.  (This is a 245 page
book!)

More general information is in the Linux "Frequently Asked Questions"
list in
<tt/&bsol;docs&bsol;linux.faq&bsol;linux-fa.asc/.
Longer descriptions are in "HOWTO" documents (of which this is one).
They are found in <tt/&bsol;docs/.  Note particularly
<tt/&bsol;docs&bsol;hardware/, which lists which kinds of hardware
are supported by Linux, <tt/&bsol;docs&bsol;meta-faq/, which points
to sources of information (that is, a more extensive version of this
paragraph), and <tt/&bsol;help&bsol;index/, which is a list of the
HOWTO documents with short descriptions.  The Linux installation
HOWTO, <tt/&bsol;docs&bsol;installation/, is another (much shorter,
somewhat older) version of Matt
Welsh's installation instructions.

One note on reading the documentation.  You may run into files
with ASCII highlighting, where character-backspace-character stands
for "bold", and underscore-backspace-character stands for "italics".
One way to handle this is to use the <tt/less/ program, which displays
these sequences in alternate colors.  A DOS screenreader can, for
example, search for such highlighted text.  A DOS version of <tt/less/
can be obtained by FTP from the SimTel archive &lsqb;<ref id="simtel"
name="SimTel">&rsqb;.  Within the SimTel collection, look for
directory msdos/textutil.  For example, try <url
url="ftp://ftp.coast.net/pub/SimTel/msdos/textutil">.

I will suggest four alternatives for learning Emacs commands (see
section &lsqb;<ref id="emacs" name="Learning Emacs">&rsqb;).  The
first option is to install Emacs under DOS and learn it while using
the DOS screen reader.  Where to get Emacs for DOS is a "frequently
asked question" &lsqb;<ref id="dos-emacs" name="Emacs for DOS">&rsqb;.

The source code for Emacs (about 10 MB) can be gotten from <url
url="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/"> (look for emacs-19.34b.tar.gz or
similar), or from one of many mirrors of the GNU collection &lsqb;<ref
id="gnu" name="Gnu Mirrors">&rsqb;.

<sect>Stage 2. Terminal to remote UNIX system
<p> 

Arrange for what is called a "<idx>shell account</idx>" on some Unix
system.  Most Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can provide this
service.  Use the <idx>terminal emulator</idx> program and a modem to
dial in.  Learn the basic Unix commands.  If the system has Emacs
installed, or you can persuade the system administrator to install it,
this is your second chance to learn it.  It is probably best to learn
it at this point, because administering a Unix system (the next stage)
will call for you to edit files.  Therefore, I include here my
suggestions for learning both Unix and Emacs.

<sect1>Learning Unix<label id="unix">

<p>
When you arrange for a shell account, or set up a new account on your
own machine, you will have to decide on a username and a password.
Your username will also be used in your email address, so try to find
something short and memorable.  Your password is important, and should
be hard to guess.  That usually means at least six characters,
including at least one non-alphanumeric character.

When a Unix system is ready for you to log in, it normally
displays a prompt ending with "login:".  At this point you should type
in your username.  It will then prompt you for your password, and will
turn off command echoing while you type it in.

The command to finish a terminal session is <tt/logout/.  

There are many kinds of documentation available on a Linux system.
Traditionally, each command has a manual page which can be
displayed by the  <tt/man/ command.  For example, learn more about
the <tt/cp/ command by typing <tt/man cp/.  Of course, this helps only if
you know or can guess the command name.  However, each man page has a
line near the beginning with the command name and a
short description of what the command does.  You can search a database
of these lines using the command <tt/apropos/.  Thus, typing <tt/apropos
working/ will list lines that include the word "working".  Here's what
that command prints here:
<tscreen>
<verb>
cd (n)               - Change working directory
pwd (n)              - Return the current working directory
Cwd (3pm)            - get pathname of current working directory
chdir (2)            - change working directory
fchdir (2)           - change working directory
get_current_dir_name (3) - Get current working directory
getcwd (3)           - Get current working directory
getwd (3)            - Get current working directory
pwd (1)              - print name of current/working directory
rcsclean (1)         - clean up working files
</verb>
</tscreen>
The numbers in parentheses are sections of the manual.  User commands
are in section 1.  Functions called from within programs are in
sections 2 and 3.  Commands used mostly by the system administrator
are in section 8.  You can find out more about the on-line manual with
the command <tt/man man/.

The program that interprets your command is a "shell".  Under DOS,
COMMAND.COM is the shell.  Most Unix shells are descendents of either
the Bourne shell <tt/sh/ or the C shell <tt/csh/.  The shell most
commonly used with Linux is the "Bourne again shell", or <tt/bash/.
Many Unix commands that were once separate programs are built into
bash.  Help for these is also built in.  For example, typing <tt/help
cd/ will display a short description of the <tt/cd/ command.  Typing
<tt/help/ by itself will display a list of all the builtin commands.
Unfortunately, it is shown in two columns.  If you find this
confusing, you can pipe the list through <tt/colrm/ to eliminate one
column.  Type <tt/help|colrm 37/ to show just the first column, and
<tt/help|colrm 1 36/ to show just the second column.

Many Linux programs from the Free Software Foundation are best
documented in info pages.  For example, the C compiler documentation
can be displayed by typing <tt/info gcc/.

Under Unix, commands normally accept options starting with a
minus sign rather than the forward slash used under DOS.  In a path,
directory names are separated by forward slashes rather than backward
slashes.  Both operating systems have a "standard input", by default
the keyboard, and a "standard output", by default the display screen.
You can redirect the standard input using "&lt;", and redirect the output
using "&gt;".  You can use the output from one command as the input of
another by separating the two commands with "|".  This is called the
"pipe" symbol.

<!--
It has several features which can reduce the need for typing.  You can
use the cursor up key key to bring previous commands to the command
line.  The cursor will be at the end of the command.  You can use
cursor left and right to move the cursor within the command, and edit
it with Emacs style commands (control-D or DEL to delete the character
to the right, et cetera).  Also, you can insert the last word in the
previous command with ESC-. (escape period).  You can learn about
these and other commands from the bash man page, in the section
entitled "READLINE".
-->

If a program gets "stuck", here is a sequence of keystrokes to
try:

<itemize>
<item>Control-Q.  You may have sent a control-S, which halts
all output, without realizing it.  The control-Q will restart it.
<item>Control-D, which signals "end of file" under Unix (similar to control-Z
under DOS), in case the program expects input which you are not
prepared to supply.
<item>Control-C is an interrupt, which may halt the program.
<item>Control-Z puts the program in the background.  At this point you may
simply log out, although you will be warned about the background
process and will have to repeat the <tt/logout/ command.  You can instead
kill the process, as follows: Run <tt/ps/ with no arguments.  It will
list a header line, then one line for each of your processes.  The
first item on each line is the process id number, or PID.  The command
used to start the process (or at least the beginning of it) appears at
the end of the line.  If the PID were 117, you would kill the process
with the command <tt/kill -9 117/.
<item>If running Linux from the console, alt-2, or some other
alt-number combination, will switch to a different virtual console.  
You can log in there just as if you had
sat down to a different terminal.
<item>If your machine is connected to a network, you can log in from
another machine.
<item>Control-alt-del should reboot the computer nondestructively.
<item>As a last resort, you can hit "reset" or cycle the power.
This will leave the filesystems in an invalid state, since some
buffers will not have been written to disk.  The kernel will discover
this while booting, and will take time to check and repair the
filesystems.  Actual data loss is unlikely unless you had something
else going on at the time.

<sect1>Learning Emacs<label id="emacs">

<p>
When you start Emacs, you will normally list on the command line one
or more files which you will be editing.  To edit a file named
"foobar" with Emacs, you would enter the command <tt/emacs foobar/.
If you enter the command <tt/emacs/ with no arguments, GNU Emacs will
print out an introduction which includes the first five commands you
need to learn, approximately as follows:

<verb>
   Type C-h for help;   (`C-' means use CTRL key.)
   Type C-x u to undo changes.
   Type C-h t for a tutorial on using Emacs.
   Type C-h i to enter Info, which you can use to read GNU documentation.
   To kill the Emacs job, type C-x C-c.
</verb>

Note the way Emacs documentation refers to key combinations.
C-h means hold the control key down while typing "h".  You will also
run into key combinations like M-v, which is pronounced "meta v".  The
tutorial suggests holding down the key labeled "edit" or "meta" then
typing "v".  I have never run across a keyboard with those keys, so I
always use the escape key instead: typing "Esc" then "v" (two separate
keystrokes).  After using Emacs for a long time, I discovered that
under Linux, the left "Alt" key works like a "meta" key.  You may want
to use this.  On the other hand, some of these key combinations may
conflict with your screen reader or communications program under DOS.
Using the escape key is more reliable.

Three of the above commands start with C-h, which may be treated as a
backspace by your communications program.  In that case, you may
access the help command using the long form M-x help.  Conversely, you
may find that pressing the backspace key starts the help command.
This issue is treated in the Emacs FAQ, which is available within
Emacs using C-h F or M-x help F.  Look for the question "Why does the
`Backspace' key invoke help?".  In the mean time, you can end the help
session with the command C-g.  (This is the keyboard-quit command,
which cancels any prefix keys you have typed.)

You may also find that C-s and C-q are unavailable because they are
used for flow control (XON and XOFF).  You should look at the question
"How do I handle C-s and C-q being used for flow control?" in the FAQ.
For the particular command C-x C-s (save buffer), you may substitute
the command C-x s (save-some-buffers).  The former command saves the
current buffer, while the latter asks the user about each of the
modified buffers.

Note in particular the command "C-h t" to start the Emacs tutorial.
That is one the first things you will want to try.  I will only make a
couple of comments on the tutorial.  To move the cursor, it gives the
four commands C-f, C-b, C-p, and C-n (for forward, back, previous
line, and next line).  These commands always work.  However, with a
properly installed Emacs, the regular arrow keys should also work.
Try them out and use them if you are more comfortable with them.
Similarly, you may be able to use home, end, page down, and page up
keys in place of the standard commands C-a, C-e, C-v, and M-v.
Finally, all Emacspeak commands begin with C-e.  Once you start using
Emacspeak, you will have to type it twice to get the end of line
function.  (The "End" key should be unaffected by Emacspeak.)



<sect>Stage 3. Terminal to local Linux system
<p>

This arrangement again requires a DOS machine with a speech
synthesizer and a terminal emulator program.  However, instead of
dialing up a remote computer, it is used as a terminal to a local
computer running Linux.  To get to this point, you need to install
Linux on a machine.  You may be able to prevail on a knowledgeable
friend to help you with this.  However, it is also possible to
install it yourself with speech feedback for almost the whole
procedure.  

<sect1>Installing Linux
<p>

First, some background.  Even the simplest Unix system requires a
program called the kernel and a root file system.  The kernel has all
the device drivers and resource management functions.  One normally
thinks of a "file system" as residing on a hard disk or floppy disk,
but during an installation it is usually in ram.  Linux is normally
installed by writing a kernel image to a floppy disk, called the "boot
floppy", configuring it to reserve a section of RAM for a ramdisk,
then filling that ramdisk with data from a second floppy disk, called
the "root floppy".  As soon as both floppies have been read in, the
user can log in as "root" and complete the installation.  The sighted
user logs in on the "system console", that is, the computer's own
keyboard and video display.  However, remember that Unix has been a
multiprocessing operating system from the very beginning.  Even this
very primitive Unix system, running out of a small ramdisk, also
supports logins from a terminal connected to a serial port.  This is
what a blind user can use.

To connect the two computers, you can use a "<idx>null modem</idx>", a
serial cable that connects ground to ground, and transmit on each end
to receive on the other.  The cable that comes with the DOS
application <idx>LapLink</idx> will work fine.  It is particularly
handy, in fact, because it has both a 9 pin and a 25 pin connector on
each end.  If you want to check a cable or have one made, here are the
required connections:

For two 9 pin connectors, connect pin 2 (receive data) to pin
3, pin 3 (transmit data) to pin 2, and pin 5 (signal ground) to pin 5.

For two 25 pin connectors, connect pin 2 (receive data) to pin
3, pin 3 (transmit data) to pin 2, and pin 7 (signal ground) to pin 7.

For a 9 pin connector (first) to a 25 pin connector (second),
connect pin 2 (receive data) to pin 2 (transmit data), pin 3 (transmit
data) to pin 3 (receive data), and pin 5 (signal ground) to pin 7
(signal ground).

You may have noted that I have included no connections for the
"handshaking" signals.  During login, the serial port is handled by
the program <tt/agetty/.  Recent versions of this program accept a -L
switch which tells it not to expect modem control signals.  The
version in Slackware 3.0 does, but the one on the 3.0 (and earlier)
installation root disks does not.  However, Pat Volkerding has assured
me that the root disks in the next release of Slackware will have the
updated version of <tt/agetty/.  It is also possible to use the
earlier root disks &lsqb;<ref id="slackware3.0" name="Emacspeak with
Earlier Slackware Releases">&rsqb;.

Consult the documentation on your CDROM, or downloaded from an FTP
site, and choose a boot disk with the proper kernel features for your
hardware (IDE or SCSI, CDROM driver, etc.).  I have the InfoMagic
September 1996 "Developer's Resource" set of six CDROMs.  Slackware
3.1 is on disk 1 of that set, mostly in the two directories slackwar
and slakware.  (Note the difference in spelling.  You will access them
in alphabetical order: first slackwar, then slakware.)

Documentation on the boot floppies is in
&bsol;bootdsks.144&bsol;which.one.  A copy of the DOS program for
writing boot images to a floppy, rawrite.exe, is in the same
directory.  Assuming the CDROM is the M drive under DOS, one might
use these commands to write to a floppy disk in the A drive:

<tscreen><verb>
	C>m:
	M>cd &bsol;bootdsks.144
	M>rawrite scsinet.s a:
</verb></tscreen>

Similarly, to write the "text" root disk:

<tscreen><verb>
	C>m:
	M>cd &bsol;rootdsks
	M>rawrite text.gz a:
</verb></tscreen>

If you install from floppies, you should also copy the Emacspeak
package onto a floppy with a command like this:

<tscreen><verb>
	C>copy m:&bsol;contrib&bsol;emacspea.tgz a:
</verb></tscreen>

For the actual installation, proceed as follows: Use the null modem to
connect the computer running DOS and equipped with speech output
(which I will call the "DOS machine") to the computer into which you
want to install Linux (the "Linux machine").

Boot the DOS machine, and start your terminal emulation program.  Set
it up for 9600 baud, no parity, eight data bits, 1 stop bit.

On the Linux machine, insert the "boot" disk and boot
(power up, cntl-alt-del, or hit the reset switch).  It should read the
disk for five seconds or so, beep, and stop with the following text:

(Note: in the following, the large blocks of text quoted from the
installation disks are preceded by "-- begin quote" and followed by
"-- end quote".  To skip to the end of a quote, you may search for two
dashes starting in the first column.  I have word wrapped some
sections to limit the line lengths.)

<verb>
-- begin quote
</verb><tscreen><verb>
Welcome to the Slackware96 Linux (v. 3.1.0) bootkernel disk!

If you have any extra parameters to pass to the kernel, enter them at
the prompt below after one of the valid configuration names (ramdisk,
mount, drive2)

Here are some examples (and more can be found in the BOOTING file):

  ramdisk hd=cyl,hds,secs    (Where "cyl", "hds", and "secs" are the
                             number of cylinders, sectors, and heads
                             on the drive.  Most machines won't need
                             this.)

In a pinch, you can boot your system with a command like:
  mount root=/dev/hda1

On machines with low memory, you can use mount root=/dev/fd1 or mount
root=/dev/fd0 to install without a ramdisk.  See LOWMEM.TXT for
details.

If you would rather load the root/install disk from your second
floppy drive: drive2 (or even this: ramdisk root=/dev/fd1)

DON'T SWITCH ANY DISKS YET!  This prompt is just for entering extra
parameters.  If you don't need to enter any parameters, hit ENTER to
continue.

boot:
</verb></tscreen><verb>
-- end quote
</verb>

I have almost always been able to just hit "enter" at this point.

After your entry, the Linux machine should read the floppy for another
twenty seconds or so, then boot the kernel.  The first thing it prints
is "Loading ramdisk...", which is somewhat misleading.  In this case,
"ramdisk" is actually the name of the kernel configuration.

Each device driver in the kernel displays a line or two.  The
particular disk I'm using (the "bare.i" bootdisk) displays more than
one screen's worth.  It is possible to type shift-page up to scroll
the text back.  On my machine, the boot messages are as follows:

Welcome to the Slackware Linux installation disk ,version 3.1.0-text!
### READ THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW CAREFULLY! ###

You will need one or more partitions of type "Linux native"
prepared. It is also recommended that you create a swap partition
(type "Linux swap") prior to installation. Most users can use the
Linux "fdisk" utility to create and tag the types of all these
partitions. OS/2 Boot Manager users, however, should create their
Linux partitions with OS/2 "fdisk", add the bootable (root) partition
to the Boot Manager menu, and then use the Linux "fdisk" to tag the
partitions as type "Linux native".

If you have 4 megabytes or less of RAM, you MUST ACTIVATE a swap
partition before running setup. After making the partition with fdisk,
use:

mkswap /dev/<partition> <number of blocks> ; swapon /dev/<partition>

Once you have prepared the disk partitions for Linux, type "setup" to
begin the installation process.

You may now login as "root".

slackware login:
</verb></tscreen><verb>
-- end quote
</verb>

The program that prints the login prompt is called <tt/agetty/.  The
Slackware 3.1 root disks are set up to allow logins only from the
computer's own keyboard.  You will have to reconfigure it to also
allow logins from a serial port.  This requires typing four lines on
the Linux machine keyboard, with no voice feedback.  If you realize
you have made a mistake before hitting the carriage return, you can
erase it with the backspace key.  You can also discard what you have
typed on a line with control-C.  Here is what you type:

<tscreen><verb>
root
cat >>/etc/inittab
s1:45:respawn:/sbin/agetty 9600 ttyS0
control-D
init q
</verb></tscreen>

I will repeat that with explanations of what is going on.

First, type "root" and a single carriage return
to log in (no password is needed).  Next, you need to append one line
to <tt>/etc/inittab</tt>.  Type the following two lines:

<tscreen><verb>
cat >>/etc/inittab
s1:45:respawn:/sbin/agetty 9600 ttyS0
</verb></tscreen>

Finish each line with the "enter" key.  Then type a control-D, which
signals end of file to a Unix program.  (Note: In the second line, the
next to last character is an upper case "S".  Everything else is in
lower case.)  This adds a line to the configuration file
of the program <tt/init/, to instruct it to use <tt/agetty/ to watch
for logins on the first serial port on the Linux machine, called
"COM1" under DOS, or "/dev/ttyS0" under Linux.  To use the second port
instead, change the last item on the above line to "ttyS1".

Then type

<tscreen><verb>
init q
</verb></tscreen>

which causes <tt/init/ to reread <tt>/etc/inittab</tt>.  At
this point the DOS machine should display the login prompt (the third
of the blocks of text quoted above).  On the DOS machine, type
<tt/root/, and finish the installation.  (The next thing you should do
is create and enable a swap partition.)

If you don't get the Slackware installation disk prompt, try the
following:
<itemize>
<item> Type a single carriage return on the DOS machine.  
<item> Recheck the terminal setup (9600 baud, no parity, eight data
bits, 1 stop bit)
<item> Disconnect the null modem from the DOS machine.  In its place,
connect a modem which supports the Hayes "AT" commands.  Type <tt/AT/ and
a carriage return.  You should get a reply of "OK" from the modem.
</itemize>

Once you get the above prompt on the DOS machine, you may type
<tt/root/ and a carriage return to log in, and complete the
installation like any other user.  Of course, you must remember to
include these packages: emacs, tcl, and tclX.

The installation script will offer to prepare a boot floppy.  You
should do this, since it is the most foolproof way to boot Linux.  You
will probably also want to install <tt/lilo/ (which is an abbreviation
for "Linux loader") and/or <tt/loadlin/ (which is an abbreviation for
"load Linux").  The installation script can install lilo.  Loadlin is
a DOS program that will let you boot from DOS to Linux.  Install it on
a DOS partition, and copy a compressed kernel file (usually named
<tt/zImage/) to the same partition.  While running DOS, you may boot
Linux with a command like <tt>loadlin zimage root=/dev/hda3 ro/</tt>.
(I have assumed here that the kernel image is in the same directory as
the loadlin program.  You may find it more convenient to store kernel
images in subdirectories named for the kernel version.)

After the Slackware setup script finishes the main installation, it
will tell you to restart by pressing cntl-alt-del.  Before doing that,
you should install emacspeak.  It can be found with the other
"contributed" software.  In the InfoMagic set, it is in
slackwar/contrib.  Assuming you are installing Linux directly from a
CDROM, the setup script will mount the CDROM under /CDROM, and you may
install emacspeak with the following command:

<tscreen><verb>
	# installpkg /CDROM/slackwar/contrib/emacspeak.tgz
</verb></tscreen>

If you install from floppies, insert the floppy you made earlier and
type this:
<tscreen><verb>
	# mount -tmsdos /dev/fd0 /floppy
	# cp /floppy/emacspea.tgz /tmp/emacspeak.tgz
	# installpkg /tmp/emacspeak.tgz
</verb></tscreen>

You should not install the package directly off the floppy disk,
because the DOS filesystem will not allow the full filename, so the
installpkg program will think the package name is "emacspea" and will
store its records under that name.

If you have a DoubleTalk or LiteTalk speech synthesizer, you should
also install the emacspeak-dt package.

Reboot the Linux machine with the new boot floppy, with the
DOS machine still connected.  You should get a login prompt on the DOS
machine.  Celebrate!  After getting this system working, you need to
learn emacs (third option) and Unix system administration.

<sect1>Learning Unix System Administration<label id="sysadm">
<p>

Mostly you will learn system administration as the need arises.  First
adding a user (yourself), then installing programs, and so forth.  The
exception to this is making backups, which you should learn
<bf/before/ you need them.

Among the many programs you will need to learn are these:
<descrip>
<tag/adduser/ Register a new user, including creating a home directory
and adding an entry in /etc/passwd.

<tag/tar/ Create and unpack <tt/.tar/ files, which are collections of
files (something like <tt/.zip/ files).  To list the contents of an
archive, use <tt/tar -tf foobar.tar/.  For a more verbose listing, use
<tt/tar -tvf foobar.tar/.  To unpack an archive, use <tt/tar -xf
foobar.tar/.

<tag/chmod/ Change permissions of a file or directory.

<tag/chown/ Change ownership of a file or directory.

<tag/find/ Search directories recursively.  For example, the command
<tt/find . -name '*alpha*' -print/ means: search starting in the
current directory (<tt/./) for a file whose name contains the string
"alpha" (<tt/-name '*alpha*'/), and print its path and name
(<tt/-print/).  (With GNU find, the <tt/-print/ is optional.)

<tag/du/ Display the amount of space occupied by files or
subdirectories.  For a file with "holes", this may be much less than
the length of the file.

<tag/df/ Display filesystem capacities, free space, and where they
are mounted.

<tag/mount/ Display filesystems, where they are mounted, and the mount
flags.

<tag/ifconfig/ Configure and check internet protocol (IP) network
interfaces, including Ethernet cards, SLIP links, and PLIP links.

<tag/route/ Configure and check IP network routing, after the
interface is configured.

<tag/ping/ Check IP network connectivity, after the interfaces and
routes are configured.

<tag/ftp/ Transfer files across the Internet.

</descrip>

Here are some programs you may want to install:
<descrip>
<tag/agrep/ Approximate grep searches for approximate, not exact, string 
matches (also called "fuzzy string searches").

<tag/archie/ Search Internet archives for files.

<tag/flip/ Convert text files between Unix and DOS formats.

<tag/glimpse/ Fuzzy string searches in large collection of files (uses agrep).

<tag/lynx/ Text mode web browser.
</descrip>

<sect>Stage 4. Emacspeak under Linux
<p>

The Slackware setup script for Emacspeak should create the needed
environment variables and install a script <tt/emacspeak/ that starts
emacs with emacspeak.  This is your fourth option for learning Emacs.
This is the first time you will be able to actually use Emacspeak.  A
short tutorial appears below.  Within Emacs, you may type C-h C-e to
get a list of the commands.  To search for a command, use C-h a.  To
get an explanation for a key sequence, use C-h k.  There is also an
info file which is part of the Emacspeak distribution.  Within emacs,
you may type C-h i to open the directory to the info pages.  Search
for the emacspeak menu item by typing C-s emacspeak, then two carriage
returns (one to terminate the search, and a second one to go to the
info page).  If you have the standalone info program installed, you can
consult the info file with the command <tt/info Emacspeak/.

<sect1>Emacspeak Introduction - Speech Enabled Normal Commands
<p>
All of the normal Emacs movement commands will speak the relevant
information after moving.  Here are some of the cursor movement
functions that have  been speech enabled.  Note that this list only
enumerates a few of these speech enabled commands; the purpose of
emacspeak is to speech-enable all of emacs and provide you spoken
feedback as you work.  Thus, this list is here only as a
representative example of the kind of speech-enabling extensions
Emacspeak  provides.

<descrip>
<tag/
`C-n' or
`M-x next-line' or
`down'/
     Moves the cursor to the next line and speaks it.

<tag/
`C-p' or
`M-x previous-line' or
`up'/
     Moves the cursor to the previous line and speaks it.

<tag/
`M-f' or
`M-x forward-word' or/
     Moves the cursor to the next word and speaks it.
     Places point on the first character of
     the next work, rather than on the space preceding it (This is my
     personal preference).

<tag/
`M-b' or
`M-x backward-word'/
     Moves the cursor to the previous word and speaks it.

<tag/
`M-C-b' or
`M-x backward-sexp'/
     Moves the cursor to the previous sexp and speaks it.  If the sexp
     spans more than a line, only the first line is spoken.

<tag/
`M-&lt;' or
`M-x beginning-of-buffer'/
     Speaks line moved to.

<tag/
`M-&gt;' or
`M-x end-of-buffer'/
     Speaks line moved to.

<tag/
`M-m' or
`M-x back-to-indentation'/
     Speaks entire current line.  A useful way of hearing the current
     line.
</descrip>

<sect1>Emacspeak Introduction - New Commands
<p>
Emacspeak provides a number of commands for reading
portions of the current buffer, getting status information, and
modifying Emacspeak's state.

All of the commands are documented in the subsequent sections.
They can be classified into types:

The first group of commands are for listening to chunks of
information.  The names of these commands all start with the common
prefix `emacspeak-'.  All Emacspeak commands are bound to the keymap
EMACSPEAK-KEYMAP and are accessed with the key `Control e'.  Thus, the
Emacspeak command "emacspeak-speak-line" is bound to `l' in keymap
EMACSPEAK-KEYMAP and can be accessed with the keystroke `Control-e l'.

Here are some of the commands for reading text:

<descrip>
<tag/
`C-e c' or
`M-x emacspeak-speak-char'/
Speak current character, using the phonetic alphabet.

<tag/
`C-e w' or
`M-x emacspeak-speak-word'/
Speak current word.

<tag/
`C-e l' or
`M-x emacspeak-speak-line'/
Speak current line.  With prefix `C-u', speaks the rest of the line from
point.  With negative prefix `C-u -', speaks from start of line to
point.  Voicifies if voice-lock-mode is on.  Indicates indentation
with a tone if audio indentation is in use.  Indicates position of
point with an aural highlight if option emacspeak-show-point is turned
on --see command `M-x emacspeak-show-point'.

<tag/
`C-e .' or
`M-x emacspeak-speak-sentence'/
Speak the current sentence.
</descrip>

The second category of commands provided by Emacspeak report status of
various kinds.

<descrip>
<tag/
`C-e k' or
`M-x emacspeak-speak-current-kill'/
Speak the current kill entry (which would be yanked by the next C-y).

<tag/
`C-e =' or
`M-x emacspeak-speak-current-column'/
State the column where point is.

<tag/
`C-e C-l' or
`M-x emacspeak-speak-line-number'/
State the line where point is.

<tag/
`C-e m' or `M-x emacspeak-speak-line-number'/
Speak the mode-line: the name of the buffer, how far point is into the
current buffer as a percentage, and the major mode.

<tag/
`C-e M' or `M-x emacspeak-speak-minor-mode-line'/
Speak the minor modes that are in effect.

<tag/
`C-e v' or `M-x emacspeak-speak-version'/
Announce the emacspeak version.
</descrip>

The third category of commands provided by Emacspeak manipulate the
state of the speech device.  The names of these commands start with
the common prefix `dtk-'.  Many of these commands take the
prefix `Control-e d'.  Thus, the command "dtk-set-rate" is bound to
`r' in keymap EMACSPEAK-DTK-SUBMAP and can be executed by pressing
`Control e d r'.

<descrip>
<tag/
`C-e s' or
`M-x dtk-stop'/
Stop speech now.  In addition, any command that causes speech output will
discard anything in the speech buffer.  

<tag/
`C-e d V' or `M-x emacspeak-dtk-speak-version'/
Use this to find out which version of the Dectalk firmware you have.

<tag/
`C-e d I' or `M-x dtk-toggle-stop-immediately-while-typing'/
Toggle state of variable dtk-stop-immediately-while-typing.
As the name implies, if true then speech flushes immediately as you type.

<tag/
`C-e d i' or `M-x emacspeak-toggle-audio-indentation'/
Toggle state of Emacspeak audio indentation.  Specifying the method of
indentation as `tone' results in the DECtalk producing a tone whose
length is a function of the line's indentation. Specifying `speak'
results in the number of initial spaces being spoken.

<tag/
`C-e d k' or `M-x emacspeak-toggle-character-echo'/
Toggle state of  Emacspeak  character echo (that is, whether typed
characters are echoed).

<tag/
`C-e d w' or `M-x emacspeak-toggle-word-echo'/
Toggle state of  Emacspeak  word echo (initially on).

<tag/
`C-e d l' or `M-x emacspeak-toggle-line-echo'/
Toggle state of  Emacspeak  line echo (that is, whether typed text is
echoed after typing enter).

<tag/
`C-e d p' or `M-x dtk-set-punctuations'/
Set punctuation state. Possible values are `some', `all', or `none'.

<tag/
`C-e d q' or `M-x dtk-toggle-quiet'/
Toggle state of the speech device between being quiet and talkative.
Useful if you want to continue using an emacs session that has
emacspeak loaded but wish to make the speech shut up.

<tag/
`C-e d R' or `M-x dtk-reset-state'/
Restore sanity to the Dectalk.
Typically used after the Dectalk has been power cycled.

<tag/
`C-e d SPC' or `M-x dtk-toggle-splitting-on-white-space'/
Toggle state of emacspeak that decides if we split text
purely by clause boundaries, or also include whitespace.

<tag/
`C-e d r' or `M-x dtk-set-rate'/
Set speaking rate for the dectalk.

<tag/
`C-e d s' or `M-x dtk-toggle-split-caps'/
Toggle split caps mode.  In split caps mode, a transition from lower
case to upper case is treated like the beginning of a new word.  This
is useful when reading Hungarian notation in program source code.

<tag/
`C-e d v' or `M-x voice-lock-mode'/
Toggle Voice Lock mode (initially off).
When Voice Lock mode is enabled, text is voiceified as you type it, as
follows: 
<itemize>
<item>Comments are spoken in <tt/voice-lock-comment-personality/;
(That is a variable whose value should be a personality name.)
<item>Strings are spoken in <tt/voice-lock-string-personality/.
<item>Documentation strings are spoken in
<tt/voice-lock-doc-string-personality/.

<sect1>Emacspeak Introduction - Using the Help System
<p>

When you press C-h to get the help index, the screen will appear, but
Emacspeak will not speak the window.  The only thing spoken is "Type
one of the options listed or Space to scroll:".

Here is the menu that Emacspeak is not speaking:

<verb>
-- begin quote
</verb><tscreen><verb>

You have typed C-h, the help character.  Type a Help option:
(Use SPC or DEL to scroll through this text.  Type q to exit the Help
command.)

a  command-apropos.  Give a substring, and see a list of commands
        (functions interactively callable) that contain
        that substring.  See also the  apropos  command.
b  describe-bindings.  Display table of all key bindings.
c  describe-key-briefly.  Type a command key sequence;
        it prints the function name that sequence runs.
f  describe-function.  Type a function name and get documentation of
it.
C-f Info-goto-emacs-command-node.  Type a function name;
        it takes you to the Info node for that command.
F  view-emacs-FAQ.  Shows emacs frequently asked questions file.
i  info. The  info  documentation reader.
k  describe-key.  Type a command key sequence;
        it displays the full documentation.
C-k Info-goto-emacs-key-command-node.  Type a command key sequence;
        it takes you to the Info node for the command bound to that
key.
l  view-lossage.  Shows last 100 characters you typed.
m  describe-mode.  Print documentation of current major mode,
        which describes the commands peculiar to it.
n  view-emacs-news.  Shows emacs news file.
p  finder-by-keyword. Find packages matching a given topic keyword.
s  describe-syntax.  Display contents of syntax table, plus
explanations
t  help-with-tutorial.  Select the Emacs learn-by-doing tutorial.
v  describe-variable.  Type name of a variable;
        it displays the variable's documentation and value.
w  where-is.  Type command name; it prints which keystrokes
        invoke that command.
C-c print Emacs copying permission (General Public License).
C-d print Emacs ordering information.
C-n print news of recent Emacs changes.
C-p print information about the GNU project.
C-w print information on absence of warranty for GNU Emacs.

</verb></tscreen><verb>
-- end quote
</verb>

Suppose you type "a", for command-apropos.

The next spoken prompt is "Apropos command (regexp):"

Now you type some word you think is part of an emacs command, like
"visit".

The help system will display the first section of the help, but will
leave the cursor in the other window.  The spoken text is "Type C-x 1
to remove help window.  M-C-v to scroll the help."  At this point, I
think it's more helpful to move point to the other window with C-x o,
then you can use regular navigation commands to speak the help text.
You can delete the help window with C-x 0, which will also put point
back where it was.

The complete menu displayed by help-for-help is also visible if you do
a describe function on help-for-help.  In a future version of
Emacspeak, Raman plans to add a message to that effect when the user
presses C-h ?

<sect1>Emacs for DOS<label id="dos-emacs"> 
<p>
From the Emacs FAQ of November 11, 1996:
<verb>
--begin quote
</verb>
93:  Where can I get Emacs for my PC running MS-DOS?

  A pre-built binary distribution of Emacs 19.34 should be available
  by the beginning of November 1996 from the Simtel archives, the main
  site of which is at

        <url url="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu/">

  If you prefer to compile Emacs for yourself, you will need a 386 (or
  better) processor, and are running MS-DOS 3.0 or later.  According
  to Eli Zaretskii <tt/eliz@is.elta.co.il/ and Darrel Hankerson
  <tt/hankedr@dms.auburn.edu/, you will need the following:

  Compiler: djgpp version 1.12 maint 1 or later.  Djgpp 2.0 or later is
            recommended, since 1.x is being phased out.  Djgpp 2 supports
            long filenames under Windows 95.

            You can get the latest release of djgpp by retrieving
            all of the files in

              <url url="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp">

  Gunzip and tar:

            The easiest way is to use "djtar" which comes with djgpp
            v2.x, because it can open gzip'ed tarfiles (i.e., those
            ending with ".tar.gz") in one step.  Djtar comes in
            "djdev201.zip", from the URL mentioned above.

  Utilities: make, mv, sed, rm.  

            All of these utilities are available at

               <url url="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu">

            16-bit utilities can be found in GNUish:

              <url url="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/gnuish">

  The file INSTALL in the top-level directory of the Emacs source
  contains some additional information regarding Emacs under MS-DOS.
  In addition, the file etc/MSDOS contains some information on the
  differences between the Unix and MS-DOS versions of Emacs.

  For the most comprehensive information on running GNU Emacs on a PC,
  see the file prepared by Michael Ernst
  <tt/mernst@theory.lcs.mit.edu/ at

    <url url="ftp://theory.lcs.mit.edu/pub/emacs/pc-emacs.gz">

  For a list of other MS-DOS implementations of Emacs (and Emacs
  look-alikes), consult the list of "Emacs implementations and
  literature," available at

    <url url="ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/comp.emacs/">

  Note that while many of these programs look similar to Emacs, they
  often lack certain features, such as the Emacs Lisp extension
  language.

<sect>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<sect1>Why does it say "space" after each character?
<p>
Your <idx>DECtalk Express</idx> has old firmware.  Use the Emacspeak
command `C-e d V' to find out your version.  You should be running a
version no older than 4.2bw from March 1995.  If you have an earlier
version, you can find an updated version at <url
url="http://www.ultranet.com/~rongemma/tips&lowbar;upd.htm">, a WWW
site maintained by Ron Jemma of the Dectalk Group at DEC.
Alternatively, you can send email to Anne Nelson at
DEC<tt/nelson@dectlk.enet.dec.com/.  The most recent version at this
writing is 4.3 release AA X01 May 20 1996.

<sect1 >Why the high pitched tone from a DECtalk?
<p>
On occasion when reading the DECtalk will produce high pitch
tones that last for several words or more, if this happens in a buffer
it will often repeat within the same buffer.
<p>
The problem is due to remaining bugs in the Dectalk firmware.  When
emacspeak produces tones, especially when split caps is on, the dtk
sometime goes into squealing mode.

If you notice this happening in particular text documents, just turn
off split caps mode locally with `C-e d s'.


<sect1>Why the "No library autorevert in search path" message?
<p>
What is the significance of the message "No library autorevert in
search path" which is spoken (or at least queued for speech) when
emacspeak 7.0 starts?
<p>
It's completely insignificant. autorevert is a new minor
mode provided by emacs 20 and emacspeak looks for it and if
found speech-enables it.

<sect1>How do I change Emacspeak defaults?
<p>
What is the best way to change Emacspeak defaults for things
such as speech rate, default punctuation mode, etc.?
<p>
Just put the needed changes in your .emacs file.  ".emacs" is a file
in your home directory that is loaded by emacs when it starts (shortly
after reading emacspeak).  It is the place to do personal
modifications.

Here is an example which resets the speech rate and character scale,
enables auditory icons, disables character echo and split caps mode,
and redefines a function (courtesy of Greg Priest-Dorman
priestdo@cs.vassar.edu and Matt Campbell mattcamp@feist.com):

<tscreen><verb>
	;;
	(dtk-set-rate 380 t)
	(emacspeak-toggle-auditory-icons t)
	(dtk-set-character-scale 1.05 t)
	(emacspeak-toggle-character-echo t)
	(dtk-toggle-split-caps t)
	;;
	(defun emacspeak-speak-time ()
	  "Speak the time. "
	  (interactive)
	  (dtk-speak  (format-time-string "%A %B %e, %I %M %p" 
	      (current-time) )))
	;;
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>What if an error message is not spoken?
<p>
An error message was displayed on the screen, but not reported by
Emacspeak
<p>
In general, if emacs hits an error and you don't get to hear
the message because it went by too quickly, here is what you
should do:

1) Switch to the *Messages* buffer and see if you see the
message there. 99% of the time it will be there.

2) If some portion of emacs or an emacs application throws
an error without leaving an appropriate message in the
*Messages* buffer,
then turn on emacs' debugging 
facility by 
`M-x set-variable ret'
`debug-on-error ret'
`t ret'
this sets debugon-on-error to true now repeat what caused the error
you will be placed in a backtrace buffer.

Warning: do not read the entire contents of the backtrace
buffer at one shot with emacspeak.  Go line by line.

<sect1>The terminal emulator is the most problematic portion of Emacspeak.
<p>
It's not an emacspeak problem-- it's a terminal problem.  Getting a
terminal emulator working correctly inside emacs is not a joke-- and
eterm is an excellent piece of work, but depending on how some old app
behaves you will (or should always expect to) see some weirdness.

After all, remember all of these UNIX terminal apps work
from all kinds of terminals ranging from vt52's to new devices.

<sect1>In a term buffer, the first half screen is not spoken
<p> 
When starting a term buffer, no output is spoken in line mode by
Emacspeak until the cursor has made it about half way down the screen
<p>
I've not seen this-- and I am running emacs 20.

When you start term it is in character mode.
When you switch to line mode make sure the cursor is at the
end of the buffer--
otherwise what you send will never go to the shell.

Also, in general use M-x shell (comint-mode) for running things you
would run in line mode in eterm-- it's been around longer and far more
robust. M-x term specializes in its character-mode of terminal
emulation and may not always take care of everything in line mode.

<sect1>Term mode gets flaky after a long session.
<p>
Sometimes, after long sessions with a term buffer, I will experience
similar problems as do you with spech in the term becoming very flaky.
Output may or may not be spoken (I have not determined the pattern).
<p>
if the term becomes flaky, enter character mode and issue a reset.
the above is usually a result of running some curses based app that
leaves the terminal in a screwy state.
<p>
Many curses based apps follow slightly different conventions on where
they leave the cursor while you edit-- 60-70% of them leave the cursor
just after the character you typed with a null character after point.
Others leave a space character there which is what you hear.
<p>
Experiment between setting TERM to vt100 and eterm.
Depending on whether the app was linked against curses or
ncurses (former uses TERMCAP and latter uses TERMINFO)
you will get different results.
