<title>The Linux Kernel HOWTO
<author>Brian Ward, <tt>bri@cs.uchicago.edu</tt>
<date>v2.4, 26 Mar 2001

<abstract>
This is a detailed guide to kernel configuration, compilation, upgrades,
and troubleshooting for ix86-based systems.
</abstract>

<toc>

<sect> Introduction <p>

Should you read this document? Well, see if you've got any of the following
symptoms:
<p>

<itemize>
<item> ``Arg! This wizzo-46.5.6 package says it needs kernel
release 2.8.193 and I still only have release 1.0.9!''
<item> There's a device driver in one of the newer kernels that
you just gotta have
<item> You really have no idea at all how to compile a kernel
<item> ``Is this stuff in the README <it>really</it> the whole story?''
<item> You came, you tried, it didn't work
<item> You need something to give to people who insist on asking you to
install their kernels for them
</itemize>

<sect1> Read this first! (I mean it)<p>
Some of the examples in this document assume that you have GNU <tt>tar</tt>,
<tt>find</tt>, and <tt>xargs</tt>. These are quite standard; this should
not cause problems. It is also assumed that
you know your system's filesystem structure; if you don't, it is critical
that you keep a written copy of the <tt>mount</tt> command's output during
normal system operation (or a listing of <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>, if you can
read it). This information is important, and does not change unless you
repartition your disk, add a new one, reinstall your system, or something
similar.<p>

The latest ``production'' kernel version at the time of this writing was
2.2.9, meaning that the references and examples correspond to that
release. Even though I try to make this document as version-independent as
possible, the kernel is constantly under development, so if you get a
newer release, it will inevitably have some differences. Again, this should
not cause major problems, but it may create some confusion.<p>

There are two versions of the linux kernel source, ``production'' and
``development.'' Production releases are the even-minor-numbered releases;
1.2.x was production, 2.0.x is production, as well as 2.2.x. These kernels
are considered to be the
most stable, bug-free versions available at the time of release. The
development kernels (2.1.x, 2.3.x, etc) are meant as testing kernels, for
people willing to test out new and possibly very buggy kernels. You have
been warned.<p>

<sect1>A word on style<p>
<tt>Text that looks like this</tt> is either something that appears on
your screen, a filename, or something that can be directly typed in, such as a
command, or options to a command (if you're looking
at a plain-text file, it doesn't look any different). Commands and other
input are frequently quoted (with ` '), which causes the following
classic punctuation problem: if such an item appears at the end of a sentence
in quotes, people often type a `.' along with the command, because the
American quoting style says to put the period inside of the quotation
marks. Even though common sense (and unfortunately, this assumes that the
one with the ``common sense'' is used to the so-called American style of
quotation) should tell one to strip off the
punctuation first, many people simply do not remember, so I will place
it outside the quotation marks in such cases. In other words, when
indicating that you should type ``<tt>make config</tt>'' I would write 
`<tt>make config</tt>', not `<tt>make config</tt>.'

These sites have <bf>lots of linux goodies</bf> and tips.

A copy of the above web-site is reproduced here -

Kernel re-compile is required in order to make the kernel very lean 
and which will result in FASTER operating system . It is also
required to support any new devices. 
<bf>Note: </bf> Below 'bash#' denotes the bash prompt, you should type
the commands that appear after the 'bash#' prompt. Below are commands 
tested on Redhat Linux, but it should work for other distributions with
very minor changes.
 
<enum>
<item> Login in as 'root' throughout all these steps. Mount Redhat linux cdrom and install the linux kernel source rpm 
<code>
bash$ su - root
bash# cd /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS 
bash# rpm -i    kernel-headers*.rpm 
bash# rpm -i    kernel-sources*.rpm 
bash# rpm -i dev86*.rpm   
bash# rpm -i bin86*.rpm   
</code>
(The bin86*.rpm and 'as86' is required only for <bf>OLDER Linux</bf> systems like redhat 5.x. 
Get Intel assembler 'as86' command from  
dev86*.rpm on cdrom or from
<url url="http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/mandrake/7.1/Mandrake/RPMS/bin86-0.4-12mdk.i586.html">
, <url url="http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/kondara/jirai/i586/bin86-0.4-8k.i586.html">
).
<p>

<item> Start X-windows with 'startx'. 
<code>
bash# man startx
bash# startx
bash# cd /usr/src/linux 
bash# make xconfig 
</code>
The <bf>"make xconfig"</bf> brings up a user friendly GUI interface! <bf>DO NOT</bf>
use 'make config' which is a command-line option (
use this only if you <bf>CANNOT</bf> bring up X-window). You can load 
the configuration file from  <it>/usr/src/linux/.config</it> (dot config file).
<p>

<item> Enable the Loadable kernel modules support! 
With this option you can load/unload the device drivers 
dynamically on running linux system on the fly.
See these man pages 
<code>
bash# man lsmod
bash# man insmod
bash# man rmmod
bash# man depmod
</code>
<p>

<item> Save and Exit "make xconfig". 
All the options which you selected is now saved into configuration file
at <it>/usr/src/linux/.config</it> (dot config file).
And now, do - 
<code>
bash# make dep
bash# make clean
</code>
<p>

<item> Read the following file (to gain some knowledge about kernel building. Tip: Use
the color editor
<url name="gvim" url="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Vim-HOWTO.html">
for better readability.
<code>
bash# gvim -R   /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/config.in 
bash# man less 
bash# less   /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/config.in 
Type 'h' for help and to navigate press i, j, k, l, h or arrow, page up/down keys. 
</code>
<p>

<item> Now, give the make command - 
<code>
	bash# cd /usr/src/linux
	bash# man nohup
	bash# nohup make bzImage &  
	bash# tail -f nohup.out     (.... to monitor the progress) 
This will put the kernel in /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage 
	bash# man tail 
</code>
<p>

<item> After bzImage is successful, copy the kernel image to /boot directory.
You must copy the new kernel image to /boot directory, otherwise the 
new kernel <bf>may not</bf> boot. 
And then read the manual page on lilo 
(see also <url url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/LILO-crash-rescue-HOWTO.html">)
and see the <ref id="liloconf" name="sample lilo.conf"> file.
Always give a date extension to the filename as below:
<code>
bash# cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage     /boot/bzImage.myker.26mar2001
bash# man lilo
bash# man lilo.conf
And edit /etc/lilo.conf file and put these lines - 
	image=/boot/bzImage.myker.26mar2001 
	label=myker
	root=/dev/hda1 
	read-only 
You can check device name for 'root=' with the command - 
	bash# df   /boot 
</code>
<p>

<item> Now give 
<code>
bash# lilo 
bash# lilo -q 
</code>
You must re-run lilo even if entry 'myker' exists, everytime you create a new bzImage. 
<p>

<item> Reboot the machine and at lilo press tab key and 
type 'myker' If it boots then you did a good job! Otherwise at lilo 
select your old kernel, boot and re-try all over again. Your old kernel 
<bf>is still INTACT and SAFE</bf> at say <it>/boot/vmlinuz-2.0.34-0.6</it>
<p>

<item> Loadable Modules: 
Check for insmod command which is extensively used for loading the modules.
<code>
bash# man insmod
bash# insmod 
bash# rpm -i /mnt/cdrom/Redhat/RPMS/modutils*.rpm
</code>

The step given below may not be required but is needed <bf>only for emergencies</bf> where
your /lib/modules files are damaged. If you already have 
the /lib/modules directory and in case you 
want replace them use the --force to replace the package and 
select appropriate cpu architecture.

For new versions of linux redhat linux 6.0 and later, the kernel modules are
included with kernel-2.2*.rpm. Install the loadable modules and the kernel with
<code>
	This will list the already installed package.
bash# rpm -qa | grep -i kernel
	
bash# rpm -U --force  /mnt/cdrom/Redhat/RPMS/kernel-2.2.14-5.0.i686.rpm
(or)
bash# rpm -U --force  /mnt/cdrom/Redhat/RPMS/kernel-2.2.14-5.0.i586.rpm
(or)
bash# rpm -U --force  /mnt/cdrom/Redhat/RPMS/kernel-2.2.14-5.0.i386.rpm
</code>

This is only for old versions of redhat linux 5.2 and before.
Boot new kernel and install the loadable 
modules from RedHat Linux "contrib" cdrom 
<code>
bash# rpm -i /mnt/cdrom/contrib/kernel-modules*.rpm 
....(For old linux systems which do not have insmod pre-installed) 
</code>
<p>

<item> This step is required <bf>ONLY if you had downloaded a new 
version</bf> of linux kernel source.
Loadable module are located in /lib/modules. 
<code>
bash# cd /usr/src/linux
bash# make modules
bash# make modules_install
</code>
<p>

<item> If your new kernel 'myker' boots and works properly, you can create the 
boot disk. Insert a blank floppy into floppy drive and - 
<code>
bash# cd /usr/src/linux
bash# make bzdisk
See also mkbootdisk -
bash# rpm -i mkbootdisk*.rpm
bash# man mkbootdisk
</code>
</enum>

<sect1> Troublshoot Common Mistakes
<p>
The following mistake is commited very frequently by new users.

If your new kernel does not boot and you get -
<code>
Warning: unable to open an initial console
Kernel panic: no init found. Try passing init= option to kernel
</code>
The problem is that you <bf>did not</bf> set the "root=" parameter properly
in the /etc/lilo.conf. In my case, I used root=/dev/hda1 which is
having the root partition "/". You must properly point the root device in your
lilo.conf, it can be like /dev/hdb2 or /dev/hda7.

The kernel looks for the init command which is located in /sbin/init.
And /sbin directory lives on the root partition.
For details see -
<code>
bash# man init
</code>

<sect1> Sample lilo.conf <label id="liloconf">
<p>
Given below is a sample /etc/lilo.conf file. You should follow the 
naming conventions like ker2217 (for kernel 2.2.17), ker2214 (for kernel 2.2.14).
You can have many kernel images on the same /boot system.
On my machine I have something like:
<code>
boot=/dev/hda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
default=firewall

image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.14-5.0
	label=ker2214
	read-only
	root=/dev/hda9

image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.17-14
	label=ker2217
	read-only
	root=/dev/hda9

#image=/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage 
#	label=myker 
#	root=/dev/hda7
#	read-only 

image=/boot/bzImage.myker.11feb2001
	label=myker11feb 
	root=/dev/hda9
	read-only 

image=/boot/bzImage.myker.01jan2001
	label=myker01jan 
	root=/dev/hda9
	read-only 

image=/boot/bzImage.myker-firewall.16mar2001
	label=firewall 
	root=/dev/hda9
	read-only 
</code>

<sect>Important questions and their answers <p>

<sect1>What does the kernel do, anyway? <p>

The Unix kernel acts as a mediator for your programs and your hardware.
First, it does (or arranges for) the memory management for all of the
running programs (processes), and makes sure that they all get a fair (or
unfair, if you please) share of the processor's cycles. In addition, it
provides a nice, fairly portable interface for programs to talk to your
hardware.
<p>

There is certainly more to the kernel's operation than this, but these
basic functions are the most important to know.
<p>

<sect1>Why would I want to upgrade my kernel? <p>

Newer kernels generally offer the ability to talk to more types of
hardware (that is, they have more device drivers), they can have better
process management, they can run faster than the older versions, they
could be more stable than the older versions, and they fix silly bugs in
the older versions. Most people upgrade kernels because they want the
device drivers and the bug fixes.
<p>

<sect1>What kind of hardware do the newer kernels support? <p>

See the Hardware-HOWTO. Alternatively, you can look at the
`<tt>config.in</tt>' file in the linux source, or just find out
when you try `<tt>make config</tt>'.
This shows you all hardware supported by the
standard kernel distribution, but not everything that linux supports; many
common device drivers (such as the PCMCIA drivers and some tape drivers) are
loadable modules maintained and distributed separately.
<p>

<sect1>What version of gcc and libc do I need? <p>

Linus recommends a version of gcc in the <tt>README</tt> file included with
the linux source. If you don't have this version, the documentation in the
recommended version of gcc should tell you if you need to upgrade your libc.
This is not a difficult procedure, but it is important to follow the
instructions.
<p>

<sect1>What's a loadable module? <p>

These are pieces of kernel code which are not
linked (included) directly in the kernel. One compiles them separately,
and can insert and remove them into the running kernel at almost any
time. Due to its flexibility, this is now the preferred way to code certain
kernel features. Many popular device drivers, such as the PCMCIA
drivers and the QIC-80/40 tape driver, are loadable modules.
<p>

<sect1>How much disk space do I need? <p>

It depends on your particular system configuration. First, the compressed
linux source is nearly 14 megabytes large at version 2.2.9. Many sites keep
this even after unpacking.
Uncompressed and built with a moderate configuration, it takes up another 67
MB.
<p>

<sect1>How long does it take? <p>
With newer machines, the compilation takes dramatically less time than
older ones; an AMD K6-2/300 with a fast disk can do a 2.2.x kernel in about
four minutes. As for old Pentiums, 486s, and 386s, if you plan to compile
one, be prepared to wait, possibly hours, days..
<p>
If this troubles you, and you happen to have a faster machine around to
compile on, you can build on the fast machines (assuming you give it the
right parameters, that your ulilities are up-to-date, and so on), and then
transfer the kernel image to the slower machine.
<p>

<sect>How to actually configure the kernel <p>

<sect1>Getting the source <p>

You can obtain the source via anonymous ftp from <tt>ftp.kernel.org</tt> in
<tt>/pub/linux/kernel/vx.y</tt>, where <tt>x.y</tt> is the version (eg 2.2),
and as mentioned before, the ones that end with an odd number are
development releases and may be unstable.
It is typically labelled <tt>linux-x.y.z.tar.gz</tt>, where <tt>x.y.z </tt>
is the version number. The sites also typically carry ones with a suffix of
<tt>.bz2</tt>, which have been compressed with bzip2 (these files will be
smaller and take less time to transfer).
<p>
It's best to use <tt>ftp.xx.kernel.org</tt> where <tt>xx</tt> is your
country code; examples being <tt>ftp.at.kernel.org</tt> for Austria,
and <tt>ftp.us.kernel.org</tt> for the United States.
<p>

<sect1>Unpacking the source <p>

Log in as or <tt>su</tt> to `<tt>root</tt>', and <tt>cd</tt> to
<tt>/usr/src</tt>.
If you installed kernel source when you first installed linux (as most do),
there will already be a directory called `<tt>linux</tt>' there, which
contains the entire old source tree.
If you have the disk space and you want to play it safe, preserve that
directory. A good idea is to figure out
what version your system runs now and rename the directory
accordingly. The command `<tt>uname -r</tt>' prints the current
kernel version.
Therefore, if `<tt>uname -r</tt>' said `<tt>1.0.9</tt>', you would
rename (with `<tt>mv</tt>') `<tt>linux</tt>' to `<tt>linux-1.0.9</tt>'.
If you feel mildly reckless, just wipe out the entire
directory. In any case, make certain there is no `<tt>linux</tt>' directory
in <tt>/usr/src</tt> before unpacking the full source code.
<p>

Now, in <tt>/usr/src</tt>, unpack the source with
`<tt>tar zxpvf linux-x.y.z.tar.gz</tt>'
(if you've just got a <tt>.tar</tt>  file with no <tt>.gz</tt> at the end,
`<tt>tar xpvf linux-x.y.z.tar</tt>' works.).
The contents of the source will fly by. When finished, there will be
a new `<tt>linux</tt>' directory in <tt>/usr/src</tt>. <tt>cd</tt> to
<tt>linux</tt> and look over the <tt>README</tt>  file.
There will be a section with the label `<tt>INSTALLING the kernel</tt>'.
Carry out the instructions when appropriate -- symbolic links that should
be in place, removal of stale <tt>.o</tt> files, etc.
<p>
If you have a <tt>.bz2</tt> file and the bzip2 program (read about it at
<tt>http://www.muraroa.demon.co.uk/</tt>), do this:
<p>
<verb>
     bz2cat linux-x.y.z.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -
</verb>

<sect1>Configuring the kernel <p>

    Note: Some of this is reiteration/clarification of a similar
    section in Linus' <tt>README</tt> file.
<p>

The command `<tt>make config</tt>' while in <tt>/usr/src/linux</tt> starts
a configure script which asks you many questions. It requires bash,
so verify that bash is <tt>/bin/bash</tt>, <tt>/bin/sh</tt>,
or <tt>&dollar;BASH</tt>.
<p>

However, there are some much more pleasant alternatives to `<tt>make
config</tt>' and you may very well find them easier and more comfortable to
use.
`<tt>make menuconfig</tt>' is probably the most widely-used. Whatever you
choose, it's best to get familiar with the interface because you may find
yourself back at it sooner than you think.
For those ``running X,'' you can try `<tt>make xconfig</tt>' if you have Tk
installed (`click-o-rama' - Nat). `<tt>make menuconfig</tt>' is for those
who have
(n)curses and would prefer a text-based menu. These interfaces have a rather
clear advantage: If you goof up and make a
wrong choice during configuration, it is simple to go back and fix it.
<p>

The configuration options will appear in hierarchies with `<tt>make
menuconfig</tt>' and `<tt>make xconfig</tt>'.
<p>

You are ready to answer the questions, usually with `<tt>y</tt>' (yes) or
`<tt>n</tt>' (no). Device drivers typically have an `<tt>m</tt>' option.
This means ``module,'' meaning that the system will compile it, but not
directly into the kernel, but as a loadable module. A more comical way to
describe it is as ``maybe.'' Some of the
more obvious and non-critical options are not described here; see the section
``Other configuration options'' for short descriptions of a few others.
With `<tt>make menuconfig</tt>', the space bar toggles the selection.
<p>

In 2.0.x and later, there is a `?' option, which provides a brief
description of the configuration parameter. That information is likely to
be the most up-to-date. Here are a listing of some of the important
features, which hierarchy they are in, and brief description.
<p>

<sect2>Kernel math emulation (Processor type and features)<p>
If you don't have a math coprocessor (you have a bare 386 or
486SX), you must say `<tt>y</tt>' to this. If you do have a coprocessor and
you still say `<tt>y</tt>', don't worry too much -- the coprocessor is
still used and the emulation ignored. For any halfway modern machine, the
answer will be no, but don't worry if you say yes accidentally; if not
needed, it is not used.
<p>

<sect2>Enhanced (MFM/RLL) disk and IDE disk/cdrom support (Block Devices)<p>

You probably need to support this; it means that the
kernel will support standard PC hard disks, which most
people have. This driver does not include SCSI drives; they come later in
the configuration.
<p>
You will then be asked about the ``old disk-only'' and ``new IDE'' drivers.
You want to choose one of them; the main difference is that the old driver
only supports two disks on a single interface, and the new one supports a
secondary interface and IDE/ATAPI cdrom drives. The new driver is 4k
larger than the old one and is also supposedly ``improved,'' meaning that
aside from containing a different number of bugs, it might improve your
disk performance, especially if you have newer (EIDE-type) hardware.
<p>

<sect2>Networking support (General Setup)<p>

In principle, you would only say `<tt>y</tt>' if your machine is on a network
such as the internet, or you want to use SLIP, PPP, term, etc to
dial up for internet access. However, as many packages (such as the X
window system)
require networking support even if your machine does not live on a real
network, you should say `<tt>y</tt>'. Later on, you will be asked if you
want to support TCP/IP networking; again, say `<tt>y</tt>' here if you
are not absolutely sure.
<p>

<sect2>System V IPC (General Setup)<p>

One of the best definitions of IPC (Interprocess Communication) is in the
Perl book's glossary. Not surprisingly, some Perl programmers employ it to
let processes talk to each other, as well as many other packages (DOOM,
most notably), so it is not a good idea to say <tt>n</tt> unless you know
exactly what you are doing.
<p>

<sect2>Processor family (Processor type and features)<p>
(in older kernels: Use -m486 flag for 486-specific optimizations)<p>

Traditionally, this compiled in certain optimizations for a particular
processor; the kernels ran fine on other chips, but the kernel was perhaps
a bit larger. In newer kernels, however, this is no longer true, so you
should enter the processor for which you are compiling the kernel. A
``386'' kernel will work on all machines.
<p>

<sect2>SCSI support<p>

If you have SCSI devices, say `<tt>y</tt>'. You will be prompted for
further information, such as support for CD-ROM, disks, and what kind
of SCSI adapter you have. See the SCSI-HOWTO for greater detail.
<p>

<sect2>Network device support<p>

If you have a network card, or you would like to use SLIP, PPP, or a
parallel port adapter for connecting to the Internet,
say `<tt>y</tt>'. The config script will prompt
for which kind of card you have, and which protocol to use.
<p>

<sect2>Filesystems<p>

The configure script then asks if you wish to support the following
filesystems:
<p>

Standard (minix) - Newer distributions don't create minix filesystems,
and many people don't use it, but it may still be a good idea to
configure this one. Some ``rescue disk'' programs use it, and still more
floppies may have a minix filesystem, since the minix filesystem is less
painful to use on a floppy.
<p>

Second extended - This is the standard Linux filesystem. You
almost definitely have one of these, and need to say `<tt>y</tt>'.
<p>

msdos - If you want to use your MS-DOS hard disk
partitions, or mount MS-DOS formatted floppy disks, say `<tt>y</tt>'.
<p>

There are various other foreign operating system filesystem types available.
<p>

/proc - (idea from Bell Labs, I guess). One doesn't make a proc
filesystem on a disk; this is a filesystem interface to the kernel and
processes. Many process listers (such as `<tt>ps</tt>') use it. Try
`<tt>cat /proc/meminfo</tt>' or `<tt>cat /proc/devices</tt>' sometime.
Some shells (rc, in particular) use <tt>/proc/self/fd</tt>  (known as
<tt>/dev/fd</tt>
on other systems) for I/O. You should almost certainly say `<tt>y</tt>' to
this; many important linux tools depend on it.
<p>

NFS - If your machine lives on a network and you want to use filesystems which
reside on other systems with NFS, say `<tt>y</tt>'.
<p>

ISO9660 - Found on most CD-ROMs. If you have a CD-ROM drive and you wish to
use it under Linux, say `<tt>y</tt>'.
<p>

<sect3>But I don't know which filesystems I need!
<p>

Ok, type `<tt>mount</tt>'. The output will look something like this:
<p>

<tscreen><verb>
    blah# mount
    /dev/hda1 on / type ext2 (defaults)
    /dev/hda3 on /usr type ext2 (defaults)
    none on /proc type proc (defaults)
    /dev/fd0 on /mnt type msdos (defaults)
</verb></tscreen>

Look at each line; the word next to `<tt>type</tt>' is the filesystem
type. In this example, my <tt>/</tt>  and <tt>/usr</tt> filesystems are
second extended, I'm using <tt>/proc</tt>, and there's a floppy
disk mounted using the msdos (bleah) filesystem.
<p>
You can try `<tt>cat /proc/filesystems</tt>' if you have <tt>/proc</tt>
currently enabled; it will list your current kernel's filesystems.
<p>
The configuration of rarely-used, non-critical filesystems can cause kernel
bloat; see the section on modules for a way to avoid this and the
``Pitfalls'' section on why a bloated kernel is undesirable.
<p>

<sect2>Character devices <p>

Here, you enable the drivers for your printer (parallel printer, that is),
busmouse, PS/2 mouse (many notebooks use the PS/2 mouse protocol for their
built-in trackballs), some tape drives, and other such ``character''
devices. Say `<tt>y</tt>'
when appropriate.
<p>

Note: <tt>gpm</tt> is a program which
allows the use of the mouse outside of the X window system for cut and paste
between virtual consoles. It's fairly nice if you have a serial mouse,
because it coexists well with X, but you need to do special tricks
for others.
<p>

<sect2>Sound<p>

If you feel a great desire to hear <tt>biff</tt> bark, say
`<tt>y</tt>',
and you can tell the configuration program all about your
sound board. (A note on sound card configuration: when it asks you if you
want to install the full version of the driver, you can say `<tt>n</tt>'
and save some kernel memory by picking only the features which you deem
necessary.)
<p>

If you are serious about sound card support, have a look at both the free
drivers at <tt>http://www.linux.org.uk/OSS/</tt> and the commercial
Open Sound System at <tt>http://www.opensound.com/</tt>.
<p>

<sect2>Other configuration options<p>
Not all of the configuration options are listed here because they change
too often or fairly self-evident (for instance, 3Com 3C509 support to
compile the device drive for this particular ethernet card).
There exists a fairly comprehensive list of all the options (plus a way to
place them into the <tt>Configure</tt> script) in an effort started and
maintained by Axel Boldt (<tt>boldt@math.ucsb.edu</tt>) and it's the online
help. It's also available as one big file at the
<tt>Documentation/Configure.help</tt> in your Linux kernel source tree as
of version 2.0.
<p>

<sect2>Kernel hacking <p>

>From Linus' README:

    the ``kernel hacking'' configuration details usually result in
    a bigger or slower kernel (or both), and can even make the
    kernel less stable by configuring some routines to actively try
    to break bad code to find kernel problems (kmalloc()).  Thus
    you should probably answer `n' to the questions for a
    ``production'' kernel. 
<p>

<sect1>Now what? (The Makefile) <p>

After you finish configuration, a message tells you that your kernel has
been configured, and to ``check the top-level <tt>Makefile</tt> for
additional configuration,'' etc.
<p>

So, look at the <tt>Makefile</tt>. You probably will not need to change it,
but it never hurts to look. You can also change its options
with the `<tt>rdev</tt>' command once the new kernel is in place. If you're
feel lost when you look at the file, then don't worry about it.
<p>

<sect>Compiling the kernel <p>

<sect1>Cleaning and depending <p>

When the configure script ends, it also tells you to `<tt>make dep</tt>'
and (possibly) `<tt>clean</tt>'.
So, do the `<tt>make dep</tt>'. This insures that all of the
dependencies, such the include files, are in place. It does not take long,
unless your computer is fairly slow to begin with.
For older versions of the kernel, when finished, you should do a
`<tt>make clean</tt>'.
This removes all of the object files and some other things
that an old version leaves behind. In any case,
<it>do not</it> forget this step before attempting to recompile a kernel.
<p>

<sect1>Compile time <p>

After <tt>dep</tt>ending and <tt>clean</tt>ing, you may now `<tt>make
bzImage</tt>' or `<tt>make bzdisk</tt>' (this is the part that takes a long
time.).
`<tt>make bzImage</tt>' will compile the kernel, and leave
a file in <tt>arch/i386/boot</tt> called `<tt>bzImage</tt>'
(among other things). This is the new compressed kernel. `<tt>make bzdisk</tt>'
does the same thing, but also places the new <tt>bzImage</tt>
on a floppy disk which you hopefully put in drive ``A:''.
`<tt>bzdisk</tt>' is fairly handy for testing new
kernels; if it bombs (or just doesn't work right), just remove the floppy
and boot with
your old kernel. It can also be a handy way to boot if you accidentally
remove your kernel (or something equally as dreadful). You can also use it
to install new systems when you just dump the contents of one disk onto the
other (``all this and more! NOW how much would you pay?'').
<p>

All even halfway reasonably recent kernels are compressed, hence the
`<tt>bz</tt>' in front of the names. A compressed kernel automatically
decompresses itself when executed.
<p>
In older kernels, you don't have the option to build a <tt>bzImage</tt>; it
was simply a <tt>zImage</tt>. That option is at the moment still available,
however, given the code size of newer kernels, it is now more or
less mandatory to build a <tt>bzImage</tt> because the older methods can't
handle a kernel that's just too large.
<p>

<sect1>Other ``make''ables <p>

`<tt>make mrproper</tt>' will do a more extensive `<tt>clean</tt>'ing.
It is sometimes necessary; you may wish to do it at every patch. `<tt>make
mrproper</tt>' will also delete your configuration file, so you might want
to make a backup of it (<tt>.config</tt>) if you see it as valuable.
<p>

`<tt>make oldconfig</tt>' will attempt to configure the kernel from an old
configuration file; it will run through the `<tt>make config</tt>' process
for you. If you haven't ever compiled a kernel before or don't have an old
config file, then you probably shouldn't do this, as you will most likely
want to change the default configuration.
<p>

See the section on modules for a description of `<tt>make modules</tt>'.
<p>

<sect1>Installing the kernel <p>
After you have a new kernel that seems to work the way you want it
to, it's time to install it. Most people use LILO (Linux Loader) for
this. `<tt>make bzlilo</tt>' will install the kernel, run LILO on it,
and get you all ready to boot, BUT ONLY if lilo is configured in the
following way on your system: kernel is
<tt>/vmlinuz</tt>, lilo is in <tt>/sbin</tt>, and your lilo config
(<tt>/etc/lilo.conf</tt>) agrees with this.
<p>

Otherwise, you need to use LILO directly. It's a fairly easy package to
install and work with, but it has a tendency to
confuse people with the configuration file.
Look at the config file (either <tt>/etc/lilo/config</tt> for older
versions or <tt>/etc/lilo.conf</tt> for new versions), and see what the
current setup is. The config file looks like this:
<p>

<verb>
    image = /vmlinuz
	label = Linux
	root = /dev/hda1
	...
</verb>

The `<tt>image =</tt>' is set to the currently installed kernel.
Most people use <tt>/vmlinuz</tt>. `<tt>label</tt>'
is used by lilo to determine which kernel or operating system to
boot, and `<tt>root</tt>' is the <tt>/</tt> of that particular operating
system. Make a backup
copy of your old kernel and copy the <tt>bzImage</tt>
which you just
made into place (you would say `<tt>cp bzImage /vmlinuz</tt>' if you
use `<tt>/vmlinuz</tt>').  Then, rerun lilo -- on newer systems, you can
just run `<tt>lilo</tt>', but on older stuff, you might have to do an
<tt>/etc/lilo/install</tt> or even an
<tt>/etc/lilo/lilo -C /etc/lilo/config</tt>.
<p>

If you would like to know more about LILO's configuration, or you don't have
LILO, get the newest version from your favorite ftp site and follow the
instructions.
<p>

To boot one of your old kernels off the hard disk
(another way to save yourself in case you screw up the new kernel),
copy the lines below (and including) `<tt>image = xxx</tt>' in the LILO config
file to the bottom of the file, and change the `<tt>image = xxx</tt>' to
`<tt>image = yyy</tt>', where `<tt>yyy</tt>' is the full pathname of
the file you saved your
backup kernel to. Then, change the `<tt>label = zzz</tt>' to
`<tt>label = linux-backup</tt>' and rerun <tt>lilo</tt>. You may need to
put a line in
the config file saying `<tt>delay=x</tt>', where x is an amount in tenths of a
second, which tells LILO to wait that much time before booting, so that you
can interrupt it (with the shift key, for example), and type in the label
of the backup boot image (in case unpleasant things happen).
<p>

<sect>Patching the kernel <p>

<sect1>Applying a patch <p>

Incremental upgrades of the kernel are distributed as patches. For
example, if you have version 1.1.45, and you notice that there's a
`<tt>patch46.gz</tt>' out there for it, it means you can upgrade to version
1.1.46 through application of the patch. You might want to make a backup of the
source tree first (`<tt>make clean</tt>' and then
`<tt>cd /usr/src; tar zcvf old-tree.tar.gz linux</tt>'
will make a compressed tar archive for you.).
<p>

So, continuing with the example above, let's suppose that
you have `<tt>patch46.gz</tt>' in <tt>/usr/src</tt>. <tt>cd</tt> to
<tt>/usr/src</tt>  and do a `<tt>zcat patch46.gz | patch -p0</tt>'
(or `<tt>patch -p0 &lt; patch46</tt>'
if the patch isn't compressed). You'll see things whizz by
(or flutter by, if your
system is that slow) telling you that it is trying to apply hunks,
and whether it succeeds or not. Usually, this action goes by too quickly for
you to read, and you're not too sure whether it worked or not, so you might
want to use the <tt>-s</tt> flag to <tt>patch</tt>, which tells <tt>patch</tt>
to only report error messages (you don't get as much of the ``hey, my
computer is actually doing something for a change!'' feeling, but you may
prefer this..). To look for
parts which might not have gone smoothly, cd to <tt>/usr/src/linux</tt>  and
look for files with a <tt>.rej</tt> extension. Some versions of <tt>patch</tt>
(older versions which may have been compiled with on an inferior
filesystem) leave the rejects with a <tt>&num;</tt> extension. You can use
`<tt>find</tt>' to look for you;
<verb>
    find .  -name '*.rej' -print
</verb>
prints all files who live in the current directory or any subdirectories with
a <tt>.rej</tt> extension to the standard output.
<p>

If everything went right, do a `<tt>make clean</tt>', `<tt>config</tt>',
and `<tt>dep</tt>' as described in sections 3 and 4.
<p>

There are quite a few options to the <tt>patch</tt> command. As mentioned
above, <tt>patch -s</tt>
will suppress all messages except the errors. If you keep your kernel
source in some other place than <tt>/usr/src/linux</tt>, <tt>patch -p1</tt>
(in that directory) will patch things cleanly. Other <tt>patch</tt> options are
well-documented in the manual page.
<p>

<sect1>If something goes wrong <p>

(Note: this section refers mostly to quite old kernels)<p>

The most frequent problem that used to arise was when a patch modified
a file called `<tt>config.in</tt>' and it didn't look quite right,
because you changed the options to suit your machine. This has been
taken care of, but one still might encounter it with an older release.
To fix it, look at the <tt>config.in.rej</tt>  file, and see what remains
of the original patch.
The changes will typically be marked with `<tt>+</tt>' and `<tt>-</tt>'
at the beginning of the
line. Look at the lines surrounding it, and remember if they were set to
`<tt>y</tt>' or `<tt>n</tt>'. Now, edit <tt>config.in</tt>, and change
`<tt>y</tt>' to `<tt>n</tt>' and `<tt>n</tt>' to `<tt>y</tt>'
when appropriate. Do a
<verb>
    patch -p0 < config.in.rej
</verb>
and if it reports that it
succeeded (no fails), then you can continue on with a configuration and
compilation. The <tt>config.in.rej</tt> file will remain, but you can get
delete it.
<p>

If you encounter further problems, you might have installed a patch out
of order. If patch says `<tt>previously applied patch detected: Assume
-R?</tt>', you are probably trying to apply a patch which is below your current
version number; if you answer `<tt>y</tt>', it will attempt to degrade
your source, and will most likely fail; thus, you will need to get a whole new
source tree (which might not have been such a bad idea in the first place).
<p>

To back out (unapply) a patch, use `<tt>patch -R</tt>' on the original patch.
<p>

The best thing to do when patches really turn out wrong is to start over
again with a clean, out-of-the-box source tree (for example, from one
of the <tt>linux-x.y.z.tar.gz</tt>  files), and start again.
<p>

<sect1>Getting rid of the .orig files <p>

After just a few patches, the <tt>.orig</tt>  files will start to pile up. For
example, one 1.1.51 tree I had was once last cleaned out at 1.1.48.
Removing the .orig files saved over a half a meg.
<verb>
    find .  -name '*.orig' -exec rm -f {} ';'
</verb>
will take care of it for you. Versions of <tt>patch</tt> which use
<tt>&num;</tt> for rejects use a tilde instead of <tt>.orig</tt>.
<p>
There are better ways to get rid of the <tt>.orig</tt> files, which
depend on GNU <tt>xargs</tt>:
<verb>
    find .  -name '*.orig' | xargs rm
</verb>
or the ``quite secure but a little more verbose'' method:
<verb>
    find . -name '*.orig' -print0 | xargs --null rm --
</verb>
<p>

<sect1>Other patches <p>

There are other patches (I'll call them ``nonstandard'') than the
ones Linus distributes. If you apply these, Linus' patches may not work
correctly and you'll have to either back them out, fix the source or
the patch, install a new source tree, or a combination of the above. This
can become very frustrating, so if you do not want to modify the source (with
the possibility of a very bad outcome), back
out the nonstandard patches before applying Linus', or just install a new
tree. Then, you can see
if the nonstandard patches still work. If they don't, you are either
stuck with an old kernel, playing with the patch or source to
get it to work, or waiting (possibly begging) for a new version of
the patch to come out.
<p>

How common are the patches not in the standard distribution? You will
probably hear of them. I used to use the noblink patch 
for my virtual consoles because I hate blinking cursors (This patch
is (or at least was) frequently updated for new kernel releases.). With
most newer device drivers being developed as loadable modules, though, the
frequecy of ``nonstandard'' patches is decreasing significantly.
<p>

<sect>Additional packages<p>
Your linux kernel has many features which are not explained in the
kernel source itself; these features are typically utilized through
external packages. Some of the most common are listed here.<p>

<sect1>kbd<p>
The linux console probably has more features than it deserves. Among these
are the ability to switch fonts, remap your keyboard, switch
video modes (in newer kernels), etc. The kbd package has programs which
allow the user to do all of this, plus many fonts and keyboard maps
for almost any keyboard, and is available from the same sites that carry
the kernel source.<p>

<sect1>util-linux<p>
Rik Faith (<tt>faith@cs.unc.edu</tt>) put together a large collection of
linux utilities which are, by odd coincidence, called util-linux. These are
now maintained by Andries Brouwer (<tt>util-linux@math.uio.no</tt>).
Available via
anonymous ftp from sunsite.unc.edu in <tt>/pub/Linux/system/misc</tt>, it
contains programs such as <tt>setterm</tt>, <tt>rdev</tt>, and
<tt>ctrlaltdel</tt>, which are relevant to the kernel. As Rik says, <it>do
not install without thinking;</it> you do not need to install everything in
the package, and it could very well cause serious problems if you do.
<p>

<sect1>hdparm<p>
As with many packages, this was once a kernel patch and support programs.
The patches made it into the official kernel, and the programs
to optimize and play with your hard disk are distributed separately.
<p>

<sect1>gpm<p>
gpm stands for general purpose mouse. This program allows you to cut and
paste text between virtual consoles and do other things with a large
variety of mouse types.
<p>

<sect>Some pitfalls <p>

<sect1>make clean <p>
If your new kernel does really weird things after a routine kernel upgrade,
chances are you forgot to <tt>make clean</tt> before compiling the new
kernel. Symptoms can be anything from
your system outright crashing, strange I/O problems, to crummy
performance. Make sure you do a <tt>make dep</tt>, too.
<p>

<sect1>Huge or slow kernels <p>
If your kernel is sucking up a lot of memory, is too large,
and/or just takes forever to compile even when you've got your new
Quadbazillium-III/4400 working on it, you've probably got lots of unneeded
stuff (device drivers, filesystems, etc) configured. If you don't use it,
don't configure it, because it does take up memory.
The most obvious symptom of kernel bloat is extreme swapping in and out of
memory to disk; if your disk is making a lot of noise and it's not one of
those old Fujitsu Eagles that sound like like a jet landing when turned
off, look over your kernel configuration.
<p>

You can find out how much memory the kernel is using by taking the
total amount of memory in your machine and subtracting from it the
amount of ``total mem'' in <tt>/proc/meminfo</tt>  or the output of the command
`<tt>free</tt>'.
<p>

<sect1>The parallel port doesn't work/my printer doesn't work<p>
Configuration options for PCs are: First, under the category `General Setup',
select `Parallel port support' and `PC-style hardware'. Then under
`Character devices', select `Parallel printer support'.
<p>
Then there are the names. Linux 2.2 names the printer devices differently
than previous releases. The upshot of this is that if you had an <tt>lp1</tt>
under your old kernel, it's probably an <tt>lp0</tt> under your new one.
Use `<tt>dmesg</tt>' or look through the logs in <tt>/var/log</tt> to find
out.
<p>

<sect1>Kernel doesn't compile <p>

If it does not compile, then it is likely that a patch failed, or your
source is somehow corrupt. Your version of gcc also might not
be correct, or could also be corrupt (for example, the include files
might be in error). Make sure that the symbolic links which
Linus describes in the <tt>README</tt> are set up correctly. In general, if
a standard kernel
does not compile, something is seriously wrong with the system, and 
reinstallation of certain tools is probably necessary.
<p>

In some cases, gcc can crash due to hardware problems. The error
message will be something like ``xxx exited with signal 15'' and it will
generally look very mysterious. I probably would not mention this, except
that it happened to me once - I had some bad cache memory, and the compiler
would occasionally barf at random. Try reinstalling gcc first if you
experience problems. You should only get suspicious if your kernel compiles
fine with external cache turned off, a reduced amount of RAM, etc.
<p>

It tends to disturb people when it's suggested that their hardware has
problems. Well, I'm not making this up. There is an FAQ for it -- it's at
<tt>http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/</tt>.
<p>

<sect1>New version of the kernel doesn't seem to boot<p>

You did not run LILO, or it is not configured correctly. One thing that
``got'' me once was a problem in the config file; it said `<tt>boot =
/dev/hda1</tt>'
instead of `<tt>boot = /dev/hda</tt>' (This can be really annoying at first,
but once you have a working config file, you shouldn't need to
change it.).
<p>

<sect1> You forgot to run LILO, or system doesn't boot at all<p>

Ooops! The best thing you can do here is to boot off of a floppy disk or
CDROM and
prepare another bootable floppy (such as `<tt>make zdisk</tt>' would do).
You need to know where your root (<tt>/</tt>) filesystem is and what type
it is (e.g. second extended, minix). In the example below, you also need
to know what filesystem your <tt>/usr/src/linux</tt> source
tree is on, its type, and where it is normally mounted.<p>

In the following example, <tt>/</tt> is <tt>/dev/hda1</tt>, and the
filesystem which holds <tt>/usr/src/linux</tt>
is <tt>/dev/hda3</tt>, normally mounted at <tt>/usr</tt>. Both are
second extended filesystems. The working kernel image in
<tt>/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot</tt> is called <tt>bzImage</tt>.<p>

The idea is that if there is a functioning
<tt>bzImage</tt>, it is possible to use that
for the new floppy. Another alternative, which may or may not work better
(it depends on the particular method in which you messed up your system) is
discussed after the example.<p>

First, boot from a boot/root disk combo or rescue disk, and
mount the filesystem which contains the working kernel image:<p>

<verb>
    mkdir /mnt
    mount -t ext2 /dev/hda3 /mnt
</verb>

If <tt>mkdir</tt> tells you that the directory already exists, just ignore
it. Now, <tt>cd</tt> to the place where the working kernel image was. Note
that
<verb>
/mnt + /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot - /usr = /mnt/src/linux/arch/i386/boot
</verb>
Place a formatted
disk in drive ``A:'' (not your boot or root disk!), dump
the image to the disk, and configure it for your root filesystem:<p>

<verb>
    cd /mnt/src/linux/arch/i386/boot
    dd if=bzImage of=/dev/fd0
    rdev /dev/fd0 /dev/hda1
</verb>

<tt>cd</tt> to <tt>/</tt> and unmount the normal <tt>/usr</tt> filesystem:<p>
<verb>
    cd /
    umount /mnt
</verb>

You should now be able to reboot your system as normal from this floppy.
Don't forget to run lilo (or whatever it was that you did wrong) after
the reboot!<p>

As mentioned above, there is another common alternative. If you
happened to have a working kernel image in <tt>/</tt> (<tt>/vmlinuz</tt>
for example), you can use that for a boot disk. Supposing all of the above
conditions, and that my kernel image is <tt>/vmlinuz</tt>, just make these
alterations to the example above: change
<tt>/dev/hda3</tt> to <tt>/dev/hda1</tt> (the <tt>/</tt> filesystem),
<tt>/mnt/src/linux</tt> to
<tt>/mnt</tt>, and <tt>if=bzImage</tt> to <tt>if=vmlinuz</tt>. The
note explaining how to derive <tt>/mnt/src/linux</tt> may be ignored.
<p>

Using LILO with big drives (more than 1024 cylinders) can cause problems.
See the LILO mini-HOWTO or documentation for help on that.
<p>

<sect1>It says `warning: bdflush not running' <p>

This can be a severe problem. Starting with a kernel release
after 1.0 (around 20 Apr 1994), a program called `<tt>update</tt>' which
periodically flushes out the filesystem buffers, was upgraded/replaced. Get
the sources to `<tt>bdflush</tt>'
(you should find it where you got your kernel source), and install it (you
probably want to run your system under the old kernel while doing this). It
installs itself as `<tt>update</tt>' and after a reboot, the new kernel
should no longer complain.
<p>

<sect1>I can't get my IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM drive to work<p>
Strangely enough, lots of people cannot get their ATAPI drives working,
probably because there are a number of things that can go wrong.
<p>
If your CD-ROM drive is the only device on a particular IDE
interface, it must be jumpered as ``master'' or ``single.'' Supposedly,
this is the most common error.
<p>
Creative Labs (for one) has put IDE interfaces on their sound cards now.
However, this leads to the interesting problem that while some people only
have one interface to being with, many have two IDE interfaces built-in to
their motherboards (at IRQ15, usually), so a common practice is to make the
soundblaster interface a third IDE port (IRQ11, or so I'm told).
<p>
This causes problems with linux in that versions 1.2.x don't support a third
IDE interface (there is support in starting somewhere in the 1.3.x series
but that's development, remember, and it doesn't auto-probe). To get around
this, you have a few choices.<p>
<p>
If you have a second IDE port already, chances are that you are not using
it or it doesn't already have two devices on it. Take the ATAPI drive off
the sound card and put it on the second interface. You can then disable the
sound card's interface, which saves an IRQ anyway.
<p>
If you don't have a second interface, jumper the sound card's interface
(not the sound card's sound part) as IRQ15, the second interface. It should
work.
<p>

<sect1>It says weird things about obsolete routing requests <p>

Get new versions of the <tt>route</tt> program and any other programs
which do route manipulation.
<tt>/usr/include/linux/route.h</tt>  (which is actually a file in
<tt>/usr/src/linux</tt>) has changed.
<p>

<sect1>Firewalling not working in 1.2.0<p>
Upgrade to at least version 1.2.1.
<p>

<sect1>``Not a compressed kernel Image file''<p>
Don't use the <tt>vmlinux</tt> file created in <tt>/usr/src/linux</tt> as
your boot image; <tt>[..]/arch/i386/boot/bzImage</tt> is the right
one.
<p>

<sect1>Problems with console terminal after upgrade to 1.3.x<p>
Change the word <tt>dumb</tt> to <tt>linux</tt> in the console termcap
entry in <tt>/etc/termcap</tt>. You may also have to make a terminfo entry.
<p>

<sect1> Can't seem to compile things after kernel upgrade<p>
The linux kernel source includes a number of include files (the things that
end with <tt>.h</tt>) which are referenced by the standard ones in
<tt>/usr/include</tt>. They are typically referenced like this (where
<tt>xyzzy.h</tt> would be something in <tt>/usr/include/linux</tt>):
<verb>
    #include <linux/xyzzy.h>
</verb>
Normally, there is a link called <tt>linux</tt> in <tt>/usr/include</tt> to
the <tt>include/linux</tt> directory of your kernel source
(<tt>/usr/src/linux/include/linux</tt> in the typical system). If this link
is not there, or points to the wrong place, most things will not compile at
all. If you decided that the kernel source was taking too much room on the
disk and deleted it, this will obviously be a problem. Another way it might
go wrong is with file permissions; if your <tt>root</tt> has a umask
which doesn't allow other users to see its files by default, and you
extracted the kernel source without the <tt>p</tt> (preserve filemodes)
option, those users also won't be able to use the C compiler. Although you
could use the <tt>chmod</tt> command to fix this, it is probably easier to
re-extract the include files. You can do this the same way you did the
whole source at the beginning, only with an additional argument:<p>
<verb>
    blah# tar zxvpf linux.x.y.z.tar.gz linux/include
</verb>
Note: ``<tt>make config</tt>'' will recreate the <tt>/usr/src/linux</tt>
link if it isn't there.
<p>

<sect1>Increasing limits<p>
The following few <it>example</it> commands may be helpful to those
wondering how to increase certain soft limits imposed by the kernel:
<verb>
echo 4096 > /proc/sys/kernel/file-max
echo 12288 > /proc/sys/kernel/inode-max
echo 300 400 500 > /proc/sys/vm/freepages
</verb>
<p>

<sect>Note for upgrade to version 2.0.x, 2.2.x<p>
Kernel versions 2.0.x and 2.2.x introduced quite a bit of changes for kernel
installation. The file <tt>Documentation/Changes</tt> in the 2.0.x source
tree contains information that you should know when upgrading to either of
these versions. You will most likely need to upgrade several key packages,
such as gcc, libc, and SysVInit, and perhaps alter some system files, so
expect this. Don't panic, though.
<p>

<sect>Modules<p>
Loadable kernel modules can save memory and ease configuration. The scope
of modules has grown to include filesystems, ethernet card drivers, tape
drivers, printer drivers, and more.
<p>

<sect1>Installing the module utilities<p>
The module utilities are available from wherever you got your kernel
source as <tt>modutils-x.y.z.tar.gz</tt>; choose the highest
patchlevel <tt>x.y.z</tt> that is equal to or below that of your current
kernel. Unpack it with `<tt>tar zxvf modutils-x.y.z.tar.gz</tt>',
<tt>cd</tt> to the directory it creates (<tt>modutils-x.y.z</tt>), look
over the <tt>README</tt>, and carry out its installation instructions
(which is usually something simple, such as <tt>make install</tt>). You
should now have the programs
<tt>insmod</tt>, <tt>rmmod</tt>, <tt>ksyms</tt>, <tt>lsmod</tt>, 
<tt>genksyms</tt>, <tt>modprobe</tt>, and <tt>depmod</tt> in
<tt>/sbin</tt>. If you wish,
test out the utilities with the ``hw'' example driver in <tt>insmod</tt>; look
over the <tt>INSTALL</tt> file in that subdirectory for details.
<p>
<tt>insmod</tt> inserts a module into the running kernel. Modules
usually have a <tt>.o</tt> extension; the example driver mentioned above
is called <tt>drv_hello.o</tt>, so to insert this, one would say
`<tt>insmod drv_hello.o</tt>'. To see the modules that the kernel is
currently using, use <tt>lsmod</tt>. The output looks like this:
<verb>
    blah# lsmod
    Module:        #pages:  Used by:
    drv_hello          1
</verb>
`<tt>drv_hello</tt>' is the name of the module, it uses one page (4k) of
memory, and no other kernel modules depend on it at the moment. To remove
this module, use `<tt>rmmod drv_hello</tt>'. Note that <tt>rmmod</tt>
wants a <it>module name,</it> not a filename; you get this from
<tt>lsmod</tt>'s listing. The other module utilities' purposes are documented
in their manual pages.
<p>

<sect1>Modules distributed with the kernel<p>
As of version 2.0.30, most of everything is available as a loadable
modules. To use
them, first make sure that you don't configure them into the regular
kernel; that is, don't say <tt>y</tt> to it during `<tt>make config</tt>'.
Compile a new kernel and reboot with it. Then, <tt>cd</tt> to
<tt>/usr/src/linux</tt> again, and do a `<tt>make modules</tt>'. This
compiles all of the modules which you did not specify in the kernel
configuration, and places links to them in <tt>/usr/src/linux/modules</tt>.
You can use them straight from that directory or execute `<tt>make
modules_install</tt>', which installs them in
<tt>/lib/modules/x.y.z</tt>, where <tt>x.y.z</tt> is the kernel release.
<p>

This can be especially handy with filesystems. You may not use the minix
or msdos filesystems frequently. For example, if I encountered an msdos
(shudder) floppy, I would <tt>insmod /usr/src/linux/modules/msdos.o</tt>,
and then <tt>rmmod msdos</tt> when finished. This procedure saves about
50k of RAM in the kernel during normal operation. A small note is in order for
the minix filesystem: you should <it>always</it> configure it directly into the
kernel for use in ``rescue'' disks.
<p>

<sect>Tips and tricks <p>

<sect1>Redirecting output of the make or patch commands <p>

If you would like logs of what those `<tt>make</tt>' or `<tt>patch</tt>'
commands did, you can redirect output to a file. First,
find out what shell you're running:
`<tt>grep root /etc/passwd</tt>' and look for something like
`<tt>/bin/csh</tt>'.
<p>

If you use sh or bash,
<verb>
    (command) 2>&1 | tee (output file)
</verb>
will place a copy of <tt>(command)</tt>'s output in the
file `<tt>(output file)</tt>'.
<p>

For csh or tcsh, use
<verb>
    (command) |& tee (output file)
</verb>
<p>

For rc (Note: you probably do not use rc) it's
<verb>
    (command) >[2=1] | tee (output file)
</verb>
<p>

<sect1>Conditional kernel install <p>
Other than using floppy disks, there are several methods of testing out a new
kernel without touching the old one. Unlike many other Unix flavors, LILO has
the ability to boot a kernel from anywhere on the disk (if you have a
large (500 MB or above) disk, please read over the LILO documentation on
how this may cause problems). So, if you add something similar to
<verb>
    image = /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage
        label = new_kernel
</verb>
to the end of your LILO configuration file, you can choose to run a newly
compiled kernel without touching your old <tt>/vmlinuz</tt> (after running
<tt>lilo</tt>, of course). The easiest way to tell LILO to boot a new
kernel is to press the shift key at bootup time (when it says
<tt>LILO</tt> on the screen, and nothing else), which gives you a prompt.
At this point, you can enter `<tt>new_kernel</tt>' to boot the new kernel.
<p>
If you wish to keep several different kernel source trees on your system at
the same time (this can take up a <it>lot</it> of disk space; be careful), the
most common way is to name them <tt>/usr/src/linux-x.y.z</tt>, where
<tt>x.y.z</tt> is the kernel version. You can then ``select'' a source
tree with a symbolic link; for example, `<tt>ln -sf linux-1.2.2
/usr/src/linux</tt>' would make the 1.2.2 tree current. Before creating a
symbolic link like this, make certain that the last argument to
<tt>ln</tt> is not a real directory (old symbolic links are fine); the
result will not be what you expect.
<p>

<sect1>Kernel updates <p>
Russell Nelson (<tt>nelson@crynwr.com</tt>) summarizes the changes in new
kernel releases. These are short, and you might like to look at them
before an upgrade. They are available with anonymous ftp from
<tt>ftp.emlist.com</tt> in <tt>pub/kchanges</tt> or through the URL

<sect1>Author <p>

The author and maintainer of the Linux Kernel-HOWTO is Brian Ward

<p>

Even though I try to be attentive as possible with mail, please remember
that I get a <it>lot</it> of it every day, so it may take a little time to
get back to you. Especially when emailing me with a question, please try
extra hard to be clear and detailed in your message. If you're writing
about non-working hardware (or something like that), I need to know what
your hardware configureation is. If you report an error, don't just say
``I tried this but it gave an error;'' I need to know what the error was.
I would also like to know what versions of the kernel, gcc, and libc you're
using. If you just tell me you're using this-or-that distribution, it won't
tell me much at all. I don't care if you
ask simple questions; remember, if you don't ask, you may never get an
answer! I'd like to thank everyone who has given me feedback.
<p>
If your question does not relate to the kernel, or is in some language that
I don't understand, I may not answer.
<p>

If you mailed me and did not get an answer within a resonable amount of
time (three weeks or more), then chances are that I accidentally deleted your
message or something (sorry). Please try again.
<p>

I get a lot of mail about thing which are actually hardware problems or
issues. That's OK, but please try to keep in mind that I'm not familiar
with all of the hardware in the world. I use AMD processors, Adaptec and
Sybios SCSI controllers, and IBM SCSI disks.

The document is written using a tool called "SGML-Tools" which can be got from - 
<url url="http://www.sgmltools.org">
Compiling the source you will get the following commands like
<itemize>
<item>sgml2html Kernel-HOWTO.sgml     (to generate html file)
<item>sgml2rtf  Kernel-HOWTO.sgml     (to generate RTF file)
<item>sgml2latex Kernel-HOWTO.sgml    (to generate latex file)
</itemize>

LaTeX documents may be converted into PDF files simply by 
producing a Postscript output using <bf>sgml2latex</bf> ( and dvips) and running the
output through the Acrobat <bf>distill</bf> (<url url="http://www.adobe.com">) command as follows: 
<code>
bash$ man sgml2latex
bash$ sgml2latex filename.sgml
bash$ man dvips
bash$ dvips -o filename.ps filename.dvi
bash$ distill filename.ps
bash$ man ghostscript
bash$ man ps2pdf
bash$ ps2pdf input.ps output.pdf
bash$ acroread output.pdf &
</code>
Or you can use Ghostscript command <bf>ps2pdf</bf>.
ps2pdf is a work-alike for nearly all the functionality of 
Adobe's Acrobat Distiller product: it
converts PostScript files to Portable Document Format (PDF) files. 
<bf>ps2pdf</bf> is implemented as a very small command script (batch file) that invokes Ghostscript, selecting a special "output device"
called <bf>pdfwrite</bf>. In order to use ps2pdf, the pdfwrite device must be included in the makefile when Ghostscript was compiled;
see the documentation on building Ghostscript for details.
