<sect> Introduction
<p> This is the long-overdue Sentry Firewall CDROM howto.  I hope this
document helps get you started using the Sentry Firewall CD and answers
any questions you might have regarding how the system works.  The most
current version of this howto can be obtained at the following URL:

If you would like to add anything to this document, or if you have any
questions or comments please feel free to email me, <url url="mailto:Obsid@Sentry.net?subject=HOWTO"

<newline>
<sect1> What is the Sentry Firewall CD?
<p> The Sentry Firewall CD is a Linux-based bootable CDROM suitable
for use in a variety of different operating environments.  The system is
designed to be configured dynamically via a floppy disk or over a network.
This allows one to configure the system dynamically, eventho much of the actual
system is on read-only(CDROM) media.


<newline>
<sect1> Why would I use a CD-based firewall or server?
<p> There are several advantages of using a CDROM based system in various
security related environments.  The main system is centered around the ramdisk;
a compressed file system image which is loaded into RAM at boot time.  Any
changes to the ramdisk image are temporary, and will be undone upon the next
reboot. Furthermore, the ramdisk, kernel, binaries, etc,  related to the
operating system are kept on read-only media(CDROM).  This means that if the
security of a box running a CDROM based system is ever compromised the attacker
can at best own the box until the next reboot.  So there is no real threat of
having to go through the tedious task of rebuilding and hardening the system
after a successful attack is discovered.


<newline>
<sect1> I'm a Linux newbie, will Sentry Firewall CD be a good choice for me?
<p> At the moment, the Sentry Firewall CD is based on a pretty generic Slackware
Linux system.  You should probably be somewhat familiar with Linux and how to
configure the system in order to get the most use out of the CD.  But, even if
you are a Linux newbie, I encourage you to give it a shot anyway - it's free,
after all.

But, basically, there are no GUIs, no scripts to do it for you.  The idea
behind the configuration of the CD is that you are able to reconfigure the
system by replacing the startup scripts and the various system and configuration
files present on the system at boot time.  Most of these are simply text files
and shell scripts that you need to edit by hand in order to configure properly.
There are, however, usually plenty of resources available to assist you in
configuring a specific service or daemon(HOWTOs on linux.org, for example).

<newline>
<sect> How the CD Works (Overview)
<p> This section is just an overview to explain how the Sentry Firewall CD works,
that is, from the process of loading the kernel to running the Sentry Firewall
CD configuration scripts located on the RAMDisk.

<newline>
<sect1> The boot process
<p> Booting from the CDROM is a fairly familiar process. The BIOS execs the
bootloader(Syslinux) - which then displays a bootprompt and loads the kernel and
ramdisk into memory.  Once the kernel is running, the ramdisk is then mounted as
root(/).

An obvious necessity for deploying CDROM based systems is the ability to
dynamically configure the system for various environments with different
configurations, which is what a good majority of this project is dedicated to
building.  A simple way to do this is to give the user the ability to customize
the startup scripts located in /etc/rc.d before they are actually used, as well
as the ability to customize other important system configuration files.

At boot time, the /etc and /etc/rc.d directories are nearly empty.  On a
Slackware system the first rc file to run is /etc/rc.d/rc.S - and it is from
this file where we run the configuration scripts that look for a configuration
file(sentry.conf), and place the proper configuration and system files in /etc
and various subdirectories under /etc.  If there is not a configuration
directive for a specific file, or if a configuration file cannot be found, then
the default system files are used - which are located in /etc/default/* on the
ramdisk.


<newline>
<sect1> ISOLINUX
<p> Early versions of the Sentry Firewall CD utilized the 2.88MB floppy
emulation method, along with either lilo or syslinux to boot the kernel and load
the ramdisk.  This method proved very limiting for two reasons; A) the total
size of the compressed ramdisk AND kernel was limited to 2.88MB, and B) it was
quite slow compared to the current method.

The Sentry Firewall CD is currently utilizing the isolinux.bin boot record
with no emulation in order to properly boot the CDs.  This allows us to use a
much larger ramdisk and offer a choice of several kernels to boot at boot time.

More information about syslinux can be found at <url
url="http://syslinux.zytor.com/" name="syslinux.zytor.com">.


<newline>
<sect1> The CD Configuration scripts
<p> As previously mentioned, the first rc script to run on a Slackware system is
called /etc/rc.d/rc.S.  It is from this file where we run our configuration
scripts, which reside in /etc/rc.d/SENTRY/ on the ramdisk.  The first script to
run is called 'cd-config.pl', which is essentially the mainline for the entire
program.  The other scripts that are used are called 'get_config.pl',
'process_conf.pl', and 'networking.pl'.  These scripts were written specifically
for this project, and are essentially the mainstay of the entire configuration
process.

In depth review of these scripts is a little beyond the scope of this
document, but is covered a bit in the file called 'DOCUMENTATION' available on
the website (<url url="http://www.SentryFirewall.com/">).  The files are written
in perl, and do several important things; read in and parse the configuration
file(sentry.conf), locate and retrieve the important files detailed in the
sentry.conf file, and replace the system default files with the ones the user
has defined in the configuration file.

<sect> Obtaining the CDROM
<sect1> Downloading
<p> The CDROM is distributed as a gzip or bzip2 compressed iso image, and is
generally between 95-105MB in size.  Available download mirrors are listed
on the websites, <url url="http://www.SentryFirewall.com/"> or <url
url="http://Sentry.Sourceforge.net/">.

<newline>
<sect1> Purchasing
<p> The Sentry Firewall CD is also available for purchase over the web.
Although the iso image is free to use and distribute, purchasing the CD will
help support the project and help ensure continued development.  For more
information please visit <url url="http://www.SentryFirewall.com/purchase/">

Custom versions of the CD tailored to a specific network configuration are
also available upon request.  Please <url
url="mailto:Obsid@Sentry.net" name="email me"> for more information.

<newline>
<sect1> Burning the CDROM
<p> This section will attempt a general overview on how to burn the CD iso
image once you have obtained it from one of the mirrors.  All the commands
presume you're working in Linux, if not, then I'm afraid you're on your own.

First, let's decompress the iso image: <newline>
<bf>NOTE:</bf> Make sure you have enough disk space, the decompressed iso image can be
somewhere between 250MB and 300MB.

<tscreen><verb>
blah@wherever:&tilde;&dollar; gzip -d sentrycd.iso.gz

or

blah@wherever:&tilde;&dollar; bzip2 -d sentrycd.iso.bz2
</verb></tscreen>

Verify the integrity of the iso image,
<tscreen><verb>
blah@wherever:&tilde;&dollar; md5sum -b sentrycd.iso
</verb></tscreen>

<p> Now, let's try to burn the CD.  You'll need the 'cdrecord' utility
available, it can be obtained <url
url="http://www.fokus.gmd.de/research/cc/glone/employees/joerg.schilling/private/cdrecord.html" name="here">.
You will want to run 'cdrecord -scanbus' in order to find the 'dev' value
required for the following command.  You will also need to know the write speed
of your CDRW.  Details on how to set this all up are beyond the scope of this
document, please refer to the <url url="http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/CD-Writing-HOWTO.html" name="CD Writing HOWTO">
for more details.

<tscreen><verb>
blah@wherever:&tilde;&dollar; DEV="DEV_LINE_HERE" SPEED="SPEED"
blah@wherever:&tilde;&dollar; cdrecord -v -data speed=$SPEED dev=$DEV sentrycd.iso
</verb></tscreen>

That's it, you now have a Sentry Firewall CDROM.  By the way, you
may have to be root to do all this.

Keep in mind, if you simply want to look at the ISO image without actually
burning the CD, you can mount the image on a loopback device;

<tscreen><verb>
blah@wherever:&tilde;&dollar; mount -o loop ./sentrycd.iso /MOUNT_POINT
</verb></tscreen>

Where &dquot;MOUNT_POINT&dquot; is where you would like the CD mounted.  You may
then 'cd' to the MOUNT_POINT directory and poke around - don't forget to 'umount' the
image once you're finished.  This assumes you have support in your kernel for
the loopback device.  You probably do, but once again, recompiling kernels is
beyond the scope of this document.

<sect> Using the Sentry Firewall CDROM
<sect1> Introduction
<p> The configuration scripts which are run from /etc/rc.d/rc.S first look for
a configuration file called 'sentry.conf' on a floppy disk which, if present,
will be mounted on /floppy.  In order to configure the Linux system for use
in any particular environment the user must have the ability to replace the
system default files with his/her own copies.  The 'sentry.conf' file basically
tells the configuration scripts which files it should replace and where those
files are.

A good example of a sentry.conf file can be found on the Sentry Firewall CD
in the directory /SENTRY/scripts/cd-config/.  Configuration floppy disk
images(1.44M) can also be found in /SENTRY/images/ on the CD.

<newline>
<sect1> The sentry.conf file
<p> The main configuration file for the system is called 'sentry.conf'.  It will
first be looked for on a floppy disk(/dev/fd0).  The file accepts several
configuration directives, many of which will be discussed below.

<newline>
<sect2> Example
<p>
A basic configuration file looks like the following (everything after a '&num;'
sign is interpreted as a comment):

<verb>
----snip----
&num;&num; Basic Sentry Firewall CD config file(sentry.conf)

rc.M = /floppy/config1/rc.M
rc.inet1 = /floppy/config1/rc.inet1

passwd = /floppy/config1/passwd
shadow = /floppy/config1/shadow

&num; EOF &num;
----snip----
</verb>

The syntax is pretty simple, the default 'rc.M' file will be replaced with
the user defined 'rc.M' file located in the '/floppy/config1/' directory.  Same
goes for 'rc.inet1', 'passwd', and the 'shadow' file.   But it is imortant to
remember, the first place the sentry.conf file will be looked for is on
/dev/fd0, which if found, will be mounted on /floppy.  This is why all these
files appear to be located in the /floppy directory, it is simply the mount
point for the floppy disk.

Unfortunately, you cannot arbitrarily replace files, for example the
following will likely not be parsed correctly:
<verb>
     foo.conf = /floppy/config1/foo.conf
</verb>

The configuration scripts only recognize a certain number of configuration
files.  There are other very easy ways to replace files that are not supported
by default, however.  These will be discussed below.


<newline>
<sect1> Network Configuration
<p> As of version 1.0.5, a new syntax for the configuration directives are
recognized; those with an "http://" or "ftp://" prefix.  This basically means
that the following syntax is now supported:
<verb>
     inetd.conf = ftp://user:pass@123.123.123.123/config1/inetd.conf
</verb>

In order to accomplish this the configuration scripts need to have the
ability to set up an ethernet interface, as well as obtain nameserver
information from the sentry.conf file.  The syntax to accomplish this is the
following:
<verb>
     device{1..10} = &lt;device&gt;:&lt;driver&gt;:&lt;IP address&gt;[|Gateway_IP]

     or..

     device{1..10} = &lt;device&gt;:&lt;driver&gt;:dhcp[|Hostname]
</verb>

And to set up a nameserver:

<verb>
     nameserver = &lt;IP_ADDRESS&gt;
</verb>

So, for example to set up an interface called "eth0", which uses the "tulip"
driver and can obtain its ip address from a DHCP server, we can use the
following line:
<verb>
     device1 = eth0:tulip:dhcp
</verb>

<p> As you can see, a total of 10 devices are allowed.  Let's say we now want to
set up an interface "eth1" that uses an "rtl8139" chip, and has a static
IP(192.168.1.2) and a default gateway(192.168.1.1):
<verb>
     device2 = eth1:8139too:192.168.1.2|192.168.1.1
</verb>

<bf>NOTE:</BF> It is important to keep in mind that whatever devices you set up during the
configuration process will be promptly taken down after the configuration is
complete.  This setup is only used so you can retrieve configuration files over
the network, via http and ftp.  For more permanant network configuration, please
use the rc.inet1 file.


<newline>
<sect2> Example
<p>
<verb>
----snip----
&num;&num; Basic Sentry Firewall CD config file to retrieve files via http or ftp.

device1 = eth0:tulip:192.168.1.2|192.168.1.1
nameserver = &lt;MY_DNS_IP&gt;

rc.M = ftp://user:pass@config.sentry.net/node1/rc.M
rc.inet1 = http://user:pass@config.sentry.net/all_nodes/rc.inet1

passwd = http://user:pass@config.sentry.net/all_nodes/passwd
shadow = ftp://user:pass@config.sentry.net/node1/shadow

&num; EOF &num;
----snip----

</verb>

<newline>
<sect1> Other Useful Configuration Directives
<p> Copy file /floppy/someconfig.conf to /etc/someconfig.conf -
<verb>
     /floppy/someconfig.conf |= /etc/someconfig.conf

     OR, this does the same thing.

     /etc/someconfig.conf = /floppy/someconfig.conf
</verb>

Make a symlink called /etc/someconfig.conf that points to
/etc/otherconfig.conf -

<verb>

     /etc/someconfig.conf => /etc/otherconfig.conf

</verb>

The include directive.  Grabs another sentry.conf file either from another
location -
<verb>

     include = ftp://user:pass@config.sentry.net/node1/sentry.conf

</verb>

Keep in mind, however, that the include directive is one of the first directives
to be parsed.  Any configuration directives parsed from the included sentry.conf
file that conflict with directives in the previously parsed sentry.conf files
will clobber the old ones.


<newline>
<sect1> Putting it all together, managing multiple nodes from a single location.
<p> In order to manage multiple nodes at a single location, you can use a bare
sentry.conf file located on a floppy disk, and then grab files from your ftp or
http servers.

<verb>
----snip----
&num;&num; Basic Sentry Firewall CD config file.

device1 = eth0:tulip:dhcp
nameserver = &lt;DNS_IP&gt;
include = ftp://user:pass@config.sentry.net/node1/sentry.conf

----snip----
</verb>

The included sentry.conf file will then be parsed, and files replaced via http
or ftp if you like.  You can now edit your sentry.conf and configuration files
at a central location.


<newline>
<sect1> Example sentry.conf and disk images
<p> An example configuration disk image is available on the CDROM.  The disk is
an ext2 formatted disk, and is located in the '/SENTRY/images/' directory on the
CD.  There is also a very complete sentry.conf file on the disk which may help
clarify alot of these directives.  Use a command like the following to create
the configuration disk:

<tscreen><verb>
blah@wherever:&tilde;&dollar; dd if=/cdrom/SENTRY/images/ext2-144.img of=/dev/fd0
2880+0 records in
2880+0 records out
</verb></tscreen>

<!-- BEGIN SECTION 5.0 -->

<newline>
<sect> Overview of Available Configuration Directives
<sect1> Replacing rc/config files
<p> To replace a file that is supported by the configuration scripts, you may
use the following syntax:
<verb>
     filename = /location/of/filename
</verb>
Where the location of the file is often '/floppy/filename'

The following rc/config files are currently supported

<tscreen><verb>
rc.M
rc.netdevice
rc.inet1
rc.inet2
rc.local
rc.modules
rc.firewall
rc.firewall.nat
fstab

ssh_host_dsa_key.pub
ssh_host_rsa_key
ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
ssh_known_hosts
ssh_known_hosts2
</verb></tscreen>

To replace files not supported by the configuration scripts, use the
'|=' file copy directive discussed below.


<newline>
<sect1> 'device' directive support
<p> Set up an ethernet device to use during configuration.

<verb>
     device[&num;] = [device_name]:[driver_name]:[IP_Address]<|gateway>
     device[&num;] = [device_name]:[driver_name]:dhcp<|hostname>

     NOTE: 1) &lt;hostname&gt; and &lt;gateway&gt; are optional, but sometimes required.
           2) Most ethernet devices are supported.  If you find one that isn't
              and you think it should be, please let me know.
           3) "device1" to "device10" are supported.

Examples:
     device1 = eth0:tulip:192.168.1.50|192.168.1.1
     device2 = eth1:via-rhine:dhcp

</verb>


<newline>
<sect1> 'nameserver' directive
<p> Set up a nameserver to use during configuration.

<verb>
     nameserver = &lt;DNS_IP&gt;
</verb>


<newline>
<sect1> 'include' directive
<p> Retrieve and parse another 'sentry.conf' file.

<verb>
     include = &lt;/location/of/sentry.conf&gt;

     Or, with network support -

     include = &lt;ftp|http&gt;://[&lt;user&gt;:&lt;pass&gt;@]&lt;SERVER_IP&gt;&lt;/path/to/sentry.conf&gt;
</verb>


<newline>
<sect1> Copying files (|=)
<p> Copy file from one location to the other.

<verb>
     Syntax: source_file |= dest_file

Example:
     Copy file /floppy/daemon.conf to /etc/daemon.conf
     /floppy/daemon.conf |= /etc/daemon.conf

</verb>


<newline>
<sect1> Making Symlinks (=>)
<p> Create a symlink

<verb>
     Syntax: dest_file => source_file(where the symlink points to)

Example:
     Make symlink called /etc/somefile.conf that points to /etc/otherfile.conf
     /etc/somefile.conf => /etc/otherfile.conf

</verb>


<newline>
<sect1> 'cdrom' directive
<p> Defines which device the CDROM is.  Most of the time the CDROM is detected
and mounted using the /etc/rc.d/rc.cdrom script.  But this makes the process
less error-prone.

<verb>
     Syntax: cdrom = &lt;DEVICE&gt;

Example:
     cdrom = /dev/hdc

</verb>


<newline>
<sect1> 'cron' directive
<p> Replace a user's crontab file(located in /var/spool/cron/crontabs/).

<verb>
Syntax: cron:&lt;USERNAME&gt; = &lt;/LOCATION/OF/CRONTAB_FILE&gt;

</verb>


<newline>
<sect1> hostname
<p> Defines the hostname of the local machine.  This directive can be used to
either point to a file containing the hostname of the local machine, or to
define the hostname itself.

<verb>
     Syntax: hostname = &lt;/path/to/file&gt;
             or
             hostname = MYHOSTNAME

<sect> Building a Custom Sentry CD
<sect1> Introduction
<p> This section will attempt to describe how to create a custom Sentry Firewall
CDROM.  Unfortunately, I do not have to time to go into every detail.  But at
the very least I will try and provide for you an overview of the CD creation
process.


<newline>
<sect1> The development system(How I do it)
<p> My development system consists of 2 separate Slackware installations.
First, I have a very complete Slackware installation on my main hard
drive(/dev/hda).  I then have /dev/hdb1, upon which I have another, bare bones,
Slackware installation.  This installation generally has no compiling tools or X
stuff.  I usually have /dev/hdb1 mounted on /mnt, that's not a critical element,
but I thought I'd mention it since I will refer to /mnt alot from now on.  I
then have a folder called /CD-FW on the /dev/hdb1 installation.  Throughout this
entire process, the Slackware installation on /dev/hda is the live running
system, and it is from here that I compile the needed tools, kernels, etc and
basically run everything.

I begin by copying nearly all the files from /mnt to /mnt/CD-FW in order to
produce what will be the next Sentry Firewall CD.  For example, I have a script
that does something like the following:

<verb>
        &num;&num; This usually spits out alot of errors, usually crap about
        &num;&num; hard links and such, but they are all ignorable.

	cp -Rdp /mnt/bin /mnt/CD-FW/
	cp -Rdp /mnt/sbin /mnt/CD-FW/
	cp -Rdp /mnt/lib /mnt/CD-FW/
	cp -Rdp /mnt/usr/bin /mnt/CD-FW/usr/
	cp -Rdp /mnt/usr/sbin /mnt/CD-FW/usr/
	cp -Rdp /mnt/usr/local/bin /mnt/CD-FW/usr/local/
	cp -Rdp /mnt/usr/lib /mnt/CD-FW/usr/
	cp -Rdp /mnt/usr/libexec /mnt/CD-FW/usr/
	cp -Rdp /mnt/usr/share /mnt/CD-FW/usr/
	cp -Rdp /mnt/usr/man /mnt/CD-FW/usr/
</verb>

I then need to create alot of other folders and files in /mnt/CD-FW in order
to get a fairly complete system.  Things in /mnt/CD-FW/var for instance will
often have to be created by hand in order to avoid copying alot of crap I don't
need.  Notice, however, that I don't copy any /dev files, since these files will
be on the ramdisk(when I get around to creating it).

Ok, so now we have /mnt/CD-FW.  To make this easy for you, this is
essentially the exact same thing that's present on the Sentry Firewall CDROM.
All I did was use the 'mkisofs' utility on /mnt/CD-FW.  So the stuff on the CD
is actually a copy of what's in the /mnt/CD-FW directory on my hard drive.

Having a separate, but unused Slackware system on /dev/hdb1 makes it easy
for me to install and upgrade packages as I need them.  For example, if I want
to use the upgradepkg utility to upgrade a package I get from ftp.slackware.com,
I can simply do something like the following:

<tscreen><verb>
root@mybox:&tilde;&num; cp /tmp/zlib.tar.gz /mnt
root@mybox:&tilde;&num; cd /mnt; chroot /mnt
root@mybox:/&num; upgradepkg zlib.tar.gz; exit
.....
</verb></tscreen>

Then, all I need to do is re-run the script mentioned above, the one that
copies all those files, to update the /mnt/CD-FW directory.


<newline>
<sect1> The RAMdisk Image
<p> That's all nifty, but now comes the hard part... making the ramdisk.  If you
take a look at the /isolinux directory on the CDROM, you will see a bunch of
files, one of them is called 'initrd.img' - there are several others as well,
such as isolinux.cfg, message.txt, and isolinux.bin.  These files are required
by isolinux in order to work properly.  Take a look at those files and the
documentation that comes with syslinux to get a better idea of what all that
does.  In any case, the 'initrd.img' file is, in fact, the compressed ramdisk
image.

To take a look at the image, do something like the following:
<tscreen><verb>
blah@wherever:&tilde;&dollar; cp /cdrom/isolinux/initrd.img /tmp/initrd.img.gz
blah@wherever:&tilde;&dollar; gzip -d /tmp/initrd.img.gz
blah@wherever:&tilde;&dollar; mount -o loop /tmp/initrd.img /MOUNT_POINT
</verb></tscreen>

In a nutshell, I use the file '/SENTRY/scripts/MK-CD/mkrootdsk.sh' to create
the rootdisk.  Please read that file and the disclaimer before you decide to
use it.  It runs perfectly on my system, but may not run well at all on yours.
It basically attempts to create a rootdisk image to use with the Sentry CD, but
it is very long and may be somewhat difficult to comprehend at times.  This is
what happens when I start a project and fail to utilize proper child safety
restraints.


<newline>
<sect1> Making the ISO Image
<p> The next file I use is called 'mkiso.sh'.  The script generally just
declares a few variables and runs the 'mkisofs' utility.  The command I normally
run looks like the following:

<tscreen><verb>
root@mybox:&tilde;&num; cd /mnt/CD-FW
root@mybox:/mnt/CD-FW&num; mkisofs -o sentrycd.iso -R -V &dquot;Sentry Firewall CD [v1.2.0]&dquot; -v \
   -T -d -D -N \
   -b isolinux/isolinux.bin \
   -c isolinux/eltorito.cat \
   -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table \
   -A &dquot;Sentry Firewall v1.2.0 (Slackware 8.0)&dquot;
........
</verb></tscreen>

And that's it, I burn the CD and test it.  For reference, the following
files are available on the CDROM:
<itemize>
 <item> /SENTRY/scripts/MK-CD/mkrootdsk.sh (builds the rootdisk)
 <item> /SENTRY/scripts/MK-CD/mkiso.sh     (builds final ISO image)
 <item> /SENTRY/scripts/MK-CD/record-cd.sh (burns the ISO to a CD)
</itemize>
