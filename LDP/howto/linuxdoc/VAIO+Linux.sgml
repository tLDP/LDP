This version of HOWTO is rewritten for updated information. HTML version

note; I just want know how this documents are used :)

<sect1>Notes about different systems
<p>
I've recently received some mail stating that some of contents in this
document is incorrect. It is because some reason, hardware installed on
more recent systems are slightly different than older systems. I will
start covering those information. But since of course, I don't have every
system in here, I would like to ask Sony VAIO owners to tell me more
information about it. This would help me a lot if you can put [VAIO
Information] in the beginning of the subject, so I can take extra
attention to it. Also, please include model number of the system. If it is
notebook, please include that information in a content, or in a subject. I
would like to apologize to ones that got confused by this document.

<sect1>Update History
<p>
12/29/98 Added several updates

<sect1>Disclaimer 
<p>
Also most of procedures in this document is tested, I will
take no responsibilities for any problem caused by using any information
in this document. As like in GPL, please try anything in your own risk. I
am not native English writer, and you will find many mistakes in this
document. Please excuse me on those. Any corrections and clarifications
are welcome; please send those to hideki@chatlink.com.

<sect1>What this document all about?
<p>
In this HOWTO, I will go over how to use Linux under Sony VAIO
computers. The VAIO computers are great, but was not very friendly to
Linux.  But this isn't mean that you cannot use it, actually you can!
Throughout this document, I will assume that you own either PCV 70 or 90.
Since almost all VAIO models are similar in their architecture (although
newer ones have larger disks, updated video card, more RAM, etc), many of
contents in this document should apply to all VAIO models.


<sect>Hardware compatibilities issue
<p>
<sect1>Hardware that not compatible with Linux
<p>
Most of hardwares installed in the system are compatible under
Linux. However there are exceptions of modem, USB Port and MPEG decoder.
Please be aware that you cannot use modem, which should be problem for
some of you. Modems installed in the VAIO is called DSVD modem, which is
the variant of the "Winmodem."

(Addition: 12/28/98)
Newer model seems to have normal modem instead of Winmodem.

<sect1>Partially compatible hardwares
<p>
The soundcard and the Video card installed are partially compatible.

<sect2>Soundcard
<p>
Soundcard is compatible under Linux with supports of Microsoft Sound
System + Sound Blaster, if you want to use MIDI under Linux, you need to
compromise your sound input capabilities.  For this case, cancel out the
Sound Blaster.  If you need MIDI, and sound input, you may want consider
buying OSS/Linux, which you can use all of its capabilities under Linux.
The soundcard equipped with the VAIO is Yamaha OPL3SA, and OSS/Linux has
full support to it.  It seems like that the wavetable synthesis mentioned
in the specification is really the soft synthesizer, so you are not
missing hardware capabilities on it. As the time I am writing this, there
is the OSS/Free 3.8, which supports
this soundcard under Yamaha OPL3-SA1 audio controller. Please note that
this is not initially installed on 2.0.x. You will need to download from
OSS site. 2.1.x comes with updated version of OSS/Free, but I haven't
tested compatibility with it. If you see that it is working with this
soundcard, please let me know.

<sect2>Video Card
<p>Videocard is partially supported under Linux.  You will have no
problem
using it under Linux console mode.  If you wish to use it under X Window,
get 3.3.1 or later XFree86, which has support to ATI Rage.  Other
commercial X Window system should support this, too.  However, 3D
acceleration of this video card will not work under Linux, as there is no
driver for this. (Update 12/29/98) For model number 505, ALSA drivers on
XFree86 V3.3.3 or later is compatible.

<sect>How to install Linux?
<p>
Installing Linux on the system will not be big problem.  However,
you
need to aware that initially, there are one non-DOS partition on the
system.  I have no idea what that partition is.  It is 400MB partition,
and it is visible by running fdisk.  I simply deleted this partition to
allocate it for Linux.  And I don't have any problem, so probably it must
be something to do with software installation. (Update 12/29/98) This
400MB partition is only on older models, it really supporsed to be another
400MB DOS partition, but Sony made mistake on it.  Please refer to other
instruction for general installation of Linux.  The VAIO has nice support
that you can boot directly from CD-ROM, if CD-ROM is bootable.  Since the BIOS
supports it, it is what you can use in some distribution.  This is nice,
because you can perform floppyless installation.  Particularly, Redhat
could boot from CD-ROM.  Other distribution like SUSE also claims that it
can boot from CD-ROM.  But as I have not checked those yet, I cannot be
sure on that. If that this way of booting does not work with yours, try
checking boot option in the BIOS.  Kernel configuration shouldn't be big
problem except for the part to setup soundcard.  But as I covered that
issue earlier, I will not talk about it in this section.  The VAIO
computer is equipped with APM BIOS, or Advanced Power Management BIOS, I
personally don't recommend that you enable support to it under Linux.  I
had problem when I enabled it. (Update 12/29/98) I have received report
that with 505, CD-ROM install is difficult and network install is much
easier. 

<sect>After all...
<p>
Everything went well?  I hope it did.  Now your Sony VAIO computer
is one of the best Linux workstation.  If you have any problem, I may have
answer to your questions.  Please just send those to hideki@chatlink.com
anytime.  I will try to answer those as soon as possible.
