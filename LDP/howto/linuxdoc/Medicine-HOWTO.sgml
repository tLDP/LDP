<sect1>About the Author(s)
<p>
Gerardo Arnaez: I am an internal medicine doctor. I am extremely concerned with the state of medical informatics. 
<p>
Werner Heuser: Working as a system administrator in the computer departments of two German hospitals I get inspired to search for medical applications created with Linux software. Besides this HOWTO I have written the <url url="http://mobilix.org/howtos.html" name="Linux-Mobile-Guide">, <url url="http://mobilix.org/howtos.html" name="Linux-Infrared-HOWTO"> and the <url url="http://mobilix.org/eco_linux.html" name="Linux-Ecology-HOWTO">.

<sect1>Good Electronic Health Record - GEHR
<p>
The <url url="http://www.gehr.org/" name="Good Electronic Health Record (GEHR)"> , a major part of the work of the openEHR Foundation, is an evolving electronic health record architecture designed to be comprehensive, portable and medico-legally robust. It has been developed from the <url url="http://www.chime.ucl.ac.uk/HealthI/GEHR/" name="Good European Health Record project"> requirements statement and object model- the most comprehensive requirements documents ever developed for the electronic health record. This website is a public resource for documents and resources that have been used to build implementations of this record.

<p>The main point of this site is to try to setup standards.

<sect1>Conversion of ECGs - ecg2png
<p>
<url url="http://www.cardiothink.com/downloads/ecg2png/" name="ecg2png"> converts scanned 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) into PNG format and a web-friendly image size. The problems this program solves are that an ECG scanned at relatively high resolution puts a large memory load on the Web browser because it contains about 6 million color pixels. Also, typical scanners convert a clean paper ECG into many colors, not just red, black, and white. The resulting file cannot be compressed efficiently and takes more time to transmit over low-speed network connections. This program shrinks the image while preserving the signal and cleans up the color map, yielding a bitmap that is well-suited for Web-based distribution of ECG images.

<sect1>Res Medicinae (German)
<p>
Probably in most countries, but for sure in Germany, about 80% of administrative software used in medical doctor's practices are still based on the antique DOS operating system. Slowly, programs using modern graphical user interfaces (GUI) reach a share of the market. Most of them is based on one of the buggy but nevertheless expensive MS WINDOWS operating systems.
<p>
When having bought a system, the user (doctor) is tied up to the provider and its updates that cost. Those are necessary due to steady changes in public health system and technical progress.
<p>
<url url="http://www.resmedicinae.org" name="Res Medicinae"> is the attempt to overcome high pricing in the realm of medical information systems and to provide users with a stable, platform independent, extensive system using latest technology and being open to many other medical systems.

<sect1>REALTIQ - ReAligning Tissue Quantifier
<p>
REALTIQ stands for <it>Re-aligning Tissue Quantification</it>, the software is currently in the alpha-stage. 
<p>
Software Features:
<itemize>
<item>Re-align any patient-scan to new arbitrary axes by tri-linear interpolation 
<item>Segmentation of long-bone tissue 
<item>Quantification of long-bone tissue 
<item>DICOM compatible 
</itemize>

<p>
Description: A pre-version of this software was developed for use in a study on the relations of the medullary-canal dimensions and the cortical-bone area at patients suffering from arthritic bone-disease. 
<p>
The problem with CAT data is, that if the model (in this case the hand/finger) is not properly aligned with the CAT axis, the cut-planes will only display a distorted view of the bone and quantitative measurement will yield high error-rates. 
<p>
REALTIQ reads in a set of DICOM images and displays it to the viewer as a frontal, sagittal and transversal view. The user can specify, intuitively by using the mouse, an axis through this data, as well as a bounding-box around that axis. The dataset will be mapped to that new axis, so that the structures of interest are now properly aligned. In a second step, the software calculates: 

<itemize>
<item>Medullary-canal diameters (in several directions) 
<item>Medullary-canal area / absorption rate 
<item>Cortical-bone diameters (in several directions) 
<item>Cortical-bone area / absorption rate 
</itemize>

[004] - BMI 1.0

About: BMI is a tool to help dieting people.  It calculates your Body Mass
Index (BMI) and gives you an indication of your fatness. It saves the
results in a file, so you can through the program look at the file, and
compare your results from one day to another. This gives you an overlook of
your weight development over a period of time.
