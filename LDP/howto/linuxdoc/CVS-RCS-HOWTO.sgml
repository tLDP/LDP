This document is a "practical guide" to very quickly setup CVS/RCS source code
control system. This document also has custom shell scripts which are wrappers on top of CVS. These scripts provide a easy user interface for CVS. The information in this document applies to Linux and as well as to all other flavors of Unix liks Solaris, HPUX, AIX, SCO, Sinix, BSD, SCO, etc..

<chapt>Introduction
-->
<sect>Introduction
<p>
Source code control system is a MUST to manage 
the changes occuring to software project during development. Developers need a complete history of changes
to backtrack to previous versions in case of any problems.
Since source code is the most vital component of any software project and  
software development takes a huge amount of time and money, it is very important to spend some 
time in <it><bf>safe-guarding</bf></it> the source code by using source code control systems like CVS and RCS.
<p>
CVS (Concurrent Version Control System) is a powerful tool which allows 
concurrent development of software by multiple users. It uses RCS 
underneath and has application layer interface as a wrapper on top RCS.

CVS can record the history of your files (usually,
but not always, source code). CVS only stores the differences
between versions, instead of every version of every file
you've ever created. CVS also keeps a log of who, when and
why changes occurred, among other aspects.

CVS is very helpful for managing releases and controlling
the concurrent editing of source files among multiple
authors. Instead of providing version control for a
collection of files in a single directory, CVS provides
version control for a hierarchical collection of
directories consisting of revision controlled files.

These directories and files can then be combined together
to form a software release.

CVS can be used for storing "C", "C++", Java, Perl, HTML and
other files.

<chapt> Which one is for me? CVS or RCS
-->
<sect> Which one is for me? CVS or RCS
<p>
CVS actually uses RCS underneath. CVS is a lot more powerful tool and
can control a complete source code tree. 
It is <it><bf>very strongly</bf></it> recommended that you use CVS, because you can greatly customize CVS with scripting languages like PERL, korn and bash shells. 
See the sample korn shell scripts at <ref id="Shell Scripts">.

Advantages of CVS
<itemize>
<item> CVS is de-centralised a user checks out files/directories 
from the repostitory
and has his own separate stable source directory tree.
<item> CVS can "STAMP" releases of entire project source tree.
<item> CVS can enable concurrent editing of files.
<item> CVS can be greatly customized to enable strong locking of files or
enable concurrent editing of files using shell scripts or PERL.
</itemize>

Disadvantages of CVS
<itemize>
<item> Needs a little more administration than RCS
<item> Very highly sophisticated and complex system. It is the "State of the Art" technology.
<item> Has a large number of commands and command options, hence a steeper 
learning curve for beginners. The shell scripts at <ref id="Shell Scripts"> can ease usage.
</itemize>

Advantages of RCS
<itemize>
<item> RCS is very simple to setup, with less administrative work.
<item> RCS is used in a centralized area where everyone works. 
<item> RCS is useful for simple systems.
<item> Very strong locking of files - concurrency eliminated.
</itemize>

Downside of RCS
<itemize>
<item> Concurrent development by multiple developers is not possible due to file locking and being limited to a single working directory. Because of the single working directory limitation changes to files by multiple developers can cause failure of the 'make' command.
<item> Cannot stamp releases of an entire software project.
</itemize>

This document also has 
shell scripts which provide
simple commands to check-out, check-in, commit files.
See shell scripts at <ref id="Shell Scripts">

For RCS see the RCS mini-howto on the linux cdrom -
<CODE>
cd /mnt/cdrom/Redhat/RPMS
ls -l howto-6.0-*.noarch.rpm
rpm -qpl howto-6* | grep -i rcs 
</CODE>
or visit <url url="http://www.LinuxDoc.org/HOWTO/mini/RCS.html">

<chapt> Setting up CVS <label id="Setting up CVS">
-->
<sect> Setting up CVS <label id="Setting up CVS">
<p>
First you need to install the CVS package, on Redhat linux use
<CODE>
cd /mnt/cdrom/Redhat/RPMS
rpm -i rcs*.rpm
rpm -i cvs*.rpm
To see the list of files installed do -
rpm -qpl cvs*.rpm | less
</CODE>
and browse output using j,k, CTRL+f, CTRL+D, CTRL+B, CTRL+U or using arrow keys, page up/down keys.
See 'man less'.

On other flavors of unix, you may need to download the RCS and CVS tar balls
and follow README, INSTALL files to setup CVS.
Visit <url url="http://www.cyclic.com">
and <url url="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs-index.html">

-->
<sect1> Environment variables <label id="CVS-Env">
<p>
The following environment variables need to be setup in /etc/profile - default values required for all users.
If not set in /etc/profile, than you should add these to your local profile file ~/.bash_profile.
<CODE>
export EDITOR=/bin/vi
export CVSROOT=/home/cvsroot
export CVSREAD=yes
</CODE>

Create a directory to store the source code repository and give read, write access to unix group/user.
<CODE>
export CVSROOT=/home/cvsroot
mkdir $CVSROOT
chmod o-rwx $CVSROOT
chmod ug+rwx $CVSROOT
</CODE>
To initialize the CVS and to put in source code files do -
<CODE>
cvs init

# Change directory is a must
cd $HOME/my_source_code_dir

# Must give vendor tag and revision tag
cvs import my_source_code_dir V1_0 R1_0  

</CODE>

<sect1> Migrate RCS to CVS <label id="RCS2CVS">
<p>
To migrate the existing RCS files to CVS, use the following script. Make sure
that you installed korn shell package pdksh*.rpm from Linux contrib cdrom.

<bf>NOTE : <it>Korn shell /bin/ksh is obtained by installing pdksh*.rpm from Linux contrib cdrom</it></bf>
<CODE>
#!/bin/ksh

#############################################################
# Program to Migrate the existing source code in RCS to CVS 
#
# Needs the korn shell RPM package  pdksh*.rpm from Linux 
# contrib cdrom
#############################################################

#
# rcs2cvs - convert source tree from RCS to CVS
#

# project to convert
PROJECT='project'

# current RCS root
RCSROOT="$HOME/rcs"

if cd "$RCSROOT/$PROJECT"
then
	cd "$RCSROOT"
else
	echo >&2 "`basename "$0"`: can't change to RCS directory '$RCSROOT/$PROJECT'."
	exit 1
fi

# current CVS root
CVSROOT="$HOME/cvs"

# create new CVS directory for project 'project'
if mkdir "$CVSROOT/$PROJECT"
then
	:
else
	echo >&2 "`basename "$0"`: can't create CVS directory '$CVSROOT/$PROJECT'."
	exit 2
fi

# create CVS project tree from RCS tree
find "$PROJECT" -type d -name RCS -print |
while read RCS
do
	CVS="`dirname "$RCS"`"
	(if cd "$RCS"
	then
#		if find . -type f -name '*,v' -print | cpio -pdmv "$CVSROOT/$CVS"
		if find . -type f -print | cpio -pdmv "$CVSROOT/$CVS"
		then
			:
		else
			echo >&2 "`basename "$0"`: can't convert RCS subdirectory '$RCSROOT/$RCS' to CVS subdirectory '$CVSROOT/$CVS'."
		fi
	else
		echo >&2 "`basename "$0"`: can't change to RCS subdirectory '$RCSROOT/$RCS'."
	fi)
done
</CODE>
Now the RCS is migrated to CVS as 'project'. You can start using the
CVS commands on module 'project'.

<chapt> Shell Scripts <label id="Shell Scripts">
-->
<sect> Shell Scripts <label id="Shell Scripts">
<p>
The following are wrappers around the basic CVS commands. The scripts are written for Korn shell since korn shell is always available on all flavors of unixes, but you can translate to bash or PERL if needed. You can customize
these scrips to your taste. They are basically CVS commands but features are
added to make it site specific. For example, sedit script provides locking
so that users will know some-one is editing the file. Of course users can 
directly use the CVS commands to by-pass these scripts. These scripts demonstrate how CVS can be customized to a great extent.

Copy these scripts to /usr/local/bin and this should be in the user's PATH environment.
<enum>
<item> <bf>sget</bf> &lsqb;-r revision_number&rsqb; &lt;file/directory name&gt;
	To get a file or entire directory from CVS in READ ONLY mode.
	Click <ref id="sget">

<item> <bf>sedit</bf> &lsqb;-r revision_number&rsqb; &lt;filename&gt;
	To edit a file in order to make changes to code. This will lock the
	file so that nobody else can checkout. Ofcourse you can change the script to your requirement - make no locking, warning message or very strong locking.
	Click <ref id="sedit">

<item> <bf>scommit</bf> &lsqb;-r revision_number&rsqb; &lt;filename&gt;
	To commit the changes you made to filename or entire 
	directory. Upload your changes to CVS
	Click <ref id="scommit">

<item> <bf>supdate</bf>	&lt;filename/directory&gt; 
	To update a filename or to update a entire directory by 
	getting the latest files from CVS
	Click <ref id="supdate">

<item> <bf>sunlock</bf> &lsqb;-r revision_number&rsqb; &lt;filename&gt;
	To unlock the file got by sedit. Will release the lock.
	Click <ref id="sunlock">

<item> <bf>slist</bf>	
	To see the list of files currently being edited by you. 
	Does 'ls -l | grep | ...' command.
	Click <ref id="slist">

<item> <bf>sinfo</bf> &lt;filename/directory&gt; 
	To get the information of changes/revisions to a file 
	Click <ref id="sinfo">

<item> <bf>slog</bf> &lt;filename&gt; 
	To get the history of changes/revisions to a file from CVS
	Click <ref id="slog">

<item> <bf>sdif</bf> &lt;filename&gt;
<p><bf>sdif</bf> -r rev1 -r rev2 &lt;filename&gt; 
	To get the diff of your file with CVS.
	Click <ref id="sdif">

	NOTE: sdif has only one 'f' because there is already another 
		unix command called 'sdiff'

<item> <bf>sadd</bf> &lt;filename&gt;   
	To add a new file to CVS repository
	Click <ref id="sadd">

<item> <bf>sdelete</bf>	&lt;filename&gt; 
	To delete a file from CVS repository
	Click <ref id="sdelete">

<item> <bf>sfreeze</bf>	&lt;revision name&gt; &lt;directory name&gt;
	To freeze the code, that is make release of entire source tree.
	Click <ref id="sfreeze">

<item> <bf>saddtree</bf> &lt;revision name&gt; &lt;directory name&gt;
	To add a directory tree to CVS.
	Click <ref id="saddtree">
<p>
	For example : 
<code>
	cd $HOME;   
	sfreeze REVISION_1_0  srctree  
</code>
 	   This will freeze code with tag REVISION_1_0  so that you can later 
	   checkout the entire tree by using with revision name

The document is written using a tool called "SGML-Tools" which can be got from - 
<url url="http://www.sgmltools.org">
Compiling the source you will get the following commands like
<itemize>
<item>sgml2html CVS-HOWTO.sgml     (to generate html file)
<item>sgml2rtf  CVS-HOWTO.sgml     (to generate RTF file)
<item>sgml2latex CVS-HOWTO.sgml    (to generate latex file)
</itemize>

LaTeX documents may be converted into PDF files simply by 
producing a Postscript output using <bf>sgml2latex</bf> ( and dvips) and running the
output through the Acrobat <bf>distill</bf> (<url url="http://www.adobe.com">) command as follows: 
<code>
bash$ man sgml2latex
bash$ sgml2latex filename.sgml
bash$ man dvips
bash$ dvips -o filename.ps filename.dvi
bash$ distill filename.ps
bash$ man ghostscript
bash$ man ps2pdf
bash$ ps2pdf input.ps output.pdf
bash$ acroread output.pdf &
</code>
Or you can use Ghostscript command <bf>ps2pdf</bf>.
ps2pdf is a work-alike for nearly all the functionality of 
Adobe's Acrobat Distiller product: it
converts PostScript files to Portable Document Format (PDF) files. 
<bf>ps2pdf</bf> is implemented as a very small command script (batch file) that invokes Ghostscript, selecting a special "output device"
called <bf>pdfwrite</bf>. In order to use ps2pdf, the pdfwrite device must be included in the makefile when Ghostscript was compiled;
see the documentation on building Ghostscript for details.
