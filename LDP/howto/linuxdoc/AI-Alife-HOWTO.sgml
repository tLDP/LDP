<abstract>
This howto mainly contains information about, and links to,
various AI related software libraries, applications, etc. 
that work on the GNU/Linux platform. All of it is (at least) 
free for personal use. 

The new master page for this document is

<sect>Introduction
<p>

<sect1>Purpose
<p>

The GNU/Linux OS has evolved from its origins in hackerdom to a full
blown UNIX, capable of rivaling any commercial UNIX.  It now provides
an inexpensive base to build a great workstation.  It has shed its
hardware dependencies, having been ported to DEC Alphas, Sparcs,
PowerPCs, and many others.  This potential speed boost along with its
networking support will make it great for workstation clusters.  As a
workstation it allows for all sorts of research and development,
including artificial intelligence and artificial life.


The purpose of this Mini-Howto is to provide a source to find out
about various software packages, code libraries, and anything else
that will help someone get started working with (and find resources
for) artificial intelligence, artificial life, etc.  All done with 
GNU/Linux specifically in mind.


<sect1>Where to find this software
<p>

All this software should be available via the net (ftp || http).  The
links to where to find it will be provided in the description of each
package.  There will also be plenty of software not covered on these
pages (which is usually platform independent) located on one of the 
resources listed on the <htmlurl url="http://zhar.net/gnu-linux/howto/links/"
name="links section"> of the Master Site (given above).

 
<sect1>Updates and comments
<p> 

If you find any mistakes, know of updates to one of the items below,
or have problems compiling any of the applications, please mail me at:
<htmlurl url="mailto:jae@NOSPAM-zhar.net" name="jae@NOSPAM-zhar.net"> 
and I'll see what I can do.  


If you know of any AI/Alife applications, class libraries,
etc. <bf>Please</bf> <htmlurl url="mailto:jae@NOSPAM-zhar.net" name=" email me">
about them. Include your name, ftp and/or http sites where they can be
found, plus a brief overview/commentary on the software (this info
would make things a lot easier on me... but don't feel obligated ;).

 
I know that keeping this list up to date and expanding it will take quite
a bit of work. So please be patient (I do have other projects). I hope you 
will find this document helpful.

   <sect>Traditional Artificial Intelligence
    <p>
	Traditional AI is based around the ideas of logic, rule
	systems, linguistics, and the concept of rationality.  At its
	roots are programming languages such as Lisp and Prolog.
	Expert systems are the largest successful example of this
	paradigm.  An expert system consists of a detailed knowledge
	base and a complex rule system to utilize it.  Such systems
	have been used for such things as medical diagnosis support
	and credit checking systems.

     
    <sect1>AI class/code libraries
<p>

    These are libraries of code or classes for use in programming within
    the artificial intelligence field.  They are not meant as stand alone
    applications, but rather as tools for building your own applications.

	Basically, the library offers the programmer a set of search
	algorithms that may be used to solve all kind of different
	problems. The idea is that when developing problem solving software
	the programmer should be able to concentrate on the representation of
	the problem to be solved and should not need to bother with the
	implementation of the search algorithm that will be used to actually
	conduct the search. This idea has been realized by the implementation
	of a set of search classes that may be incorporated in other software
	through <bf>C++</bf>'s features of derivation and inheritance.  The
	following search algorithms have been implemented:
	

	- depth-first tree and graph search.
	- breadth-first tree and graph search.
	- uniform-cost tree and graph search.
	- best-first search.
	- bidirectional depth-first tree and graph search.
	- bidirectional breadth-first tree and graph search.
	- AND/OR depth tree search.
	- AND/OR breadth tree search.

        QUANT/1 stands for type QUANTifier. It aims to be an alternative to
        Prolog-like (Resulutional-like) systems. Main features include a lack
        of necessity for eliminating Quantifiers, scolemisation, ease of
        comprehension, large scale formulae operation, acceptance of nonHorn
        formulaes, and Iterative deeping. The actual library implemented in
        this project is called ATPPCF (Automatic Theorem Prover in calculus of
        Positively Constructed Formulae).

        ATPPCF will be a library (inference engine) and an extension of the
        Predicate Calculus Language as a new logical language. The library will
        be incorporable in another software such as TCL, Python, Perl. The
        engine's primary inference method will be the "search of inference in
        language of Positively Constructed Formulas (PCFs)" (a subset of
        Predicate Calculus well translated in both directions). The language
        will be used as scripting language to the engine. But there will be
        possibility to replace it with extensions languages of main software.

      Screamer is an extension of Common Lisp that adds support for
      nondeterministic programming. Screamer consists of two
      levels. The basic nondeterministic level adds support for
      backtracking and undoable side effects.  On top of this
      nondeterministic substrate, Screamer provides a comprehensive
      constraint programming language in which one can formulate and
      solve mixed systems of numeric and symbolic
      constraints. Together, these two levels augment Common Lisp with
      practically all of the functionality of both Prolog and
      constraint logic programming languages such as CHiP and CLP(R).
      Furthermore, Screamer is fully integrated with Common
      Lisp. Screamer programs can coexist and interoperate with other
      extensions to Common Lisp such as CLOS, CLIM and Iterate.

	ASA (Adaptive Simulated Annealing) is a powerful global
	optimization C-code algorithm especially useful for nonlinear and/or
	stochastic systems.
	

        ASA is developed to statistically find the best global fit of a
        nonlinear non-convex cost-function over a D-dimensional space. This
        algorithm permits an annealing schedule for 'temperature' T decreasing
        exponentially in annealing-time k, T = T&lowbar;0 exp(-c k&circ;1/D).
        The introduction of re-annealing also permits adaptation to changing
        sensitivities in the multi-dimensional parameter-space. This annealing
        schedule is faster than fast Cauchy annealing, where T = T&lowbar;0/k,
        and much faster than Boltzmann annealing, where T = T&lowbar;0/ln k.

      and/or object based expert systems.  
      
 
      CLIPS provides a cohesive tool for handling a wide variety of
      knowledge with support for three different programming paradigms:
      rule-based, object-oriented and procedural.  Rule-based programming
      allows knowledge to be represented as heuristics, or "rules of thumb,"
      which specify a set of actions to be performed for a given
      situation. Object-oriented programming allows complex systems to be
      modeled as modular components (which can be easily reused to model
      other systems or to create new components).  The procedural
      programming capabilities provided by CLIPS are similar to capabilities
      found in languages such as C, Pascal, Ada, and LISP.

      FUF is an extended implementation of the formalism of functional
      unification grammars (FUGs) introduced by Martin Kay specialized to
      the task of natural language generation. It adds the following
      features to the base formalism:
      <itemize>	
        <item>Types and inheritance. 
	    <item>Extended control facilities (goal freezing, intelligent backtracking). 
	    <item>Modular syntax.
      </itemize>
      These extensions allow the development of large grammars which can be
      processed efficiently and can be maintained and understood more
      easily.  SURGE is a large syntactic realization grammar of English
      written in FUF. SURGE is developed to serve as a black box syntactic
      generation component in a larger generation system that encapsulates a

        Isabelle is a popular generic theorem prover developed at Cambridge
        University and TU Munich. Existing logics like Isabelle/HOL provide a
        theorem proving environment ready to use for sizable applications.
        Isabelle may also serve as framework for rapid prototyping of deductive
        systems. It comes with a large library including Isabelle/HOL
        (classical higher-order logic), Isabelle/HOLCF (Scott's Logic for
        Computable Functions with HOL), Isabelle/FOL (classical and
        intuitionistic first-order logic), and Isabelle/ZF (Zermelo-Fraenkel

	Neural Networks, Semantic Networks and a few other similar
	ideas. My present focus is on neural networks (though I am
	looking for resources on the other techniques). Neural
	networks are programs designed to simulate the workings of the
	brain. They consist of a network of small mathematical-based
	nodes, which work together to form patterns of information.
	They have tremendous potential and currently seem to be having
	a great deal of success with image processing and robot
	control.

	been on code clarity and providing high level programming
	abstractions. It thus is very suitable for experimental
	implementations which need or extend belief network
	technology.

	At the highest level, IDEAL can be used as a subroutine
	library which provides belief network inference and influence
	diagram evaluation as a package. The code is documented in a
	detailed manual and so it is also possible to work at a lower
	level on extensions of belief network methods.
 
	IDEAL comes with an optional graphic interface written in
	CLIM. If your Common Lisp also has CLIM, you can run the

      A C++ artificial neual net library.  Spiderweb2 is a complete
      rewrite of the original Spiderweb library, it has grown into a
      much more flexible and object-oriented system. The biggest
      change is that each neuron object is responsible for its own
      activations and updates, with the network providing only the
      scheduling aspect. This is a very powerful change, and it allows
      easy modification and experimentation with various network
      architectures and neuron types.

      GENESIS (short for GEneral NEural SImulation System) is a
      general purpose simulation platform which was developed to
      support the simulation of neural systems ranging from complex
      models of single neurons to simulations of large networks made
      up of more abstract neuronal components. GENESIS has provided
      the basis for laboratory courses in neural simulation at both
      Caltech and the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA,
      as well as several other institutions. Most current GENESIS
      applications involve realistic simulations of biological neural
      systems. Although the software can also model more abstract
      networks, other simulators are more suitable for backpropagation
      and similar connectionist modeling.

      The Neural Network Generator is a genetic algorithm for the
      topological optimization of feedforward neural networks. It
      implements the Semantic Changing Genetic Algorithm and the
      Unit-Cluster Model. The Semantic Changing Genetic Algorithm is
      an extended genetic algorithm that allows fast dynamic
      adaptation of the genetic coding through population
      analysis. The Unit-Cluster Model is an approach to the
      construction of modular feedforward networks with a ''backbone''
      structure. 
      

      NOTE: To compile this on Linux requires one change in the Makefiles. 
      You will need to change '-ltermlib' to '-ltermcap'.

      nn is a high-level neural network specification language. The
      current version is best suited for feed-forward nets, but
      recurrent models can and have been implemented, e.g. Hopfield
      nets, Jordan/Elman nets, etc.  In nn, it is easy to change
      network dynamics. The nn compiler can generate C code or
      executable programs (so there must be a C compiler available),
      with a powerful command line interface (but everything may also
      be controlled via the graphical interface, xnn). It is possible
      for the user to write C routines that can be called from inside
      the nn specification, and to use the nn specification as a
      function that is called from a C program. Please note that no
      programming is necessary in order to use the network models that
      come with the system (`netpack').  
      
 
      xnn is a graphical front end to networks generated by the nn
      compiler, and to the compiler itself. The xnn graphical
      interface is intuitive and easy to use for beginners, yet
      powerful, with many possibilities for visualizing network data.
      
 
      NOTE: You have to run the install program that comes with this
      to get the license key installed. It gets put (by default) in
      /usr/lib. If you (like myself) want to install the package
      somewhere other than in the /usr directory structure (the
      install program gives you this option) you will have to set up
      some environmental variables (NNLIBDIR & NNINCLUDEDIR are
      required). You can read about these (and a few other optional
      variables) in appendix A of the documentation (pg 113).

      membrane properties into these sections (including channels,
      synapses, ionic concentrations, and counters). The interface was
      designed to present the neural modeler with a intuitive
      environment and hide the details of the numerical methods used

      As the field of Connectionist modeling has grown, so has the need
      for a comprehensive simulation environment for the development and
      testing of Connectionist models. Our goal in developing PDP++ has been
      to integrate several powerful software development and user interface
      tools into a general purpose simulation environment that is both user
      friendly and user extensible. The simulator is built in the C++
      programming language, and incorporates a state of the art script
      interpreter with the full expressive power of C++. The graphical user
      interface is built with the Interviews toolkit, and allows full access
      to the data structures and processing modules out of which the
      simulator is built. We have constructed several useful graphical
      modules for easy interaction with the structure and the contents of
      neural networks, and we've made it possible to change and adapt many
      things. At the programming level, we have set things up in such a way
      as to make user extensions as painless as possible. The programmer
      creates new C++ objects, which might be new kinds of units or new
      kinds of processes; once compiled and linked into the simulator, these
      new objects can then be accessed and used like any other.

      The semnet.py module defines several simple classes for
      building and using semantic networks.  A semantic network is a
      way of representing knowledge, and it enables the program to
      do simple reasoning with very little effort on the part of the
      programmer.
      

      The following classes are defined:
      <itemize>    	
        <item><bf>Entity</bf>: This class represents a noun; it is
	        something which can be related to other things, and about
	        which you can store facts.
	    <item><bf>Relation</bf>: A Relation is a type of relationship
	        which may exist between two entities.  One special relation,
	        "IS&lowbar;A", is predefined because it has special meaning (a sort
	        of logical inheritance).
	    <item><bf>Fact</bf>: A Fact is an assertion that a relationship 
	        exists between two entities.
      </itemize>
      <p>

      With these three object types, you can very quickly define knowledge 
      about a set of objects, and query them for logical conclusions.

    <sect>Evolutionary Computing
    <p>
	Evolutionary computing is actually a broad term for a vast
	array of programming techniques, including genetic algorithms,
	complex adaptive systems, evolutionary programming, etc.
	The main thrust of all these techniques is the idea of
	evolution. The idea that a program can be written that will
	<it>evolve</it> toward a certain goal.  This goal can be
	anything from solving some engineering problem to winning a
	game.

     
    <sect1>EC class/code libraries
    <p>
    
    These are libraries of code or classes for use in programming within
    the evolutionary computation field.  They are not meant as stand alone
    applications, but rather as tools for building your own applications.

        daga is an experimental release of a 2-level genetic algorithm  
        compatible with the GALOPPS GA software. It is a meta-GA which
        dynamically evolves a population of GAs to solve a problem presented to
        the lower-level GAs. When multiple GAs (with different operators,
        parameter settings, etc.) are simultaneously applied to the same
        problem, the ones showing better performance have a higher probability
        of surviving and "breeding" to the next macro-generation (i.e.,
        spawning new "daughter"-GAs with characteristics inherited from the
        parental GA or GAs.  In this way, we try to encourage good  
        problem-solving strategies to spread to the whole population of GAs.

      GAS is freeware.

      Purpose of GAS is to explore and exploit artificial evolutions.
      Primary implementation language of GAS is Python.  The GAS
      software package is meant to be a Python framework for applying
      genetic algorithms. It contains an example application where it
      is tried to breed Python program strings.  This special problem
      falls into the category of Genetic Programming (GP), and/or
      Automatic Programming.  Nevertheless, GAS tries to be useful for
      other applications of Genetic Algorithms as well.

      This is a new scheduler, called Evolution Scheduler, based on
      Genetic Algorithms and Evolutionary Programming. It lives with
      original Linux priority scheduler.This means you don't have to
      reboot to change the scheduling policy. You may simply use the
      manager program esep to switch between them at any time, and
      esep itself is an all-in-one for scheduling status, commands,
      and administration. We didn't intend to remove the original
      priority scheduler; instead, at least, esep provides you with
      another choice to use a more intelligent scheduler, which
      carries out natural competition in an easy and effective way.
      

      Xesep is a graphical user interface to the esep (Evolution
      Scheduling and Evolving Processes). It's intended to show users
      how to start, play, and feel the Evolution Scheduling and
      Evolving Processes, including sub-programs to display system
      status, evolving process status, queue status, and evolution
      scheduling status periodically in as small as one mini-second.

    <sect>Alife &amp; Complex Systems
    <p> 

    Alife takes yet another approach to exploring the mysteries of
    intelligence.  It has many aspects similar to EC and Connectionism, but
    takes these ideas and gives them a meta-level twist. Alife emphasizes the
    development of intelligence through <it>emergent</it> behavior of
    <it>complex adaptive systems</it>.  Alife stresses the social or group
    based aspects of intelligence. It seeks to understand life and survival. By
    studying the behaviors of groups of 'beings' Alife seeks to discover the
    way intelligence or higher order activity emerges from seemingly simple
    individuals. Cellular Automata and Conway's Game of Life are probably the
    most commonly known applications of this field. Complex Systems
    (abbreviated CS) are very similar to alife in the way the are approached,
    just more general in definition (ie.  alife is a type of complex system).
    Usually complex system software takes the form of a simulator.

     
    <sect1>Alife &amp; CS class/code libraries

    These are libraries of code or classes for use in programming within

        The Integrating Modelling Toolkit (IMT) is a generic, comprehensive,
        and extensible set of abstractions allowing definition and use of
        interoperable model components.  Modellers create an IMT "world" made
        of IMT "agents" that will perform each a particular phase of a
        modelling task.  The core set of IMT agents can describe generic,
        modular, distributed model components, either native to the IMT or
        integrating existing simulation toolkits, specialized for tasks that
        range from simple calculation of functions in an interpreted language
        to spatially explicit simulation, model optimization, GIS analysis,
        visualization and advanced statistical analysis.  IMT agents are
        designed to easily "glue" together in higher-level simulations
        integrating different modelling paradigms and toolkits.  The IMT can be
        easily extended by users and developers through a convenient plug-in

	environment proposed by von Neumann both computing and constructive
	universality can be achieved.  Von Neumann proved that in his cellular
	lattice both a Turing machine and a machine capable of producing any
	other cell assembly, when fed with a suitable program, can be
	embedded. He called the latter machine a ''universal
	constructor'' and showed that, when provided with a program
	containing its own description, this is capable of self-reproducing.

        The computer program avida is an auto-adaptive genetic system designed
        primarily for use as a platform in Artificial Life research. The avida
        system is based on concepts similar to those employed by the tierra
        program, that is to say it is a population of self-reproducing strings
        with a Turing-complete genetic basis subjected to Poisson-random
        mutations. The population adapts to the combination of an intrinsic
        fitness landscape (self-reproduction) and an externally imposed
        (extrinsic) fitness function provided by the researcher. By studying 
        this system, one can examine evolutionary adaptation, general traits of
        living systems (such as self-organization), and other issues pertaining
        to theoretical or evolutionary biology and dynamic systems.

        This program is similiar to "Conway's Game of Life" but yet it is very
        different. It takes "Conway's Game of Life" and applies it to a society
        (human society). This means there is a very different (and much larger)
        ruleset than in the original game. Things need to be taken into account
        such as the terrain, age, sex, culture, movement, etc

        Langton's Ant is an example of a finite-state cellular automata. The
        ant (or ants) start out on a grid. Each cell is either black or white.
        If the ant is on a black square, it turns right 90 and moves forward
        one unit. If the ant is on a white square, it turns left 90 and moves
        forward one unit.  And when the ant leaves a square, it inverts the
        color. The neat thing about Langton's Ant is that no matter what
        pattern field you start it out on, it eventually builds a "road," which
        is a series of 117 steps that repeat indefinitely, each time leaving
        the ant displaced one pixel vertically and horizontally.

      The program may be started with one or more organisms seeding
      the soup. Alternatively, the system may be started "sterile",
      with no organisms present. Spontaneous generation of
      self-reproducing organisms has been observed after runs as short

      passing on "good family values".
      

      The brain of a TIN can be seen as a collection of processes, each
      representing drives or impulses to behave a certain way, depending on
      the state/perception of the environment ( e.g. presence of food,
      walls, neighbors, scent traces) These behavior process currently are
      : eating, moving, mating, relaxing, tracing others, gathering food and
      killing. The process with the highest impulse value takes control, or
      in other words: the tin will act according to its most urgent need.

	Also known as intelligent software agents or just agents, this
	area of AI research deals with simple applications of small
	programs that aid the user in his/her work. They can be mobile
	(able to stop their execution on one machine and resume it on
	another) or static (live in one machine). They are usually
	specific to the task (and therefore fairly simple) and meant
	to help the user much as an assistant would. The most popular
	(ie. widely known) use of this type of application to date are
	the web robots that many of the indexing engines

      An aglet is a Java object that can move from one host on the
      Internet to another.  That is, an aglet that executes on one host can
      suddenly halt execution, dispatch to a remote host, and resume
      execution there. When the aglet moves, it takes along its program code
      as well as its state (data). A built-in security mechanism makes it
      safe for a computer to host untrusted aglets. The Java Aglet API
      (J-AAPI) is a proposed public standard for interfacing aglets and
      their environment. J-AAPI contains methods for initializing an aglet,
      message handling, and dispatching, retracting,
      deactivating/activating, cloning, and disposing of the aglet. J-AAPI
      is simple, flexible, and stable. Application developers can write
      platform-independent aglets and expect them to run on any host that
      supports J-AAPI.

        other chat robot languages, AIML is perhaps the simplest. The pattern
        matching language is very simple, for example permitting only one
        wild-card ('*') match character per pattern. AIML is an XML language,
        implying that it obeys certain grammatical meta-rules. The choice of
        XML syntax permits integration with other tools such as XML editors.
        Another motivation for XML is its familiar look and feel, especially to

      A transportable agent is a program that can migrate from machine
      to machine in a heterogeneous network.  The program chooses when and
      where to migrate.  It can suspend its execution at an arbitrary point,
      transport to another machine and resume execution on the new machine.
      For example, an agent carrying a mail message migrates first to a
      router and then to the recipient's mailbox.  The agent can perform
      arbitrarily complex processing at each machine in order to ensure that
      the message reaches the intended recipient.

        course) and lots of other things. The game server manages the game and
        the rules.  You start a server and connect some clients.  The clients
        communicate with the server using a very primitive protocol.  They can
        order cyborgs to harvest grain, attack enemies or cut forest.  The game
        is not intended to be played by humans!  There is too much to control.
        Only for die-hards: Just telnet to the server and you can enter
        commands by hand.  Instead the idea is that you write artificial  
        intelligence clients to beat the other artificial intelligences.  You
        can choose a language (and operating system) of your choice to do that
        task.  It is enough to write a program that communicates on standard
        input and standard output channels.  Then you can use programs like
        "socket" to connect your clients to the server.  It is NOT needed to
        write TCP/IP code, although i did so :) The battle shall not be boring,

        The Inter-Agent Communication Model (ICM) is a communication mechanism
        that can be used for sending messages between agents in an asynchronous
        fashion. Its intended application area is as a transportation mechanism
        for agent communication languages (ACLs), such as KQML and FIPA's ACL.

        Jacomma is an agent development platform/framework for developing
        distributed, mobile, and reactive information agents with heterogeneous
        communication capabilities, in Java and JPython.

        Jacomma provides a development framework and an execution environment,
        which sits on top of the Inter-Agent Communication Model
        infrastructure. The ICM defines a communication protocol, a store and
        forward messaging architecture, and low level communication
        infrastructure for message exchange.  Communication is truly
        asynchronous, based on TCP sockets.

        JAM supports both top-down, goal-based reasoning and bottom-up
        data-driven reasoning. JAM selects goals and plans based on maximal
        priority if metalevel reasoning is not used, or user-developed
        metalevel reasoning plans if they exist. JAM's conceptualization of
        goals and goal achievement is more classically defined (UMPRS is more
        behavioral performance-based than truly goal-based) and makes the
        distinction between plans to achieve goals and plans that simply encode
        behaviors. Goal-types implemented include achievement (attain a
        specified world state), maintenance (re-attain a specified world
        state), and performance. Execution of multiple simultaneous goals are
        supported, with suspension and resumption capabilities for each goal
        (i.e., intention) thread. JAM plans have explicit precondition and
        runtime attributes that restrict their applicability, a postcondition
        attribute, and a plan attributes section for specifying 
        plan/domain-specific plan features. Available plan constructs include:
        sequencing, iteration, subgoaling, atomic (i.e., non-interruptable)
        plan segments, n-branch deterministic and non-deterministic conditional
        execution, parallel execution of multiple plan segments, goal-based or
        world state-based synchronization, an explicit failure-handling
        section, and Java primitive function definition through building it
        into JAM as well as the invocation of predefined (i.e., legacy) class
        members via Java's reflection capabilities without having to build it
        into JAM.

      The JAT provides a fully functional template, written entirely in
      the Java language, for constructing software agents which communicate
      peer-to-peer with a community of other agents distributed over the
      Internet. Although portions of the code which define each agent are
      portable, JAT agents are not migratory but rather have a static
      existence on a single host. This behavior is in contrast to many other
      "agent" technologies. (However, using the Java RMI, JAT agents could
      dynamically migrate to a foreign host via an agent resident on that
      host).  Currently, all agent messages use KQML as a top-level protocol
      or message wrapper. The JAT includes functionality for dynamically
      exchanging "Resources", which can include Java classes (e.g. new
      languages and interpreters, remote services, etc.), data files and
      information inlined into the KQML messages.

      flexible, extendable, and easy-to-use java class library for
      programmers who are familiar with distributed programming. It
      is based on Java's RMI and has the following added features:
      <itemize>
    	<item>Runtime Reflection:
	        Agents can modify their behaviour (program codes) at
            runtime. The behaviour of the agent is represented by an
	        abstract class Action. It is useful for remote maintenance or
	        installation services.
	    <item>Remote Evaluation:
	        Agents can receive and evaluate program codes (classes)
	        with or without the serialized object. Remote evaluation is a
	        fundamental function of a mobile agent and is thought to be a
	        push model of service delivery.
	    <item>Distributed Name Service:
	        Agents have any number of logical names that don't contain the host
	        name. These names can be managed by the distributed directories.
	    <item>Customizable security policy:
	        a very flexible, customizable, 3-layered security model is
	        implemented in Kafka.
	    <item>100&percnt; Java and RMI compatible:
	        Kafka is written completely in Java. Agent is a Java RMI
	        server object itself. So, agents can directly communicate with
	        other RMI objects.

      by the user or another agent. They have the ability to roam a
      network of "locations" autonomously. These "locations" are an
      abstraction of real, existing nodes in the underlying
      network. They can use location-specific resources by
      communicating with dedicated agents representing these
      services. Agents are able to use services provided by other
      agents and to provide services as well.

      TclRobots is a programming game, similar to 'Core War'.  To play
      TclRobots, you must write a Tcl program that controls a robot.  The
      robot's mission is to survive a battle with other robots.  Two, three,
      or four robots compete during a battle, each running different
      programs (or possibly the same program in different robots.)  Each
      robot is equipped with a scanner, cannon, drive mechanism.  A single
      match continues until one robot is left running.  Robots may compete
      individually, or combine in a team oriented battle.  A tournament
      can be run with any number of robot programs, each robot playing every
      other in a round-robin fashion, one-on-one.  A battle simulator is
      available to help debug robot programs.
      

      The TclRobots program provides a physical environment, imposing
      certain game parameters to which all robots must adhere.  TclRobots
      also provides a view on a battle, and a controlling user interface.
      TclRobots requirements: a wish interpreter built from Tcl 7.4 and Tk
      4.0.

      An agent is a process that may migrate through a computer network
      in order to satisfy requests made by clients. Agents are an attractive
      way to describe network-wide computations.
      

      The TACOMA project focuses on operating system support for agents and
      how agents can be used to solve problems traditionally addressed by
      operating systems. We have implemented a series of prototype systems
      to support agents.
      

      TACOMA Version 1.2 is based on UNIX and TCP. The system supports
      agents written in C, Tcl/Tk, Perl, Python, and Scheme (Elk). It is
      implemented in C. This TACOMA version has been in public domain since
      April 1996.
      

      We are currently focusing on heterogeneity, fault-tolerance, security
      and management issues. Also, several TACOMA applications are under
      construction. We implemented StormCast 4.0, a wide-area network
      weather monitoring system accessible over the internet, using TACOMA
      and Java. We are now in the process of evaluating this application,
      and plan to build a new StormCast version to be completed by June
      1997.

        ECoLisp (Embeddable Common Lisp) is an implementation of
        Common Lisp designed for being embeddable into C based
        applications. ECL uses standard C calling conventions for Lisp
        compiled functions, which allows C programs to easily call
        Lisp functions and viceversa. No foreign function interface is
        required: data can be exchanged between C and Lisp with no
        need for conversion. ECL is based on a Common Runtime Support
        (CRS) which provides basic facilities for memory managment,
        dynamic loading and dumping of binary images, support for
        multiple threads of execution. The CRS is built into a library
        that can be linked with the code of the application. ECL is
        modular: main modules are the program development tools (top
        level, debugger, trace, stepper), the compiler, and CLOS. A
        native implementation of CLOS is available in ECL: one can
        configure ECL with or without CLOS. A runtime version of ECL
        can be built with just the modules which are required by the
        application. The ECL compiler compiles from Lisp to C, and
        then invokes the GCC compiler to produce binaries.

      GNU Common Lisp (GCL) has a compiler and interpreter for Common
      Lisp.  It used to be known as Kyoto Common Lisp.  It is very portable
      and extremely efficient on a wide class of applications.  It compares
      favorably in performance with commercial Lisps on several large
      theorem-prover and symbolic algebra systems. It supports the CLtL1
      specification but is moving towards the proposed ANSI definition.  GCL
      compiles to C and then uses the native optimizing C compilers (e.g.,
      GCC).  A function with a fixed number of args and one value turns into
      a C function of the same number of args, returning one value, so GCL
      is maximally efficient on such calls.  It has a conservative garbage
      collector which allows great freedom for the C compiler to put Lisp
      values in arbitrary registers.
      

      It has a source level Lisp debugger for interpreted code, with display
      of source code in an Emacs window.  Its profiling tools (based on the
      C profiling tools) count function calls and the time spent in each
      function.

        binaries (like gcc does from a C source). The obtained executable is
        then stand-alone. The size of this executable can be quite small since
        GNU Prolog can avoid to link the code of most unused built-in
        predicates. The performances of GNU Prolog are very encouraging
        (comparable to commercial systems). 

        Beside the native-code compilation, GNU Prolog offers a classical
        interactive interpreter (top-level) with a debugger.

        The Prolog part conforms to the ISO standard for Prolog with many
        extensions very useful in practice (global variables, OS interface,
        sockets,...). 

        GNU Prolog also includes an efficient constraint solver over Finite
        Domains (FD). This opens contraint logic pogramming to the user
        combining the power of constraint programming to the declarativity of
        logic programming.

      Mercury is a new, purely declarative logic programming language.
      Like Prolog and other existing logic programming languages, it is a
      very high-level language that allows programmers to concentrate on the
      problem rather than the low-level details such as memory management.
      Unlike Prolog, which is oriented towards exploratory programming,
      Mercury is designed for the construction of large, reliable, efficient
      software systems by teams of programmers. As a consequence,
      programming in Mercury has a different flavor than programming in
      Prolog.

    The Mozart system provides state-of-the-art support in two areas: open
    distributed computing and constraint-based inference. Mozart implements
    Oz, a concurrent object-oriented language with dataflow synchronization.
    Oz combines concurrent and distributed programming with logical
    constraint-based inference, making it a unique choice for developing
    multi-agent systems. Mozart is an ideal platform for both general-purpose
    distributed applications as well as for hard problems requiring
    sophisticated optimization and inferencing abilities. We have developed
    applications in scheduling and time-tabling, in placement and
    configuration, in natural language and knowledge representation,
    multi-agent systems and sophisticated collaborative tools.

      Kali Scheme is a distributed implementation of Scheme that
      permits efficient transmission of higher-order objects such as
      closures and continuations. The integration of distributed
      communication facilities within a higher-order programming
      language engenders a number of new abstractions and paradigms
      for distributed computing. Among these are user-specified
      load-balancing and migration policies for threads,
      incrementally-linked distributed computations, agents, and
      parameterized client-server applications. Kali Scheme supports
      concurrency and communication using first-class procedures and
      continuations. It integrates procedures and continuations into a
      message-based distributed framework that allows any Scheme
      object (including code vectors) to be sent and received in a
      message.

      RScheme is an object-oriented, extended version of the Scheme
      dialect of Lisp. RScheme is freely redistributable, and offers
      reasonable performance despite being extraordinarily portable.
      RScheme can be compiled to C, and the C can then compiled with a
      normal C compiler to generate machine code. By default, however,
      RScheme compiles to bytecodes which are interpreted by a
      (runtime) virtual machine. This ensures that compilation is fast
      and keeps code size down. In general, we recommend using the
      (default) bytecode code generation system, and only compiling
      your time-critical code to machine code. This allows a nice
      adjustment of space/time tradeoffs.  (see web site for details)

      Scheme 48 is a Scheme implementation based on a virtual machine
      architecture. Scheme 48 is designed to be straightforward, flexible,
      reliable, and fast. It should be easily portable to 32-bit
      byte-addressed machines that have POSIX and ANSI C support.  In
      addition to the usual Scheme built-in procedures and a development
      environment, library software includes support for hygienic macros (as
      described in the Revised&circ;4 Scheme report), multitasking, records,
      exception handling, hash tables, arrays, weak pointers, and FORMAT.
      Scheme 48 implements and exploits an experimental module system
      loosely derived from Standard ML and Scheme Xerox.  The development
      environment supports interactive changes to modules and interfaces.

      Shift is a programming language for describing dynamic
      networks of hybrid automata.  Such systems consist of
      components which can be created, interconnected and destroyed
      as the system evolves. Components exhibit hybrid behavior,
      consisting of continuous-time phases separated by
      discrete-event transitions. Components may evolve
      independently, or they may interact through their inputs,
      outputs and exported events. The interaction network itself
      may evolve.

            YAP is a high-performance Prolog compiler developed at  
            LIACC/Universidade do Porto. Its Prolog engine is based in the WAM
            (Warren Abstract Machine), with several optimizations for better
            performance. YAP follows the Edinburgh tradition, and is largely
            compatible with DEC-10 Prolog, Quintus Prolog, and especially 
            with C-Prolog. Work on the more recent version of YAP strives at
            several goals:
        
            <itemize>
                <item>Portability: The whole system is now written in C. YAP
                    compiles in popular 32 bit machines, such as Suns and 
                    Linux PCs, and in a 64 bit machines, the Alphas running
                    OSF Unix and Linux. 
                <item>Performance: We have optimised the emulator to obtain
                    performance comparable to or better than well-known Prolog
                    systems. In fact, the current version of YAP performs 
                    better than the original one, written in assembly language.
                <item>Robustness: We have tested the system with a large array 
                    of Prolog applications.
                <item>Extensibility: YAP was designed internally from the
                    beginning to encapsulate manipulation of terms. These
                    principles were used, for example, to implement a simple
                    and powerful C-interface. The new version of YAP extends
                    these principles to accomodate extensions to the 
                    unification algorithm, that we believe will be useful to
                    implement extensions such as constraint programming.
                <item>Completeness: YAP has for a long time provided most
                    builtins expected from a Edinburgh Prolog implementation.
                    These include I/O functionality, data-base operations, 
                    and modules. Work on YAP aims now at being compatible with
                    the Prolog standard. 
                <item>Openess: We would like to make new development of YAP
                    open to the user community. 
                <item>Research: YAP has been a vehicle for research within and
                    outside our group. Currently research is going on on 
                    parallelisation and tabulation, and we have started work
                    to support constraint handling.
