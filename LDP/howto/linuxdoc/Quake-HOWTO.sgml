<sect> Introduction

<sect1> Preamble <p>

Linux Quake sits at the crossroads of two computing revolutions - GNU/Linux,
the popular free operating system, and GLQuake, the first "first person
shooter" to use the 3D graphics library OpenGL.  Quake has a loyal community
still making games almost ten years  after it's release by ID Software, and
thanks to John Carmack releasing the software under the GPL, people are able to
enjoy it on non-proprietary platforms.
<newline> <newline>
Does all this mean our game is important ?  No...  It's just fun ;)

<sect1> About <p>

This document is not an exhaustive how-to about setting up any one Quake
program, but a modern guide to GLQuake, a collection of the most useful tips,
and a pointer to the best resources still available on the web.
It concentrates on the many engine rewrites and incredible add-ons which make
Quake the phenomena it is.

<sect> General Info

<sect1> Getting Started <p>

Installing Quake requires a few basic steps.

<descrip>

<tag/Get the Game Data Files/

Getting the game data files is normally done by installing the game using
Microsoft Windows, or an emulator such as Wine or Dosbox, and then
copying the <bf>id1</bf> directory of the installed game to your Linux Quake
directory (making sure all files are in <ref id="lowercase_" name="lowercase">).

Alternatively, if you have the DOS Quake CD, you can use the
<url url="http://freshmeat.net/projects/lhaforunix/" name="lha utility">
to extract the data files.  For early CDs, you must first
<code>    cat /mnt/cdrom/quake101.1 /mnt/cdrom/quake101.2 > resource.1</code>
Once you have the resource.1 file, then type
<code>
    cd /usr/local/games/quake
    lha e {some directory}/resource.1
</code>

Later versions of the game, including WinQuake, come with the data files in an
uncompressed form and the <bf>id1</bf> directory can be directly copied from
the CD.  


<tag/Install a Quake Executable/

The program you execute to run Quake is known as the
<ref id="engine_" name="game engine">. There are several to choose from, but
the simplest choice is either Jörgen's <ref id="glquake_" name="GLQuake">, or
the author's <url url="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/uhexen2/tyr-glquake?download" name="patched TyrQuake">.
After downloading or compiling a game engine, place
this binary in your Quake directory alongside the <bf>id1</bf> directory.

<tag/Summary/

Finally, you should have a directory structure similar to this, with all files
being in <ref id="lowercase_" name="lowercase">:

<verb>
/usr/local/games/quake +- glquake.glx
                       |
                       +- id1 -+- config.cfg
                               |
                               +- game.dat
                               |
                               +- pak0.pak
                               |
                               +- pak1.pak
</verb>
Now, from an xterm window, type (for example)
<code>    ./glquake.glx -fullscreen -width 800 -height 600</code>
to start the game.


<tag/Help/

This sounds simple, but if you are new to Linux and you are not familiar
with the command line, try one of these links for more information:

<item> <url url="http://www.happypenguin.org" name="The Linux Game Tome">

</itemize>

</descrip>

<sect1> Command Line Options <p>

Command Line Options are extra parameters that are typed on the Linux command
line following the program's name.  Quake has a large number of them, some of
which vary from engine to engine.  The most useful/common ones are:

<descrip>
	<tag/-window/Run the game in windowed mode
	<tag/-fullscreen/Run the game in fullscreen mode
	<tag/-game NAME/Load the mod NAME.
	<tag/-mem N/Reserve N megabytes of memory for the internal heap.  This 
	generally defaults to 8 or 16 meg, but must be increased when playing
	larger mods.
	<tag/-width WIDTH/window/fullscreen width
	<tag/-height HEIGHT/window/fullscreen height
	<tag/-sndspeed MHz/Set sound sampling rate (eg. 44100, 22100, 11025)
	<tag/-sndbits N/Set sound bits to N = 8 or 16
	<tag/-nosound/Disable sound. Necessary when sound is
	absent/unconfigured to stop the game from crashing.
	<tag/-nomtex/Disable GL multitextures.
	<tag/-listen N/Allow a maximum of N players/bots to join multiplayer games.
	<tag/-cddev DEVICE/Use DEVICE for playing the cd music
	<tag/-nocdaudio/Disable cd audio
</descrip>
	
You can also append Quake commands to the Linux command line by prefixing
them with a plus sign. For example, to automatically start a new game
at hard skill, use
<code>    glquake.glx +skill 2 +map e1m1</code>

<sect1> Game Console Commands <p>

<em>For more info see <url url="http://www.planetquake.com/console/commands/quake.html"></em>

The console is an in-game command line at which you can issue commands,
change variables and cheat. It is toggled by pressing the tilde "&tilde;" key when
in a game. The main commands include -

<descrip>

<tag/god/Invulnerability
<tag/noclip/Walk through walls
<tag/notarget/Enemies won't attack player
<tag/timedemo DEMO/Play DEMO (eg. "demo1") at top speed and show frame rate
<tag/impulse N/Issue "impulse N" 

These are in-game commands which can be given special uses. The most 
common cheat is <bf>impulse  9</bf> which gives all weapons.
<tag/bind key "COMMAND"/Bind a key to perform a command
<tag/map MAP/Load MAP
<tag/changelevel MAP/Load MAP without resetting player settings
<tag/quit/Exit to system
<tag/skill	VALUE/value = 0 (easy) - 3 (impossible)

Degree of difficulty. Level must be restarted to take effect
<tag/r_wateralpha	VALUE/value = 0.0 - 1.0

Opacity of water 
<tag/_snd_mixahead 	VALUE/value = 0.1 - 1.0

Raising this value is a good way to speed up the game at the expense of
some sound lag. I use 0.3
<tag/r_shadows	FLAG/flag = 0 | 1

Display model shadows
<tag/vid_wait	FLAG/flag = 0 | 1

Sync video output with screen refresh
<tag/chase_active	FLAG/flag = 0 | 1

Show player from third person perspective

<sect> Game Engines <label id="engine_"> <p>

<sect1> GLQuake <label id="glquake_"> <p>

The first place for Linux noobs to go is Jörgen's no frills site. It is a basic
version of OpenGL Quake for Linux, with some relevant documentation.  Fairly
pain free by Linux standards, it looks and works great, and supports most
Quake mods.

<url url="http://mfcn.ilo.de/glxquake">

<label id="darkplaces_">

<sect1> Darkplaces <p>

Darkplaces is an amazing Quake engine with a great range of visual
enhancements and options for colour, effects and sound. It uses the same Doom3
lighting features as Tenebrae and thus requires a more powerful computer than
GLQuake and QuakeForge.

It also supports many otherwise incompatible mods including <ref id="nehahra_"
name="Nehahra"> and <ref id="nexuiz_" name="Nexuiz">, and has improved support
for the official mission packs.

Havoc's <url url="http://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/files/"
name="file archive"> can be a little confusing.  The large "gameengine2005"
tarballs include precompiled binaries and the game's source code in a second
tarball. To compile your own program uncompress the second tarball
, type <bf>make</bf> to see a list of possible targets (programs), and select
one. For example - to build the OpenGL engine with ALSA sound type <bf>make
cl-release</bf>, or to build with OSS sound, <bf>make cl-release
DP_SOUND_API=OSS</bf>.

Much thanks to Lord Havoc for this great project.

<url url="http://www.icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces">

<label id="qudos_">

<sect1> QuDos Quake Ports <p>

"Here you'll find QuDos' `linuxified` src+bin tarballs for popular quake ports,
including that of bjp for Nehahra."

This is great news for gamers. For the first time these engines - including
DemonQuake, JoeQuake, NehQuake, Qrack and Tremor - have been ported to Linux.
<url url="http://qudos.quakedev.com/linux/quake1/NehQuake-bjp-bin-src.linux.tar.bz2"
name="NehQuake"> runs <ref id="nehahra_" name="Nehahra"> much faster than
Darkplaces, and <url url="http://qudos.quakedev.com/linux/quake1/JoeQuake-v0.15b1146-bin-src.linux.tar.bz2" name="JoeQuake"> has impressive eye candy.

The tarballs include source code, binaries and in most cases the data
files necessary for the engine.  To install these data files, find the simply
named folders (such as "joequake" or "qrack") inside the tarballs and move them
to your quake directory. If they are not present you will have to download them
from the game's homepage.

For some of the engines, an additional sound library (which is included)
has to be installed. To do this:
<code>
    su
    cd /usr/lib
    mv {some directory}/libfmod-3.74.1.so .
    ln -s libfmod-3.74.1.so libfmod.so
    ldconfig
</code>
or visit the <url url="http://www.fmod.org" name="FMOD homepage"> and install the
libraries manually.


<url url="http://qudos.quakedev.com/linux/quake1">

<label id="quakeforge_">

<sect1> QuakeForge <p>

QF is the most comprehensive Linux Quake project. It has a visually enhanced engine,
numerous single player and <ref id="quakeworld_" name="QuakeWorld"> clients and
Quake C tools. Amongst it's features are:
an overhauled menuing sytem, a new "heads up display", and in-game help.

Possibly because of it's size, QuakeForge hasn't been updated in a year and a
half and was never quite finished. Notably - documentation is missing,
installing only a single player client without everything else has issues, and
it may no longer build on FreeBSD.

Kudos to the QuakeForge team for a huge project which has provided much inspiration
for other open source games.

<url url="http://www.quakeforge.net">
<newline>
<url url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/quake/"> 

<label id="tyrquake_">

<sect1> TyrQuake <p>

Is a fairly complete project including Quake and Quakeworld 
clients and <url url="http://disenchant.net/utils.html" name="other tools">
 including the popular TyrLite. Tyrann's focus is on a fully featured
but miminalist engine for Windows and Linux. 

To compile TyrQuake-0.47, first edit the makefile and select a few options.
(The single player client is "NQ").  Nvidia users may have to apply <url
url="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/uhexen2/tyrquake-0.47-nvidia.patch?download"
name="this patch"> to fix a few bugs. Versions after 0.47 should build
without this.

A patched TyrQuake single player binary is available
<url url="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/uhexen2/tyr-glquake?download" name="here">.


<url url="http://disenchant.net/engine.html">

<sect1> Software Quake <p>

<em>For a more in-depth treatment of Software Quake, see the  <ref id="old_" name="previous version"> of this how-to</em>.

The <url url="http://www.quakeforge.net/files/q1source.zip" name="original
WinQuake source"> also came with two pixelated versions of the game:

<itemize>
<item> X Quake (quake.x11)
<item> Svga Quake (squake)
</itemize>
		
but compiling them is no longer straight forward. It involves copying
<bf>Makefile.linux</bf> to <bf>Makefile</bf>, editing this file to remove the extra
targets , replacing <bf>/usr/X11/lib</bf> with <bf>/usr/X11R6/lib</bf> and typing
<bf>make build_release</bf>.

There are easier options though. <ref id="tyrquake_" name="TyrQuake">
and <ref id="quakeforge_" name="QuakeForge"> have software clients, and there is
also an old <url url="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/quake/" name="SDL Quake">
written by SDL's author, Sam Lantinga, which should work on all modern platforms.

<sect1> Other <p>

<label id="nprquake_">

<sect2> NPRQuake <p>

Another Quake engine which has been ported to Linux but afaik hasn't been
touched in a few years is <url url="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/graphics/Gallery/NPRQuake/" name="NPRQuake">.
Notably, it has the ability to load different renderers on the fly (!) which
is pretty cool. The <url url="http://www.geocities.com/coolguywithgun" name="linux port"> includes support for the cartoon renderer
<url url="http://www.cs.unc.edu/%7Eadyilie/comp238/Final/Final.htm" name="ainpr">,
and works really well for me.

The <url url="http://www.tempestgames.com/ryan/" name="SDL version">
has rewritten mouse and video code and may work on otherwise troublesome
systems. But the sound APIs have not been ported to SDL, so it
is not a truly portable engine.

<sect2> Tenebrae <p>

A Quake engine using advanced lighting techniques similar
to those in Doom III. Requires a very fast computer to run and may not be compatible with all hardware.

<url url="http://tenebrae.sourceforge.net/">

<sect2> Twilight Project <p>

The <url url="http://icculus.org/twilight" name="Twilight Project">
"is a set of rather minimalist NQ and QW engines that focus on insane rendering
speed, it is however a bit unstable at the moment."

<sect> Mods

<sect1> Mods <p>

There are hundreds of user created levels - known variously as "mods", "total
conversions" or simply "maps", all over the internet. When it comes to
finding them though, many URLs are no longer valid, and it is easier to just
google for a file name (perhaps adding "quake" as an extra search term) than
to try and find the project's homepage - which is probably just dust in the
ether now.

To run new maps, place the bsp file into the "quake/id1/maps"
subdirectory, and start Quake with the <bf>+map MAPNAME</bf> option.

Installing mods is simply a matter of creating a subdirectory DIR and
extracting the contents of the mod zipfile/tarball into this directory.
It is then loaded by using the <bf>-game DIR</bf> command line option and,
sometimes, <bf>+map MAPNAME</bf> where MAPNAME is the mod's start map. 

For both maps and mods, all files should be in <ref id="lowercase_" name="lowercase"> format.


QuakeTerminus has a good 
<url url="http://www.quaketerminus.com/addon.htm" name="list"> of mods,
and
Tenfour numerous <url url="http://tenfourmaps.telefragged.com/php/revidx.php?gameid=q1&amp;sortby=date&amp;reversesort=1&amp;page=1" name="map reviews">.

A few of the author's favourites are:

<tag/The Hunted Chronicles/
Another game requiring the Darkplaces engine, the Hunted Chronicles is a 
zombie shooter/survival mod in two parts. The second uses fog
and lighting effects to spooky effect, and could almost be mistaken for a
Half-Life mod.
<url url="http://www.ru1337.com/" name="Link">

<tag/Neil Manke's mods/
Neil wrote the definitive Half-Life mod "They Hunger".
The quality and fun is in these maps too -

little dated now, and the numerous spells can be overwhelming -
<url url="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=bmfull.zip" name="bmfull.zip">

<tag/Operation: Urth Majik/
Oum is one of the few Quake 1 mods with a sci-fi feel. It's a well made five

<tag/Fantasy Quake/
FQ is a traditional medieval themed conversion. The game has some
beautiful levels, but also plenty of raw edges - it was never quite finished...
Not all the player classes work perfectly, use the "g" key twice

<sect1> Commercial Mods <p>

<descrip>

<tag/Mission Pack 1/
Scourge of Armagon by Ritual Entertainment (formerly known as Hipnotic Interactive).

<tag/Mission Pack 2/
Dissolution of Eternity by Rogue Entertainment.
<newline><newline>
- Both official mission packs are generally acknowledged as better than the original game.

<tag/Malice/
Very original Quake total conversion, with the greatest
(make believe) machine gun I've ever unleashed.  Worth paying for.

<tag/Abyss of Pandemonium/
Commercial mod now freely available:
<url url="http://www.planetquake.com/impel" name="Link">

<tag/Ravages of Apocalypse/
Xmen mod! Great models. Shame about the game-play.  ...When good mods turn bad.
<newline>
This mod has now been released free of charge, and can be found
<url url="http://www.zerogravity.com.au/xmen/" name="here">.

<tag/Shrak/
One of the first commercial mods. It has well modelled and totally
new monsters, but the game-play doesn't cut it anymore.

</descrip>

<sect1> Mapping tools <p>

Another first for Quake was the implementation of it's own game language -
Quake C.  This enables mods to work seamlessly on any operating system.
It is possible to install many of the editors which are used to make Quake
maps, but creating full scale mods is real voodoo and beyond my knowledge.

<bf>GtkRadiant</bf>
is the only currently maintained world editor I know of.
<url url="http://www.qeradiant.com/" name="Link">

The <bf>Quake Army Knife</bf> (QuArK) is a multi-purpose Quake editing tool which..

<sect1> Digital Paint 2 <p>

Paintball comes to Linux !

Digital Paint 2 is an "original" multiplayer game based on the

<sect1> Sound Problems <p>

<em>For more information about Linux sound see the <ref id="sound_" name="drivers"> section.
</em>

An error such as: "<bf>/dev/dsp: Device or resource busy</bf>" indicates some program is
already using your sound card, and you will have to halt this program to get
Quake sound effects.

<itemize>

<item> From the Linux command line, type <bf>killall artsd</bf>
or <bf>killall esd</bf> to terminate either of these popular sound daemons.

<newline> <newline>

<item> Alternatively, to run Quake through the KDE sound daemon, type
<bf>artsdsp glquake.glx ...</bf>

</itemize>

"Quake engine games exit, and I see an error about <bf>mmap</bf>!"

<itemize>

<item> The <url url="http://www.icculus.org/lgfaq" name="Linux Gamers FAQ">
recommends "Your sound card/driver doesn't support this needed feature.
However, if you use KDE/arts you may be able to bypass this with the -m switch
to the artsdsp wrapper".
<newline><newline>
Make sure the <bf>artsd</bf> program is running 
by typing <bf>ps -A | grep artsd</bf> and checking that this command returns
at least one non-empty line. Then type <bf>artsdsp -m glquake.glx</bf>.

<newline><newline>

<item> Try alternative sound drivers as outlined in the
<ref id="sound_" name="Sound Drivers"> section.

</itemize>

Sound stutters or is not very good.

<itemize>

<item> Try using the <bf>-sndspeed</bf> or <bf>-sndbits</bf> option(s), or
swapping sound drivers.

</itemize>

<sect1> Other Issues <p>

<descrip>

<tag/Game is too dark/If changing the brightness setting in the options menu
doesn't work, you can use the <bf>xgamma</bf> program to brighten the whole display.

<itemize>

<item> Type <bf>xgamma -gamma VALUE</bf> before running the game, where VALUE is a number larger than 1.
<newline>When you've finished, use <bf>xgamma -gamma 1</bf> to restore the brightness.
</itemize>
<newline>
This tip will not work with poorly supported hardware. For Voodoo 1/2 users, visit

<tag/Mouse look/"This game won't let me look around properly. %$!$@"

<itemize>

<item> Bring down the game console with the "&tilde;" key and enter <bf>+mlook</bf>.

</itemize>

<tag/Mouse doesn't work properly/ Try the following -

<itemize>

<item> Start the game in fullscreen mode by using the <bf>-fullscreen</bf> option.

<newline><newline>

<item> From the game console, type <bf>_windowed_mouse 1</bf>

<newline><newline>

<item> If you're using fluxbox, try another window manager.  Fluxbox has issues
with some games in fullscreen mode.

<newline><newline>

<item> If still without success, try the
<ref id="nprquake_" name="NPRQuake"> or <ref id="darkplaces_" name="Darkplaces">
SDL clients.
Typing <bf>export SDL_VIDEO_X11_DGAMOUSE=0</bf> before starting
the game will disable hardware dga mouse.

<newline><newline>

</itemize>

<tag/Game saves fail &sol; Options not remembered/If you are running Quake
as a normal user and experiencing these problems it's probably due to 
having insufficient privileges to write to the game directories. Solutions
include:

<itemize>

<item> Run the game as super user: Type <bf>su</bf> and enter root's
password before typing <bf>glquake.glx ...</bf> to start the game.

<newline><newline>

<item> Change the game file permissions. Unix operating systems have
strong security preventing unauthorised or accidental file changes.
The simplest way to overcome this in a single user environment is to become
super user and change ownership of the quake directory with (as root):
<bf>chown -R USERNAME /usr/local/games/quake</bf>. However it is
recommended users read the <bf>chmod</bf> and <bf>chown</bf> man
and info pages to better understand Unix file permissions.

<newline><newline>

<item> In full multi-user environments it is recommended using the
<ref id="darkplaces_" name="Darkplaces"> or 
<ref id="quakeforge_" name="QuakeForge"> game engines, which do not suffer file
permission problems.

</itemize>

Quake uses a confusing method of saving and restoring game options, 
especially when playing add-ons, and game options sometimes have to be
reinitialised even though file permissions are not an issue.
In such cases, the author can offer no simple advice %-/.

<tag/Crazy polygons/
Some mission-packs/mods for Quake can cause existing player/monster models to
be drawn with lines all over the place. To fix this, delete the directory
"quake/id1/glquake".  When you next run the game, it will remake this directory
and everything should be fine.

<tag/Lines on screen/
A common problem with 3dfx cards is a shower of flickering lines on the screen.
		
<itemize>

<item> From the game console, type <bf>gl_ztrick 0</bf>.

</itemize>

<tag/Other graphical anomalies/

Some Quake engines use an OpenGL speed-up known as multitexturing.
This normally works fine, but if you are experiencing glitches
you can disable this feature with the <bf>-nomtex</bf> option.

Older video cards may occasionally draw models in all white.
See the PlanetQuake <url url="http://www.planetquake.com/console/commands/quake.html" 
name="command list"> for in-game GL variables to fine tune performance.

</descrip>

<sect1> Video Drivers <p>

Setting up hardware GL acceleration under Linux used to be a big deal, but
modern distros should now handle this automatically. Of course there are
exceptions...

Nvidia's drivers for all of their modern video cards are not open source.
Because of this many distributions do not include them. If your Nvidia card is
running slowly this is probably the cause, and  you should visit <url
url="http://www.nvidia.com"> to download the Linux installer. In the author's
experience these drivers are great, but not all versions work 100% with all
cards. If you have a misbehaving Nvidia video card, try a different driver.

While new versions of XFree and Xorg have great support for Voodoo 3, 4 and 5,
early 3dfx hardware such as Voodoo1, Voodoo2 and Rush are no longer hardware
accelerated. To get OpenGL working for these cards, you'll need to download,
install and/or compile the software libraries called Glide and Mesa.
<url url="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=28982&amp;group_id=124987" name="Here">
is a detailed README on old 3dfx cards.

<sect1> Sound Drivers <label id="sound_"> <p>

There are two major Linux sound systems -
Open Sound System and ALSA.  If you are experiencing sound problems and
the trouble-shooting section hasn't helped, you
may consider changing the sound driver. This can be hard work, and is only
for experienced users.

To ascertain which driver you are currently using,
type <bf>lsmod</bf> to list currently loaded kernel modules. The ALSA sound
modules have verbose names starting with "snd_", while the OSS modules have
more terse names. For example, the ALSA Sound Blaster Live module is
"snd_emu10k1", while the OSS module is "emu10k1". Since Linux kernel 2.6, ALSA
has been the standard sound system, while 2.4 and earlier were more likely to
come with OSS sound.

Information about ALSA can be found at the
<url url="http://www.alsa-project.org" name="Alsa Homepage">
and Linux Journal's
<url url="http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/8234/print" name="Guide to ALSA">.

For those already with ALSA wishing to try the OSS modules, a 
<url url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO/" name="kernel recompile">
is probably necessary.

<label id="hexenII_">

<sect1> Hexen II <p>
			  
Hexen II is a colourful adaption of the Quake engine, and in terms of
source code and theme is much closer than Quake II to the original
game. Unfortunately, <url url="http://ravensoft.com" name="Raven Software">
released the game with many rough edges... So beautiful, yet so cruel.

<url url="http://uhexen2.sourceforge.net" name="Hammer of Thyrion">
 is the main Linux Hexen II port , and has had much work
done towards squishing bugs and enhancing the OpenGL graphics.
While it is not as widely distributed as Quake, the HoT demo includes some
of the game's best levels and is available from the Sourceforge <url
url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/uhexen2" name="project page">.

<sect1> Quake II <label id="quakeII_"> <p>

Quake II is the sci-fi themed sequel to Quake.

Early Linux releases weren't very solid, especially the mouse handling.
Current releases should work fine - the latest from QuakeForge is available

<sect1> Quake III Arena <p>

The third Quake installment was a landmark multiplayer game, with some of the
most beautiful and well balanced fragging ever. It was one of the first games
to receive a full Linux commercial release.

Recently <url url="http://www.idsoftware.com" name="ID Software">
released the source code, and you'll find an
<url url="http://www.icculus.org/quake3/" name="Open Source Quake III"> project
at Icculus.org.

Most mods should work. The Linux Gamers FAQ reports:
<verb>
    Yes, ... modifications work in Linux as long as they are compiled to the
    Quake III ... VM bytecode as advised by id software.  ...  modifications
    compiled to Windows library files will not work.</verb>

The retail add-on Quake III Team Arena is supported and, despite never
getting rave reviews, is a great game.

	<item> Because of the way the original game renders the sky, any map with
	numerous outdoor enemies suffers a big performance hit.

	<item> Rocket-jumping is the technique of using a rocket or grenade
	explosion to jump further than normal. For a demonstration see the
	Scourge done Slick speed run.

<newline><newline>

	<item> John Carmack -
	<newline>
	"At this time (march '97), the only standard opengl hardware that can play
	glquake reasonably is an intergraph realizm, which is a VERY expensive card"

<newline><newline>

	<item> From the original Quake How-To -
	<newline>
	"Hardware-accelerated OpenGL Quake is Quake the way God intended it to
	be. There is no substitute, and once you've experienced it there's no
	going back."

<newline><newline>

	<item> Moby Games 
	<newline> (by  Pathogen) <newline> 
	..... Quake was the first FPS to introduce realistic lighting and
	shadows.  Of course, this came at a price. Quake has taken a lot of
	flak because it's all dull brown and grey. This was necessary because
	it was the only way to get the lighting to work properly. Since each
	surface needs a wide variety of reserved colors for displaying
	darkened/brightened portions of the surface, the game was limited to
	just a few colors and all their respective shades.
	<newline> (by Ashley Pomeroy) <newline>
	Almost incidentally, Quake introduced the now-standard concept of a FPS
	"console", and popularised "mouselook" as *the* absolute standard
	control interface.  Although the specifications required a Pentium,
	Quake ran acceptably well on a 486 DX4/100

<newline><newline>

	<item> Popular games derived from the Quake engine include -
	Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Half-Life, Star Trek Voyager - Elite Force,
	Soldier of Fortune, American McGee's Alice, and - distantly - Doom III.

<sect1> Glossary <p>

<descrip>

<tag/ALSA/ <url url="http://www.alsa-project.org" name="Advanced Linux Sound Architecture">.

<tag/API/Application Program Interface. The computer libraries
which are used when programming, and link the game to the hardware.

<tag/Bot/A computer generated player with artificial intelligence (cough), in
a multiplayer game. Used to play multiplayer when no-one's around or not
connected to a network.

<tag/Client/This word is used in two subtly different ways. In single player,
the Quake game is known as a client, with different clients using their own
graphics libraries (for example, the GL client "quake.glx" or the X11 client
"quake.x11"). The usage is similar in multiplayer games, but also means the
per-user program which connects to a single "server" program which lets all
the players exist in the same world.

<tag/FPS/First Person Shooter. A shooting game viewed from the "first person" perspective.

<tag/Mod/Modification to the original Quake game varying from a complete game
overhaul (total conversion) to simple map/model reworks.  Quake was designed to
allow for ease of platform portability with it's own computer language "Quake
C" giving mappers control over most every aspect of their Quake world.

<tag/Noob/Newbie. Someone new to a computer related topic.

<tag/Patch/A software patch (or diff) is a single file used to alter
a source code tree before compilation. It is often used to fix bugs or
add new features that the original author didn't include.

Usage of the GNU patch utility is of the form <bf>patch [--dry-run] -pNUM
&lt;FILE </bf> where NUM is the number (usually 0 or 1) of directories to
strip from the patch file. This number is not obvious except to unix gurus, but
using the "--dry-run" option will let you test run patch so you can find the
correct NUM. ...Using the wrong number will make patch output all sorts of
cryptic messages which can be terminated with a <bf>control-C</bf> character.

Of course you could always type <bf>man patch</bf> and learn for yourself
how to use this powerful unix command. ;-/

<tag/SDL/<url url="http://www.libsdl.org/" name="Simple DirectMedia Layer">
cross platform graphics API.

<tag/Server/A program central to multiplayer games to which every player connects.

<tag/Tarball/An archive file such as <bf>somefile.tar</bf> created by the
"tar" program.  It is often compressed using the programs
"gzip" or "bzip2", in which case it will normally end in the letters
<bf>.gz</bf> or <bf>.bz2</bf>. The extension <bf>.tar.gz</bf>
is often shortened to just <bf>.tgz</bf>.
