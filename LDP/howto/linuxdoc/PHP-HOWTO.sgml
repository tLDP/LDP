<chapt>Introduction

<sect>Introduction
<p>
PHP stands for 'Hypertext Pre-Processor' and is a server 
side HTML scripting/programming language.
PHP is a tool that lets you create dynamic web pages. PHP-enabled web pages
are treated just like regular HTML pages and you can create and edit them
the same way you normally create regular HTML pages.

PHP was kept the <bf>"top secret and strictly confidential"</bf> 
computer language by many companies in the world, but now had become 
the most well-known and most widely used scripting language for 
web, internet, e-commerce and business-to-business projects. 
Even today many competing companies keep PHP language as a 
highly confidential matter not disclosing to outsiders (competitors).

PHP will storm the entire world and will take the IT industry by surprise!!
The power of PHP is that it is <bf>cross-platform and runs everywhere!!</bf>
It runs on Linux, Windows 95/98/NT, Windows 2000, Solaris, HPUX and all
flavors of unix.  PHP is write once and deploy anywhere and everywhere.
It runs on many web-servers like Apache, Microsoft IIS, etc..

PHP runs 5 to 20 times faster than Java!! It is extremely easy to use 
and you can develop very complex web/e-commerce applications 
very rapidly in a very short period of time.

It has object oriented features and takes the best features from Java,
C++, PERL and "C" languages. PHP language is a <it>marriage</it> of
best features from Java, C++, PERL and C.

PHP is the <bf>real gem</bf> of all the scripting/programming languges 
and will soon become the "MECCA" for programmers world-wide!! 
PHP has a huge user base and a large 
developer base as it runs on both window95/NT and all flavors of unixes.

PHP can be compiled and optimized to make it run even faster by using the
Zend Optimizer. Zend optimizer is integrated with PHP in PHP version 4.0.

You would normally use a combination of 
PHP (70% code) + HTML/DHTML/XML (25% code) + Javascript (5% code client side validations) 
for your e-commerce projects.

<sect1> PHP Installation on Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT/2000<label id = "PHP Installation">
<p>
PHP is <bf>IMMENSELY POPULAR</bf> on Microsoft Windows platform and is <bf>surprisingly 
more popular</bf> than Microsoft's own ASP web scripting language!! 
PHP runs lot faster than ASP on MS Windows and has more features and functionalities
than Microsoft ASP.
PHP is much more robust, reliable and powerful than ASP.
And the user base of PHP is extremely large because PHP runs on MS Windows,
Linux, Mac OS and all unixes.
Greatest advantage of
PHP is that you can develop on MS Windows and deploy on Linux or Unix and vice versa!!

There are more PHP users under MS Windows98/NT/2000 than on any other operating system!!
Because there is so much demand for PHP on MS Windows 98/NT/2000, a ready to 
install executable is made and you simply double-click on the exe file to 
automatically install PHP in just 2 minutes. Download the PHP executable 
install file from

<sect1> SQL server for Microsoft 
<p>
SQL server can be on a seperate box which need not be running MS Windows.
You also need a SQL server for doing web development. I recommend that you
install Redhat Linux on a very old PC like (Pentium or 486 box) and install the
PostgreSQL RPMs on it. You do not need any windows graphics for a database server
and at console mode startup the PostgreSQL server. PostgreSQL is <bf>3 times </bf>
faster than Oracle or MS SQL server. You can also order ready-to-go cheap Linux boxes
from <url url="http://www.egghead.com">, go here and click on Autions and Linux boxes.
You get best deals in live Auctions.

You can also get PostgreSQL for Windows NT/2000 from <url url="http://www.askesis.nl">.

<sect> PHP Tutorial <label id = "PHP Tutorial">
<p>
Visit the following PHP tutorial sites -
<itemize>
<item> PHP Resource index - important PHP site - has 
complete scripts, Functions, classes, documentation, examples and tutorials
<url url="http://php.resourceindex.com">
<item> PHP portal <url url="http://zend.com">

<item> PHP TidBits <url url="http://www.htmlwizard.net/resources/tutorials">
<item> PHP Builder <url url="http://www.phpbuilder.com/getit">
</itemize>

In this tutorial we assume that your server has support for PHP activated
and that all files ending in .php3 are handled by PHP. 

Your first PHP-enabled page:  
Create a file named hello.php3 and in it put the following lines:
<code>
      <html>< head>< title >PHP Test< /title >< /head >
      < body>
      <?php echo "Hello World<P>"; ?>
      < /body>< /html>
</code>

Note that this is not like a CGI script. 
Think of it as a normal HTML file which happens to have a set of
special tags available to you.

If you tried this example and it didn't output anything, chances are that
the server you are on does not have PHP enabled. Ask your administrator to
enable it for you.

The point of the example is to show the special PHP tag format. In this
example we used &lt ?php to indicate the start of a PHP tag. Then we put the
PHP statement and left PHP mode by adding the closing tag, ? &gt . You may jump
in and out of PHP mode in an HTML file like this all you want.

We are going to check what sort of
browser the person viewing the page is using. In order to do that we check
the user agent string that the browser sends as part of its request. This
information is stored in a variable. Variables always start with a
dollar-sign in PHP. The variable we are interested in is $HTTP_USER_AGENT.
To display this variable we can simply do:
<code>
      <?php echo $HTTP_USER_AGENT; ?>
</code>

For the browser that you are using right now to view this page, this
displays:

     Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.01; Windows 98)

There are many other variables that are automatically set by your web
server. You can get a complete list of them by creating a file that looks
like this:
<code>
      <?php phpinfo()?>
</code>

Then load up this file in your browser and you will see a page full of
information about PHP along with a list of all the variables available to
you.

You can put multiple PHP statements inside a PHP tag and create little
blocks of code that do more than just a single echo. 
<code>
      <?php
      if(strstr($HTTP_USER_AGENT,"MSIE")) {
          echo "You are using Internet Explorer<br>";
      }
      ?>
</code>

We can take this a step further and show how you can jump in and out of PHP
mode even in the middle of a PHP block:

<code>
	<?php
	if(strstr($HTTP_USER_AGENT,"MSIE")) 
	{
		?>
		< center>< b>You are using Internet Explorer< /b>< /center>
		<?
	} 
	else 
	{
		?>
		< center>< b>You are not using Internet Explorer< /b>< /center>
		<?
	}
	?>
</code>
Instead of using a PHP echo statement to output something, we jumped out of
PHP mode and just sent straight HTML. The important and powerful point to
note here is that the logical flow of the script remain intact. Only one of
the HTML blocks will end up getting sent to the viewer. Running this script
right now results in:

                       You are using Internet Explorer

Dealing with Forms

One of the most powerful features of PHP is the way it handles HTML forms.
The basic concept that is important to understand is that any form element
in a form will automatically result in a variable with the same name as the
element being created on the target page. This probably sounds confusing, so
here is a simple example. Assume you have a page with a form like this on
it:
<code>
      <form action="action.php3" method="POST">
      Your name: <input type=text name=name>
      You age: <input type=text name=age>
      <input type=submit>
      < /form>
</code>
There is nothing special about this form. It is a straight HTML form with no
special tags of any kind. When the user fills in this form and hits the
submit button, the action.php3 page is called. In this file you would have
something like this:
<code>
      Hi <?php echo $name?>.  You are <?php echo $age?> years old.
</code>
Surprise!! The $name and $age variables are automatically set for you by PHP !!

<sect1>Primer on PHP Sessions<label id = "sessions">
<p>
Before we begin, let's quickly go over the concept of a session and the reason we need it. It's hard (for me) to define what a session is exactly, so let's use an example that should be very familiar to you -- logging in to your computer and using it every day. After you log in, your computer knows who you are. Every action that you perform is done so with your name.

So what's so special about that -- we take it for granted every time we have to login to any system. What's the big deal with doing this on the web? Well, the web (or specifically, the HTTP protocol) is connectionless. That means each request made to a web server is independent of all the other requests. Whereas your computer keeps information about you in memory and knows when you log in and out, a web server doesn't. A web server simply waits for requests and sends responses.

Let's illustrate this a little bit:

<code>
John Doe           __________         Jane Doe 
  1               |          |            2
  3  ------------>|web server|<---------- 4
  5               |__________|            6
</code>

Let's say we only have two people, John Doe and Jane Doe, accessing MyMarket, and their actions are like this:

<enum>
<item> John looks at the product catalog. 
<item> Jane looks at the product catalog. 
<item> John adds an item to his basket. 
<item> Jane adds an item to her basket. 
<item> John goes to the checkout. 
<item> Jane goes to the checkout.
</enum>

Since HTTP is connectionless, each request is completely isolated from the other requests. So how does the server know who's doing what? How does the server know that actions 1, 3, 5 are from John, and actions 2, 4, 6 are from Jane? Well, to make a long story short, the web server doesn't have to know. It can continue on happily responding to requests, session management has to be done with the backend scripting language.

What we need is a way to group together requests by the same person into the same session. This is where PHP4's session management capabilities come in. It can group together requests made from the same source (eg. client's browser) into the same session, we have to provide the smarts to associate users with sessions.

In other words, PHP4's session management can tell us requests 1, 3, and 5 belong to the same session (call it session A). Our application has to know that session A is owned by John Doe.
<!--
	*******************************************

<sect1>Session Management in PHP4<label id = "sessionsmgmt">
<p>
PHP4 adds some session management functions that make our life easier when dealing with sessions. The ones we are interested in are:
<code>
session_start(); 
session_register();
</code>

session_start() is used to start up PHP4's session management capabilities; you need to call it before you use any of the other session functions. session_register() is used to tell PHP which variables to track in the session. A typical call to these functions would look like this:

session_register("SESSION");

This tells PHP to start up the session manager, and tells PHP that the variable called SESSION is a session variable. You can register as many session variables as you like, but I prefer to only register one session variable called SESSION, and anything I need persistent I put into this variable. For example, I like to say:

<code>
session_register("SESSION");
$SESSION["var1"] = 5;
$SESSION["var2"] = 6;
</code>

instead of
<code>
session_register("var1");
session_register("var2");
$var1 = 5;
$var2 = 6;
</code>
because after you register lots of session variables, you tend to forget what 
they were, well, at least I do :).

Anyhow, by now you probably want to see some code in action, so create a script called session_test.php somewhere accessible, and put into it:

<code>
<?
session_start();
session_register("SESSION");

if (! isset($SESSION)) {
	$SESSION["count"] = 0;
	echo "<li>Counter initialized, please reload this page to see it increment";
} else {
	echo "<li>Waking up session $PHPSESSID";
	$SESSION["count"]++;
}
echo "<li>The counter is now $SESSION[count] ";
?>
</code>

Fire that up in your browser, the first time you hit the page, it should say " Counter initialized, please reload this page to see it increment". Each time you reload it, the counter value should increment by one. You will also see the session ID. If it does, then hurray, your PHP4 session manager works :)

So how does this work? Well, when you call session_start(), PHP4 determines a unique session ID for the client. This session ID is an MD5 hash of something (not sure what), and it is stored as a cookie on the client's PC.

Now each time that client makes a request, PHP4 will read this session ID and load up the data for the session. When you call session_register(), you are telling PHP4 which variables you want kept in the session. Each page that loads up, the previous values for the registered variables will be reloaded, and each time the page ends PHP4 will save the values of the registered variables.

By default, PHP keeps track of the sessions in temporary files in the /tmp directory, take a listings and see for yourself:

You will see something like this:

<code>
-rw-------   1 apache   web            10 May  7 15:27 sess_6dd9ea8e61cd49cd3ad6de8c8b8885e8
-rw-------   1 apache   web            10 May  7 19:49 sess_7d7f97afb6759948f554b00272494e52
-rw-------   1 apache   web             6 May  9 01:00 sess_8ab78830e151add9d79b628958ce4eb9
-rw-------   1 apache   web            31 May  9 11:41 sess_a3058a6bb1baf57f565c3844c8810f4b
-rw-------   1 apache   web            30 May  9 11:42 sess_c379faad83ad3dc8ab6d22c14dbab3b4
-rw-------   1 apache   web             6 May  8 01:00 sess_cd68a5054241aff1a8157c289683e869
-rw-------   1 apache   web            34 May  7 15:17 sess_cd97e41912b28c44cc0481b7d978cb61
-rw-------   1 apache   web            42 May  9 11:23 sess_d1285edd0c951c70b1aec17a5f602fc0
-rw-------   1 apache   web            30 May  9 11:42 sess_da93f6e19b6be01257d7a6453766a23d
-rw-------   1 apache   web            42 May  7 21:26 sess_e837123c1af78c538e89b47030fde337
</code>

Each one of those files is a session, let's take a look at one of them (note, you probably have to su to root to peek inside a session file). Tip: don't just cut and paste the following commands, you need to specify the name of a real file:

<code>
# more /tmp/sess_a3058a6bb1baf57f565c3844c8810f4b
</code>

You will see something like this:

<code>
SESSION|a:1:{s:5:"count";i:234;}
</code>

Does that look familiar? It should if you've ever used the serialize() and unserialize() functions in PHP. If not, don't worry about it. Anyhow, I just wanted to illustrate how sessions were stored. You can rewrite the PHP session handlers to store sessions into a database or whatever else, but that's beyond the scope of this tutorial (but it's not hard at all).

<sect1>User Management and Privileges<label id = "usermgt">
<p>
Okay, we've spend enough time on PHP4's session management, all you really need to get out of that was the two functions session_start() and session_register(). Let's get back to the issue of keeping track of users.

PHP can help us keep track of sessions, and group requests from the same session together. Now, we have to do our part and associate user accounts with these sessions. We will use a variable called SESSION["user"] to keep track of user information. When a user logs in, we will put their information into this variable. As long as this variable is defined, we will assume that a user has logged in. When a user logs off, we will clear out this variable.

Specifically, we will keep the following information about the user:

<code>
SESSION["user"]["username"] This is the user's login ID (their nick name if you will), and it is how we tell users apart from each other. 
SESSION["user"]["firstname"] The user's firstname. 
SESSION["user"]["lastname"] The user's lastname. 
SESSION["user"]["email"] The user's email address. 
SESSION["user"]["priv"] The user's privilege level.
</code>

Let's talk a bit about the privilege levels. We are going to have two levels of security: (1) normal customers and (2) administrative users. Normal customers can use the system, browse through the catalog, and do other customer functions. Administrators can do everything a normal user can do, but also has the ability to perform system administrative functions (e.g. everything from part 1 of this guide). In real life, there are probably many more privilege levels that you want defined but we are going to keep things simple here.

This is all fine and dandy, but where do we get this user information from? We need to have a way to store all the users on the system, and the perfect place for that would be in the database. We're going to create a users table to hold all our users.
<!--
	*******************************************
	************ End of Section ***************
	*******************************************

-->
<sect1>Step1: Creating the Users Table<label id = "usertable">
<p>
Start up database server and login to database.
Let's create the user table:

<code>
psql> CREATE TABLE users (
->   username     char(16) not null,
->   password     char(32) not null,
->   priv         char(5) not null,
->   firstname    varchar(64) not null,
->   lastname     varchar(64) not null,
->   email        varchar(128) not null,
->   phone        varchar(32) not null,
->   address      varchar(255) not null,
->   PRIMARY KEY (username),
->   UNIQUE email (email)
-> );
</code>
Notice the constraints we've put on the users table, the username is the primary key (which makes sense, you should be able to identify a user record based on the username). The email address has a unique constraint as well because we don't want duplicate email addresses. 

Now let's add a record to create the root user with the password password:

<code>
psql> INSERT INTO users VALUES (
->    'root',
->    '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99',
->    'admin',
->    'System',
->    'Administrator',
->    'root@mymarket.com',
->    '555-5555',
->    '123 5 Avenue'
-> );
</code>

Notice the password looks a bit wierd, <bf>5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99</bf>. This 
is the MD5 hash of the the word "password", I won't go into details here, but the important thing to note is that it's a one-way algorithm and it always produces a 32 character string.

That's it, we have a users table to track our users, and one administrative account 
so we can try logging in and out of the system using the example tar file 
(download the example tar file from 
<url url="http://www.devshed.com/Server_Side/PHP/Commerce1">
).

<chapt> ctags for PHP !! <label id = "ptags">
-->
<sect> ctags for PHP ! Surprise!!! <label id = "ptags">
<p>
Tags are extremely valuable and are used for navigation of source code inside the 
editors like vi, emacs, CRiSP, NEdit etc... If you had 
programmed a lot in C, C++ or Java you
might have used the <bf>ctags</bf> program to create tags.
To see the online manual page, type 'man ctags' at linux/unix bash prompt.

The <bf>ptags</bf> program for PHP is given below, which you can
use to create the tags for PHP source code. Your <bf>productivity will
improve 3 to 4 times</bf> if you use <bf>ptags</bf>.

<chapt> Debugging PHP <label id = "debugphp">
-->
<sect> Debugging PHP <label id = "debugphp">
<p>
To debug PHP programs create a file "debug2.inc" having the 
following functions :
<code>
<?php

/* define this variable, to prevent double declaration.	*/
if (!defined("_DEBUG2_DEFINED_")) 
{
	define("_DEBUG2_DEFINED_", 1 );
}
else
	return; // if this file is already included then return

# file name : debug2.inc
# Functions for debuging the PHP source code
#*****************************************************************
# Copyright policy is GNU/GPL but additional request is
# that you include author's name and email on all copies
# Author : Al Dev Email: alavoor@yahoo.com
#*****************************************************************

# Usage of this functions -
# In your source code put something like -
# debug2_(__FILE__, __LINE__, "f_somevariable", $f_somevariable);
# And this will generate output in debug.out file.

//function debug2_($fname, $lname, $debug_var, $debug_value=0) {}

// Give read, exec for all on directory /debug2_logs
// chmod a+rwx /debug2_logs
// But here you need to open the file in append mode.
$fp_debug2 = fopen("/debug2_logs/debug.out", "a");
if ($fp_debug2 == false)
{
	print "<b>File open failed - global.var.inc<b>";
	exit;
}

function debug2_($fname, $lname, $debug_var, $debug_value=0)
{
	global $fp_debug2;

	//print "<br> debug_value is : $debug_value <br>";
	if (!$debug_value)
	{
		fwrite($fp_debug2, "\n ". $fname ."  ". $lname .": $debug_var");
	}
	else
	{
		fwrite($fp_debug2, "\n ". $fname . " ". $lname .": $debug_var = $debug_value");
	}
	//print "<br> f_cookie is : $f_cookie <br>";
}

// In your first page, which is generally index.php3 
// truncate the debug2_logs file in beginning of code
function init_debug_file()
{
	global $fp_debug2;

	$fp_debug2 = fopen("/debug2_logs/debug.out", "w");
	if ($fp_debug2 == false)
	{
		print "<b>File open failed - global.var.inc<b>";
		exit;
	}
	system("chmod a+rwx /debug2_logs/debug.out");
}

?>
</code>

In your PHP source code initial page which is generally index.php3, put 
a line like 
<code>
<?php
	include ("debug2.inc");

	init_debug_file();
	// all other commands follows here ...
	// ...........
?>
</code>

To output debug values, in your PHP source code files, put debug2_() calls
as illustrated below:
<code>
<?php
include ("debug2.inc");
debug2_(__FILE__, __LINE__, "f_somevariable", $f_somevariable);

function aa()
{
	$aa = 8;
	debug2_(__FILE__, __LINE__, "aa", $aa);
}
?>
</code>

When you run the PHP program the output will be traced in the file called
debug.out giving the filename, linenumber, variable name and it's value.

Use the debug2_() generously in your code. The usage of debug2_() calls
in your program will <bf>NOT</bf> have any impact on the 
final production code and 
also has no impact on the performance because they will be filtered out
as described below. You can use copy and paste to save time 
of typing debug2() calls
or use the 'yank to buffer' feature of Vi editor and paste.

When you are done development and testing and when you are ready to 
deploy on the production server, filter out the debug2_ calls from
your source code. At unix prompt -
<code>
bash$ mkdir production
bash$ grep -v debug2_  filea.php3 > production/filea.php3
</code>
For a large group of files -
<code>
bash$ mkdir production
bash$ ls *.php3 | while read ans 
do 
	grep -v  debug2_ $ans > production/$ans
done
</code>
And now copy the files from production to the deployment area.

<chapt change> Limitations of PHP
-->
<sect> Limitations of PHP
<p>
Everything has limitations or disadvantages and PHP is no exception.
The following are the limitations of PHP (so be <bf>WARNED !!</bf>)
<enum>
<item> PHP is NOT 100 % pure Object Oriented scripting language.
PHP is good if your PHP code size does not exceed 3,00,000 lines.
Maintainence of PHP code greater than 3,00,000 lines becomes more difficult.
<item> PHP will NOT give the performance of "C" or "C++" language. Because
it is scripting language and is interpreted it will be a bit slower than
the optimized "C++" programs. For top performance, you should use "C++" and 
fast-CGI with database/webserver
connection pooling and use C++ compiler optimizer "-O3" options. 
Zend optimizer in PHP 4 will speed up the performance of PHP to certain extent.
<item> But note a point that PHP was designed for very Rapid Web-Application
Development tool. If it takes about 2 months to code a web application in C++,
then using PHP you can develop the same web application in about 4 days!!
And with zend optimizer, the speed of execution of PHP will be very 
close to that of equivalent C++ program!!
</enum>

On the other hand, PHP has lot of advantages and it's advantages outweigh it's
limitations -
<enum>
<item> You can very rapidly develop web applications in PHP as compile and link
is eliminated in PHP scripting language.
<item> PHP applications are very stable and do not depend on the browser
technologies unlike Javascript applications which depend on browsers.
PHP will give you the freedom to select any server platform and browser does
not know that the HTML page is generated by PHP!!
<item> PHP has excellent database conectivity to all SQL database servers.
<item> PHP has partial support for Object oriented features
<item> PHP has C++, Perl, Javascript like syntax features and has programs like
'ptags/ctags' to navigate the source code
<item> PHP has Zend optimizer which speeds up the performance
<item> PHP runs on all unixes, linux, Windows 95/NT/2000 and is more 
powerful than ASP, JSP and others.
<item> PHP has a very large user base and developer base.
</enum>

<bf>WARNING: </bf> If you want 100% pure Object Oriented scripting language
than you MUST consider <bf>Python</bf>. The 'Python' is a object 
oriented scripting
language from ground up. You would be using the Python Web Application server 
called 'Zope' which is available at -
<url url="http://www.zope.org"> 
and python is at
<url url="http://www.python.org">

<sect> Other Formats of this Document
<p>
This document is published in 12 different formats namely - DVI, Postscript, 
Latex, Adobe Acrobat PDF,
LyX, GNU-info, HTML, RTF(Rich Text Format), Plain-text, Unix man pages, 
single HTML file and SGML.
<itemize>
<item>
You can get this HOWTO document as a single file tar ball in HTML, DVI, 
Postscript or SGML formats from -
<url url="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/">

<item>Plain text format is in: <url url="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO">

<item>Translations to other languages like French, German, Spanish, 
Chinese, Japanese are in
<url url="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO">
Any help from you to translate to other languages is welcome.
</itemize>
The document is written using a tool called "SGML-Tools" which can be got from - 
<url url="http://www.sgmltools.org">
Compiling the source you will get the following commands like
<itemize>
<item>sgml2html CVS-HOWTO.sgml     (to generate html file)
<item>sgml2rtf  CVS-HOWTO.sgml     (to generate RTF file)
<item>sgml2latex CVS-HOWTO.sgml    (to generate latex file)
</itemize>

LaTeX documents may be converted into PDF files simply by 
producing a Postscript output using <bf>sgml2latex</bf> ( and dvips) and running the
output through the Acrobat <bf>distill</bf> (<url url="http://www.adobe.com">) command as follows: 
<code>
bash$ man sgml2latex
bash$ sgml2latex filename.sgml
bash$ man dvips
bash$ dvips -o filename.ps filename.dvi
bash$ distill filename.ps
bash$ man ghostscript
bash$ man ps2pdf
bash$ ps2pdf input.ps output.pdf
bash$ acroread output.pdf &
</code>
Or you can use Ghostscript command <bf>ps2pdf</bf>.
ps2pdf is a work-alike for nearly all the functionality of 
Adobe's Acrobat Distiller product: it
converts PostScript files to Portable Document Format (PDF) files. 
<bf>ps2pdf</bf> is implemented as a very small command script (batch file) that invokes Ghostscript, selecting a special "output device"
called <bf>pdfwrite</bf>. In order to use ps2pdf, the pdfwrite device must be included in the makefile when Ghostscript was compiled;
see the documentation on building Ghostscript for details.

From the PHP 3 Manual:
Works only if PHP is an Apache module.
Instead of simply printing out the $PHP_AUTH_USER and $PHP_AUTH_PW, 
you would probably want to check the username and password for 
validity. Perhaps by sending a query to a
database, or by looking up the user in a dbm file.

<code>
<?php
	if (!$PHP_AUTH_USER)
	{
		Header("WWW-authenticate: basic realm=\"My Realm\"");
		Header("HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized");
		echo "Text to send if user hits Cancel button\n";
		exit;
	}
	else
	{
		echo "Hello $PHP_AUTH_USER.<P>";
		echo "You entered $PHP_AUTH_PW as your password.<P>";
	}

To get this file, in the web-browser, save this file as 'Text' type
as network.lib

PHP: network adminstrator's best friend from <url url="http://www.phpWizard.net">

As a web-developer, you're probably used to such lovely tools as ping,
whois, nslookup etc. But what when you need one of those utilities at a
client's office and have no access to telnet? Good guess. Time to look
up the functions in the "Network" section of the PHP manual.

<bf>Socket operations: </bf>

The most important function there is fsockopen(). Using this function,
you can connect to any open port on a server and establish a socket
connection with it. The function's syntax is as following:
<code>
	int fsockopen(string hostname, int port, int [errno], string [errstr]);
</code>
The first two arguments are obvious, the next two are optional and used
for error handling. The "errno" and "errstr" should be passed by reference.
"Passing by reference" means that the original variable will get
modified. Normally, the content of a variable passed to a function
wouldn't be modified.

So, you could use this function to open a connection to a webserver and
print out the headers:
<code>
function get_headers($host, $path = "/")
{
	$fp = fsockopen ("$host", 80, &$errnr, &$errstr) or die("$errno: $errstr");
	fputs($fp,"GET $path HTTP/1.0\n\n");
	while (!$end)
	{
		$line = fgets($fp, 2048);
		if (trim($line) == "")
			$end = true;
		else
			echo $line;
	}
	fclose($fp);
}
</code>
In this example you see that you can apply any file operations (fread,
fwrite etc) to the the pointer you got using the fsockopen() call. Note
that the example realizes a HTTP/1.0 client - it won't work with
name-based virtual hosts.

<bf>Finger: </bf>
Naturally, you can also open connections to other ports. Writing a
small finger client with PHP is trivial therefore. Let's change the
example from above to query a finger daemon:
<code>
function finger ($host, $user)
{
	$fp = fsockopen($host, 79, &$errno, &$errstr) or die("$errno: $errstr");
	fputs($fp, "$user\n");
	while (!feof($fp))
		echo fgets($fp, 128);
	fclose($fp);
}
</code>

<bf>Whois: </bf>
Querying a whois server uses the same concept:
<code>
// domain is like "phpwizard.net"
function whois($domain, $server="whois.internic.net")
{
	$fp = fsockopen ($server, 43, &$errnr, &$errstr) or die("$errno: $errstr");
	fputs($fp, "$domain\n");
	while (!feof($fp))
		echo fgets($fp, 2048);
	fclose($fp);
}
</code>

<bf>Blocking and non-blocking operations: </bf>
But there's a problem with all those functions. They work fine if 
<enum>
<item> You have a conenction with low latency and 
<item> If the server you're connecting to is up and 
running. If not, your script will be busy until
it times out. The reason for this is that default socket connections
are blocking and don't time out. You can avoid these "hanging scripts"
by switching to non-blocking socket operations. The function
set_socket_blocking() does just that: it set all operations on a socket
(first parameter: socket pointer) to either blocking (second parameter:
true) or false (second parameter: false). Using non-blocking
operations, the finger function would like like this:
</enum>

<code>
	$fp = fsockopen($host, 79, &$errno, &$errstr) or die("$errno: [ ] $errstr");
	set_socket_blocking($fp, 0);
	fputs($fp, "$user\n");

	$stop = time() + $timeout;
	while (!feof($fp) && time() < $stop )
		echo fgets($fp, 128);
	fclose($fp);
</code>
Modifying these 3 functions to use non-blocking socket calls is left as
an exercise for you.

<sect> Appendix H Midgard Installation<label id="midgardinstall">
<p>
RPMs for Midgard from  
<url url="http://www.midgard-project.org/download/binaries"> currently do not
include PostgreSQL, and hence you need to install from the source tar 
ball file . 

Download the Midgard source tarball and read the INSTALL.REDHAT file -
<code>
bash# cd midgard-lib-1.4beta6
bash# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-mysql=/usr/local --includedir=/usr/include/mysql --with-midgard=/usr/local --with-pgsql=/var/lib/pgsql --includedir=/usr/include/pgsql
bash# make
bash# make install
bash# ldconfig -v | grep -i midga
Copy the header files, just in case make install did not do that..
bash# cp *.h /usr/local/include


bash# cd ../mod_midgard-1.4beta5c
bash# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-mysql=/usr/local --includedir=/usr/include/mysql --with-midgard=/usr --with-pgsql=/var/lib/pgsql --includedir=/usr/include/pgsql
bash# make
bash# make install
#modify apache line to correct /usr/.....
bash# vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf   (or it is /etc/apache/httpd.conf)
bash# /etc/init.d/apache restart
#apache should restart!!!


bash# cd ../midgard-php-1.4beta6
bash# ./configure '--with-apxs' '--with-mysql' '--with-pgsql' '--with-midgard' --prefix=/usr/local --with-midgard=/usr/local

bash# gvim Makefile
And add -I/usr/include/pgsql to INCLUDE variable.

Also add $(INCLUDE) to $(APXS) command as below - 
libphp3.so: mod_php3.c libmodphp3-so.a  pcrelib/libpcre.a midgard/libphpmidgard.a
	-@test -f ./mod_php3.c || test -L ./mod_php3.c || $(LN_S) $(srcdir)/mod_php3.c ./mod_php3.c
	-@test -f ./mod_php3.c || test -h ./mod_php3.c || $(LN_S) $(srcdir)/mod_php3.c ./mod_php3.c
	$(APXS) -c -o libphp3.so  -I$(srcdir) $(INCLUDE) -I. -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/lib/glib/include  -Wl,'-rpath /usr/local/lib' ./mod_php3.c libmodphp3-so.a $(APXS_LDFLAGS) 

bash# make
bash# make install
#modify apache line to correct /usr/.....
# and add lines like these -
	LoadModule php4_module        modules/libphp4.so
	AddModule mod_php4.c
	LoadModule php4_module        lib/apache/libphp4.so

	&lt
IfModule mod_php4.c>
		AddType application/x-httpd-php4 .php4
		AddType application/x-httpd-php4 .php
		AddType application/x-httpd-php4-source .phps
		AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
	&lt
/IfModule>

bash# vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf   (or it is /etc/apache/httpd.conf)

bash# /etc/init.d/apache restart
#apache should restart!!!

<sect1>Testing Midgard PHP Server<label id = "testmidgard">
<p>
To test the installation do this -
Create a file in your document root directory.  I usually call 
it info.php and in it put this single line:
<code>
&lt
?phpinfo()?>
</code>

Then load it up in your browser: http://localhost/info.php

You should see a nice summary page showing all sorts of information
about your setup.  You probably shouldn't leave this file around on
a production server, but for debugging and general info during 
development, it is very handy.

<sect1>Security OpenSSL <label id = "openssl">
<p>
You may also need to get the RSA package for to enable SSL encryption from
<url url="ftp://ftp.deva.net/pub/sources/crypto/rsaref20.1996.tar.Z">
See also OpenSSL RPM package on Linux cdrom (<url url="http://www.openssl.org">

If you do not want the SSL to be enabled (or if you face any problem), then
download the source RPM of Apache-Midgard and edit the *.spec file and comment
out SSL and rebuild the RPM.
