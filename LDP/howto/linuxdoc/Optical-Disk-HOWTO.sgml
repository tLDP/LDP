<sect>Phase Change Optical Technology 
<p>
<sect1>Introduction
<p>
Optical Phase Change technology is used to create "In Phase" or "Out of
Phase" bits on a special media for phase change writing. The drive uses a
LASER of different power levels or LASER intensities to produce this effect.
One power level allows the media to flow into a crystalline form while the
other creates an "Out of Phase" condition. The crystallized areas reflect the
read Lasers beam with a different coefficient of reflectivity than the
non-crystallized areas. Thus, data can be read from the disk. 

<p>
What makes the phase change optical disk special is that it the disk is
formated with concentric cylinders or tracks with each track being sectored
much like a magnetic disk or read/write optical disk. The tracks are very close
so a lot of data can be stored on a disk. This is different from a CD-ROM in
that it gives your system the look and feel of a magnetic disk. CD-ROMs
have a spiraling track much like a audio record. Having tracks and sectors
alone would not make the phase change drive special from optical disk but the
drive has some very special properties; The phase change drive allows for
direct overwrite of data which magneto optical can't do inexpensively and the
media has the very special property of NOT being susceptible to magnetic
fields or as sensitive to static discharge which gives the media a very long
shelf life. 

<sect1>Panasonic LF1000
<p>
<sect2>POINTS OF INTEREST 
<p>
<itemize>
<item> Read/Write optical disk. 
<item> Can read CD-ROMs at 4X speed. 
<item> Can read Kodak PhotoCDs. 
<item> Media has a 15 Year shelf life. 
<item> SCSI-2 Interface. 
<item> Track/sector format as opposed to CD-ROMs spiraling record format.
<item> 165ms access time - much better than a tape file restore. 
<item> 650Mb data storage per diskette. 
<item> Diskettes are about &dollar;50 each. 
</itemize>

<sect2>THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW 
<p>
<itemize>
<item>Optical disk format not compatible with any other disk drive. 
<item>Vendors don't seem to support UNIX very well - marketing is
   targeted for DOS/Windows and Macintosh. 
<item>Do NOT purchase the PD drive which uses the parallel port
   interface - To my knowledge there is no Linux driver for it.
</itemize>

<sect2>Installation
<p>
The LF1000 is SCSI-2 compatible device. It features a block size of 512 bytes
and is compatible with the Linux SCSI drivers. This drive was installed on a
PC compatible AMD 100MHZ 486 with an Adaptec 1542C SCSI bus-master
controller. To install and mount a disk the following steps were taken; 

<sect2>Installation steps

<p>
<itemize>
<item> Install the drive and set the SCSI address to not interfere with other
   SCSI devices. Reconnect all cabling. 
<item> Boot the computer. Your SCSI controller should note the new drive. 
<item> During the Linux kernel boot, you should see an additional SCSI
   device. In my case, having a magnetic system disk for device /dev/sda
   it shows up as /dev/sdb. 
<item> I did NOT partition the device because fdisk issued an overwrite
   warning and I did not want to change anything from a dosemu
   standpoint. 
<item> mkfs -t ext2 /dev/sdb 
<item> mkdir /pd 
<item> mount -t ext2 -o ro,suid,dev,exec,auto,nouser,async /dev/sdb /pd -
   Read only 
<item> mount -t ext2 -o defaults /dev/sdb /pd - Mount drive W/R 
</itemize>

<em/Your ready to "Rock'n'Roll"/

<sect2>Usage hints 
<p>
<itemize>
<item>The media which comes with the drive is reported be re-writable about
500,000 times. This means that it is not advisable to install a live operating
system such as Linux on the phase change optical drive. These live operating
systems tend to cache processes to and from disk. Over time this can easily
approach the phase change media life. 

<item>Mount drive read only as much as possible. 

<item>When writing to the drive do so in large chunks. This will help 
reduce any file fragmentation which will require more read seeks. 


<item>This is however an excellent media for backups, gifs, mpeg or storing 
large programs which you don't use that often. The restore from backup is much
faster that tape. Backups can be performed using the cp -rp command without
the need for the ftape driver. This however, will replace symbolic links with
the actual file. 
<item>If while using the PD for writing, You find that the file you just
wrote to the disk are not there, chances are that the disk write
protect tab is in write protect mode and you mounted it in read/write mode.
</itemize>

<sect1>Additional Configuration concerns by Jeff Rooze

<p>
Hello,

  I read your article on configuring the Panasonic LF-1000 for
  Linux. I have configured my system so that the optical drive
  has its own device name and the CD-ROM has its own device name. 
  This has allowed me to mount either media at any time. I do not
  require any media in the drive when I boot Linux. Also I am using
  the optical drive as an ext2 formatted media.
<p>
  I had a couple of minor difficulties in doing so.
<p>  
    First, I had configured my hard drive at SCSI ID 6 and my PD
  at SCSI ID 4. (I wanted to have the hard drive at a higher priority
  that the PD). This caused a problem with the Linux SCSI driver. The
  driver scans the SCSI devices from the Lower SCSI id's to the higher
  (eg: 0 .. 6).  Consequently my logical device names were assigned 
  differently depending on which type of media was installed in the
  PD drive. This caused a big problem. My Linux partition is on my 
  SCSI hard drive and the root device name would change! I corrected
  this problem by modifying the software in the kernel SCSI driver to
  scan the devices in reverse order. 
<p>
    Second, the distribution Linux kernel does not scan all SCSI LUNS.
  The PD/CD drive has a mode that establishes the CD-ROM at LUN 1 and
  the PD at LUN 0. This mode is selected by the configuration switches
  on the PD/CD drive. Switch &num;2 should be down (off?). If this switch
  is up (on?), the signature of the device is dependent upon the media
  that is installed and it only reports this device on LUN 0. If no 
  media is installed I think it defaults to CD-ROM.
    I am using an Future Domain 16-xx SCSI interface card and the
  software in Linux kernel driver supports an optical device signature
  when scanning the LUNS. I assume that this is standard for most of 
  the SCSI drivers. I reconfigured the kernel to enable the "scan all
  LUNS" switch. The kernel then assigns different device names for each
  device. The following is an excerpt from by boot log. You will note a
  series of errors in this log. This is because I did not have the
  optical media installed in the drive and the driver was attempting to
  look at the partition table to determine the block size. Fortunately
  it defaults to 512. I am planning on modifying the Future Domain SCSI
  driver to not do this when it detects the optical device.

<p>
   Third, I modified my file system table (/etc/fstab) to list each
   device but do not attempt to auto mount when booting. I have 
   included an excerpt from my fstab. The most important options
   are the noauto, rw(ro), and the checkpass flag.
<p>
   To create a ext2 file system on the PD, I used the command
   "mkfs.ext2 -i 2048 /dev/sdb".

<tscreen><verb>
# fstab - List of file systems
#
# device  mount   type          options              dumpfrequency
checkpass
/dev/sdb /optd    ext2   rw,user,suid,noauto,sync,exec,dev,umask=0 0 2
/dev/sr0 /dist  iso9660  ro,user,suid,noauto,sync,exec,dev 0 2
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
  After making these changes, I have had no problems with mounting
  either media. All I need to do is to load the media and type
  "mount /optd" or "mount /dist" and the system does all the rest.
<p>
  I hope this information is useful.

<p>
I tried Jeff's suggestion. Here are the steps I performed;
<itemize>
<item>Modify my kernel using "make xconfig" in the /usr/src/linux directory 
and installed it. 
<item>Change the mode jumper on the PD drive to non-DOS mode. I soldered
a switch across the mode jumper connections and routed it the the
back panel. I figured out which switch position was the open position
and labeled this one for DOS.  The other position is of course Linux.
So before I boot my system I decide which OS I'll be using and set the
switch accordingly. History shows it staying in the Linux position
more and more.
<item> Reboot your system. You should now see multiple LUN show up 
during boot for the PD SCSI device number - It works great!!! If you have 
an older kernel modify the "/usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi/config.in" file.
<item>Update the fstab for both CD and PD drives.
<item>Use appropriate mount command.
<item>"df" to make sure your ready.
</itemize>

I did try moving my primary SCSI drive to 6 but experienced some
difficulties. Can't remember exactly what it was but it may have
been that my controller "Adaptec 1542" with "Corel SCSI" requires a
bootable disk and SCSI 0 for the BIOS install to work properly with
DOS. So I switched it back and enjoyed playing with my properly
install PD drive! With this configuration "workman" - the audio
CD player util - works fine.

<sect>Magneto Optical Technology
<p>
<sect1>Introduction 
<p>
Magneto optical drives use a "Far field" magnetic field and a laser
to change polarization of a magnetic media. The media is of such a 
nature that it must be heated to the appropriate temperature before a
polarization change can happen - this is where the laser comes into play. A
high power write laser is used to heat the disk surface to the appropriate
temperature at which time the "Far field" can set the polarization
on the disk magnetic surface. After a short period of time the disk
surface cools and "locks" the polarization into place. The read back
I'm a little fuzzy on - someone please send me the proper wording.
I think a low power laser is used for read back and the "H" field
of the disk polarization interacts with the "E" and "H" field of the
incident laser to produce a reflective polarization which will correspond
to the disk bit polarization - I hope this is in the ball-park, it's
certainly no home run. Maybe a total strike out.
<p>
The use of a laser for polarization change allows the disk bit and
track densities to be higher than conventional "Flying" magnetic
heads. The "far field" means no more "head crashes" - that is assuming
your disk label doesn't peal off during the load or you don't
leave one of those sticky pads on the disk cartridge. Most media
allows 650 Megs per platter and on some models both sides of the
media is used yielding 1.3Gig storage media - you must remove the
media and flip it over to use the other 650Megs though.

Hi

I have noticed that there is not much information about
magneto-optical disks in the howto, which may be due to the fact that
these are not very popular in general. In Japan, MO drives are very
common, especially the 3.5' variety with media in 128MB (maybe not
available anymore), 230MB, and recently 640MB sizes. I suppose there
is plenty of info on usage of these drives with Linux in Japanese -
but that does not help most people for some reason ;-) MODs can be
used very much like any removable media and are handy for smaller
backups as the media are relatively inexpensive (about 10US$ / 640MB
as of 10-98). I can only comment on the usage of 230MB drives with
SCSI interface.

Drives used: several, no problems encountered (Olympus, Epson, currently
Mitsubishi MK230LK3). Drives may have strange jumper setting like "Mac
Mode" or such - naturally, disable. 
If you decide to get a drive, pay attention the the
cache size - It can speed things up enormously, still speed will be
soso compared to hard disks, of course. 

SCSI controllers: NCR53C810-based (Asus PCI-200), Adaptec APA-1460A,
Adaptec AHA2940. 

Just install the drive as you would do with an additional SCSI hard
disk. It will show up as such. You don't need a disk in the drive when
booting. 

There are two ways to format the disks:
a) A bit like a floppy. Just run mkfs on the raw device i.e. something like
sdb or sdc. I don't recommend this in general (see below).
b) Like a hard disk. Do fdisk on the raw device and then mkfs on the
partition as you would for a hard disk (like sdc0, I have never made
multiple partitions on a MOD). 

What I have not tried is to boot from MOD, yet I cannot see why it
should not work. I would only recommend it for emergency system
recovery, however, due to MO drive performance.

Note: Purchased disks for Doze or Windog may be formatted "like
floppies" and cannot be used with either O(gre)S right away while MODs
formatted under linux as hard disks (partition FAT16 / type 6 and
mkdosfs) will work fine (only tested with NT 3.5/4.0).  Fdisk will
issue a warning upon exit that concerned FAT16 partitions and you do
better to take it seriously (look at the fdisk man-page).  The sector
size will not be automatically set properly for mkdosfs. Use "mkdosfs
-s 8". That came from some Japanese Web site in mid 1995 (Thanks to Ken
Kawabata for finding and deciphering it). Using the vfat file-system
with the disks works fine. I have only used FAT/DOSfs or Linux/ext2
formatted disks so far.

Additional Note: The media are probably a bit sensitive. Of course to
magnetic fields, but also to mechanical stress, some formats seem
to be more fragile than others (Mac format seemingly worst, data loss has
occurred when dropping disks during sneaker net traffic).


Though this does not steer anyone through particularly dense
jungle, it may be nice for completeness.

---------------- December 11 1998 update from Steve -------------------

OK, some problems will arise with MO disks occasionally. the safest
way to avoid them is not to use the disks "off the shelf".  trying to
mount disks can even result in kernel panics. i accidentally tried to
mount a 640MB disk (format windows95 it said, so maybe FAT32) as -t
vfat, this is not a thing to try.

also, 2.0.x kernels don't support 2048b block size (also 640MB disks).
a patch for 2.0.3x kernels seems to float around somewhere in Japan,
but i have not yet gotten hold of it.  here a link that certainly has
an English description:
http://elektra.e-technik.uni-ulm.de/~mbuck/linux/patches.html
or search the u-tokyo.ac.jp domain. the page of the developers is
hidden somewhere. 

the best way to use these 640MB disks is therefore to do fdisk and
mkfs first. i have only done this with mke2fs on type 83 partitions:
mke2fs -b 2048 /dev/sdxy

i will check it out for FAT16 partitions and mkdosfs when i have some
spare time and disks. 

my kernel version used is 2.1.124 (for all of the above).

<sect1>Fujitsu DynaMO 640 - Phil Garcia
<p>
<htmlurl url="mailto:pgarcia@execpc.com" name="pgarcia@execpc.com">
<verb>
  You've probably already received a number of messages regarding the
Fujitsu DynaMO 640 - I have the 640SZI, which is the internal version;
the model number given in a SCSI probe is M2513-MCC3064SS.  I recently
installed this drive practically without a hitch.  I say practically
because the sector size of the 640 MB disks is 2048 bytes, which is
not supported in the Linux 2.0.x kernel but is supported in the
development kernels.  A patch for 2.0.x is available at
http://wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~orschaer/mo/
-- also at this site is a patched fdisk to use in conjunction with it.

Otherwise, installing the drive was no different from installing a
SCSI hard drive.  It runs well, and I'm very happy with it.

<sect>Optical jukeboxes
<p>
I have no experience with optical jukeboxes with Linux!!!!
I have had experiences with Optical jukeboxes under HP-UX. In this
setup the the jukebox had a SCSI address of it's own. Each slot in 
the jukebox had an associated LUN number. A device name was assigned
for each disk slot A side and B side. The mount command was run against
the appropriate device name. I had a jukebox with just one drive and
16 optical disk slots - 20 Gig. I thought it was going to be a real hassle
to write a disk mount manager to share this drive among users until
I discovered you can mount as many disk as you want and the jukebox
driver takes care of arbitration - what a nice feature. Granted, you
only want archive type data here and your overall system configuration
to be such that not too many processes will be accessing the jukebox at the 
same time. The disk spin down, carriage load, carriage move, carriage unload,
carriage move to the next disk, carriage next disk load, carriage move,
optical drive load, and spin up takes about 12 seconds - "seek-from-hell".

Hi,
   
I was reading your howto (a life saver, thanks) and I was wondering what
kind of jukebox you were running?  I have a Maxoptix 520 Jukebox (20
disks at 2.6G each, nice!) and I would like to connect it to a Linux box
and serve the drives up to my users, but I'm having problems accessing
the individual drives.   Currently I can only access the two drives and
something called MAXLYB which I think is a controller device of some
sort.
   
Basically, I'm wondering if the jukebox you had was the same or similar
and how you set it up.  I know that you did it under HP-UX, but any help
right now would be nice.  Hey, I'll even let you log into my linux
server if you want to take a look at the jukebox and see what it does.
You can't beat 52Gig of storage!

Anyway, I'd really appreciate your help.

Yep, that's the one.

What I've come to find out is that Maxoptix is pretty stingy when it 
comes to drivers.  Apparently, they don't make driver software for any of 
their Jukebox carriage controller interfaces!  I don't know how some of 
these companies stay in business.  I'm going to pester them again soon, 
but you are right, this thing will need a carriage controller driver to 
operate.  The cool thing is that this MX520 (that's the model number of 
the juke) emulates a whole slew of other carriage controllers, so maybe 
one of those other guys has a driver.  I'll be looking into that too.

Hey, if I can't find any driver software, and I can convince Maxoptix to 
give me the specs, I'd be more than glad to write a driver.  I'd could 
sure use the help too since I haven't got enough time to do it on my 
own.  Also, do you know of anyone else doing this that we might be able 
to hack off of?

Sure, but let me get some new information first.  So far things are 
looking pretty bleak.

Oh, I don't have this thing at home.  There's no way I could afford the 
$30,000 my boss paid for this thing.  But he's stuck with it and has had 
it sitting around collecting dust for a year, so he's letting me play 
with it and try to find a use for it.

I'll get back with you when I have some more information.  It should be 
sometime this week when I find out if I can get it to work or not.
