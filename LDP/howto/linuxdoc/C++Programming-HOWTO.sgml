This document discusses methods to avoid memory problems in C++ and 
also will help you to program properly in C++ language. 
The information in this document applies to all the operating sytems 
that is - Linux, MS DOS, Apple Macintosh OS, Windows 95/NT, 
OS/2, IBM OSes, VMS, Novell Netware, all flavors of 
Unix like Solaris, HPUX, AIX, SCO, Sinix, BSD, etc.. and to 
all other operating systems which support "C++" compiler (it 
means almost all the operating systems on this planet!).

<chapt>Introduction
-->
<sect>Introduction
<p>
C++ is the most popular language and will be used for a long time in the future
inspite of emergence of Java. C++ runs <bf>extremely fast</bf> and is 
in fact <bf> 20 to 30 times FASTER than </bf> Java. Java runs very slow 
because it is an byte-code-interpreted language running on top of "virtual engine". The 
memory management in Java is automated, so that programmers do not directly
deal with memory allocations. This document attempts
to automate the memory management in C++ to make it much more easy to use.
A neat feature of Java is that memory allocations are taken care of automatically.
This howto will enable "C++" to "compete/imitate" with Java language in memory management.

Because of manual memory allocations, debugging the C++ programs consumes a 
major portion of time. The information 
in this document will give you some better ideas and tips to reduce the debugging time.

<sect1>Problems facing the current C++ compilers
<p>
Since C++ is super-set of C, it got all the bad features of "C" language.

For example, in "C" programming - memory leaks, memory overflows are very common due
to usage of features like -
<code>
	Datatype  char * and char[]
	String functions like strcpy, strcat, strncpy, strncat, etc..
	Memory functions like malloc, realloc, strdup, etc..
</code>

The usage of <bf>char *</bf> and <bf>strcpy</bf> causes <it>horrible</it> memory 
problems due to <it>"overflow"</it>, 
<it>"fence past errors"</it> or  <it>"memory leaks"</it>.
The memory problems are extremely hard to debug and are 
very time consuming to fix and trouble-shoot. Memory problems bring down
the productivity of programmers. This document helps in increasing the
productivity of programmers via different methods addressed to solve the
memory defects in "C++".
Memory related bugs are very tough to crack, and even experienced programmers 
take several days, weeks or months to debug memory related problems. Many times memory 
bugs will be "hiding" in the code for several months and can cause unexpected
program crashes!! The usage of 
<bf>char *</bf> 
is costing USA and Japan $2 billion 
every year in time lost in debugging and downtime of programs. If you use
<bf>char *</bf> 
in C++ then it is a very costly affair especially if your programs have more
than a million lines of code.

Hence, the following techniques are proposed to overcome the faults of "C"
language.

It is proposed that C++ compilers should prevent the programmers
from using the 
<bf>"char *"</bf>
, <bf>"char[]"</bf> datatypes and 
functions like <bf>strcpy</bf>, <bf>strcat</bf>, 
<bf>strncpy</bf>, <bf>strncat</bf>.
The datatypes like char *, char[] and functions like strcpy, strcat 
are <bf>evil</bf> and must be completetly <bf>BANNED</bf> from usage in C++!!
The
<bf>"char *"</bf>
is like <it>smallpox virus</it> and it must be eradicated from this world!!

Instead of using char * and char[] all the C++ programmers MUST use the 
<bf>'mychar class'</bf> 
which is given in this document and
<bf>'string class'</bf> 
included in the STDLIB.
The 
<bf>'mychar class'</bf> 
utilises the constructor and destructor to automate the memory management
and also provides many functions like <it>ltrim</it>, <it>substring</it>,
etc.. 

See also related 
<bf>'string class'</bf> 
in 
the C++ compiler. The <bf>string class</bf> is part of the standard GNU C++ 
library and provides lot of string manipulation functions. The
<bf>'string class'</bf> and 
<bf>'mychar class'</bf> 
can remove the need of <bf>char *</bf> datatype.
Also, C++ programmers must be encouraged to use 'new', 'delete' 
features instead of using 'malloc' or 'free'.

The 
<bf>'mychar class'</bf> 
does everything 
that <bf>char *</bf> or <bf>char []</bf> does. It can 
completely replace <bf>char</bf> datatype. Plus added 
benefit is that programmers do not have to worry 
about the memory problems and memory allocation at all!!

The GNU C++ compiler MUST drop off the support of <bf>char *, char[]</bf> 
datatypes and in order to compile older programs using <bf>char</bf> datatype, 
the compiler should provide a additional option called "-fchar-datatype" to g++ command.
Over the next 2 years all the C++ programs will use 
<bf>'mychar class'</bf> 
and 
<bf>'string class'</bf> 
and there will be no char * and char[]. The compiler 
should try to prevent bad programming practices!

<sect1>Which one "C", "C++" or Java ?
<p>
It is recommended you do programming in object-oriented "C++" for all your
application programming or general purpose programming. You can take full
advantage of object oriented facilities of C++. The C++ compiler is lot
more complex than "C" compiler and C++ programs may run bit slower than "C"
programs. But compiler optimizer options like -O or -O3 can speed up C++.

Nowadays, "C" language is primarily used for "systems programming" to develop
operating sytems, device drivers etc..

Java is platform independent language more suitable for developing GUI running
inside web-browsers (Java applets) but runs very slow. Prefer to 
use web-server-side programming "Fast-CGI" with C++ and HTML, DHTML, 
XML to get better performance. Hence, the golden rule is <it>"Web-server side programming
use C++ and web-client side (browser) programming use Java applets"</it>. The 
reason is - the server-side OS is under your control and never changes and you
will never know what the client side web-browser OS is. It can be Windows 95/98/NT/2000
or Linux, Apple Mac, OS/2, Solaris etc..

<chapt> Usage of mychar class
-->
<sect> Usage of mychar class
<p>
The
<bf>'mychar class'</bf> 
is a complete replacement for char and char * datatype.
You can use
<bf>'mychar class'</bf> 
just like char and get much more functionalities. 
You should include the library 'libmychar.a' which you can build from the
makefile given in 
<ref id ="Appendix H" name="Appendix H"> and copy the library to
/usr/lib directory where all the "C++" libraries are located. To use 
the 'libmychar.a' compile your programs like -
<code>
	g++ example.cpp -lmychar
</code>
See illustration sample code as given below -
<code>
	mychar aa;

	aa = " Washington DC is the capital of USA ";

	// You can use aa.val like a 'char *' variable in programs !!
	for (unsigned long tmpii = 0; tmpii < aa.length(); tmpii++)
	{
		fprintf(stdout, "aa.val[%ld]=%c ", tmpii, aa.val[tmpii]);
	}

	// Using pointers on 'char *' val ...
	for (; *aa.val != 0; aa.val++)
	{
		fprintf(stdout, "aa.val=%c ", *aa.val);
	}
</code>
A complete 
example program "example_mychar.cpp" implementing the 
mychar class is given in 
<ref id ="Appendix A" name="Appendix A">
and mychar class is given in
<ref id ="Appendix B" name="Appendix B">.

provides these operators :-
<itemize>
<item> Equal to <bf>==</bf> 
<item> Not equal to <bf>!=</bf> 
<item> Assignment <bf>=</bf>  
<item> Add to itself and Assignment <bf>+=</bf> 
<item> String concatenation or addition <bf>+</bf>  
</itemize>
For example to use operators -
<code>
	mychar aa;
	mychar bb("Bill Clinton");

	aa = "put some value string";  // assignment operator
	aa += "add some more"; // Add to itself and assign operator
	aa = "My name is" + " Alavoor Vasudevan "; // string cat operator

	if (bb == "Bill Clinton")  // boolean equal to operator
		cout << "bb is eqaul to 'Bill Clinton' " << endl;

	if (bb != "Al Gore")   // boolean 'not equal' to operator
		cout << "bb is not equal to 'Al Gore'" << endl;

<sect1> Miscellaneous Functions
<p>
Some miscellaneous mychar functions are given here, but <bf>DO NOT USE</bf> these, 
and instead use operators  like '+', '+=', '==' etc.. These are 'private' members of
the 'mychar' class.
<itemize>
<item> Copy string <bf>str_cpy(char *bb)</bf>
<item> Long integer converted to string <bf>str_cpy(unsigned long bb)</bf>
<item> Integer converted to string <bf>str_cpy(int bb)</bf>
<item> Float converted to string <bf>str_cpy(float bb)</bf>
<item> String concatenate a char * <bf>str_cat(char *bb)</bf>
<item> String concatenate a int <bf>str_cat(int bb)</bf>
<item> String concatenate a int <bf>str_cat(unsigned long bb)</bf>
<item> String concatenate a float <bf>str_cat(float bb)</bf>
<item> Is equal to mychar ? <bf>bool equalto(const mychar & rhs, bool type = false)</bf>
<item> Is equal to char* ? <bf>bool equalto(const char *rhs, bool type = false)</bf>
</itemize>
For example to convert integer to string do -
<code>
	mychar	aa;

	aa = 34;  // The '=' operator will convert int to string
	cout << "The value of aa is : " << aa.val << endl;

	aa = 234.878;  // The '=' operator will convert float to string
	cout << "The value of aa is : " << aa.val << endl;

	aa = 34 + 234.878;
	cout << "The value of aa is : " << aa.val << endl;
	// The output aa will be '268.878'

	// You must cast mychar to convert
	aa = (mychar) 34 + " Honourable President Ronald Reagan " + 234.878;
	cout << "The value of aa is : " << aa.val << endl;
	// The output aa will be '34 Honourable President Ronald Reagan 234.878'
</code>

<chapt> C++ Zap (Delete) command <label id="zap">
-->
<sect> C++ Zap (Delete) command <label id="zap">
<p>
The 
<bf>delete</bf> and
<bf>new</bf> 
commands in C++ are much better than the malloc and free functions of "C".
Consider using new and zap (delete command) instead of malloc and free 
as much as possible.

To make 
<bf>delete</bf> 
command even more cleaner, make a Zap() command. Define 
a zap() command like this: 
<code>
/* 
** Use do while to make it robust and bullet-proof macro.
** For example, if "do-while" is NOT used then results will be
** something else just as in -
** if (bbint == 4)
**		aa = 0
** else
**		zap(aptr);  // Problem!! aptr will be always set to NULL 
*/

#define zap(x) do { delete(x); x = NULL; } while (0)
</code>

The zap() command will delete the pointer and set it NULL.
This will ensure that even if multiple zap()'s are called on the
same deleted pointer then the
program will not crash. For example -

<code>
	zap(pFirstname);
	zap(pFirstname); // no core dumps !! Because pFirstname is NULL now
	zap(pFirstname); // no core dumps !! Because pFirstname is NULL now

	zap(pLastname);
	zap(pJobDescription);
</code>

There is nothing magical about this, it just saves 
repetative code, saves typing time and makes programs more readable. The
C++ programmers often forget to reset the deleted pointer
to NULL, and this causes annoying
problems causing core dumps and crashes. The zap() takes care of 
this automatically.
Do not stick a typecast in the zap() command -- if something errors out on the 
above zap() command it likely has another error somewhere.

Also 
<ref id="my_malloc" name="my_malloc()">
, my_realloc() and my_free() should be used 
instead of malloc(), realloc() and free(), as they
are much cleaner and have additional checks. 
For an example, see the file "mychar.h" which is using 
the 
<ref id="my_malloc" name="my_malloc()">
and my_free() functions.

<chapt> Pointers are problems <label id="pointers">
-->
<sect> Pointers are problems <label id="pointers">
<p>
A <bf>reference</bf> is an alias; when you create a reference, you initialize
it with the name of another object, the target. From the moment on, the reference
acts as an alternative name of the target, and anything you do to the reference
is really done to the target.

Avoid using pointers as much as possible and use references. Pointers are really a
great pain. It is possible to write a application without using pointers.
In languages like Java, pointers are not supported at all !!

<bf>Syntax of References:</bf> Declare a reference by writing the type, followed by
the reference operator (&), followed by the reference name. References
<bf>MUST</bf> be initialized at the time of creation.
For example -
<code>
	int		weight;
	int 	& rweight = weight;

	DOG		aa;
	DOG & rDogRef = aa;
</code>

<it>Do's</it> of references -
<itemize>
<item>Do use references to create an alias to an object
<item>Do initialize all references
<item>Do use references for high efficiency and performance of program.
<item>Do use <bf>const</bf> to protect references and pointers whenever possible.
</itemize>

<it>Do not's</it> of references -
<itemize>
<item><bf>IMPORTANT: </bf>Don't use references to NULL objects !!!!
<item>Don't confuse the address of operator &amp with reference operator !! The references
are used in the declarations section (see Syntax of References above).
<item>Don't try to reassign a reference
<item>Don't use pointers if references will work
<item>Don't return a reference to a local object
<item>Don't pass by reference if the item referred to may go out of scope

<chapt> Usage of my_malloc and my_free <label id="my_malloc">
-->
<sect> Usage of my_malloc and my_free <label id="my_malloc">
<p>
Try to avoid using malloc and realloc as much as possible and use <bf>new</bf>
and <bf><ref id="zap" name="zap">(delete)</bf>. But sometimes you may need to 
use the "C" style memory allocations in "C++". Use the functions 
<bf>my_malloc()</bf> ,
<bf>my_realloc()</bf> and
<bf>my_free()</bf>. 
These functions do proper allocations and initialisations and try to prevent 
memory problems. Also these functions (in DEBUG mode) can keep track 
of memory allocated and print total memory usage before and after the program
is run. This tells you if there are any memory leaks.

The my_malloc and my_realloc is defined as below. It allocates little more memory
(SAFE_MEM = 5) and initializes the space and if it cannot allocate it exits the
program. The 'call_check(), remove_ptr()' functions are active only when DEBUG is defined in 
makefile and are assigned to 
((void)0) i.e. NULL
for non-debug production release. They enable the total-memory used tracing.

<code>
void *local_my_malloc(size_t size, char fname[], int lineno) 
{
	size_t  tmpii = size + SAFE_MEM;
	void *aa = NULL;
	aa = (void *) malloc(tmpii);
	if (aa == NULL)
		raise_error_exit(MALLOC, VOID_TYPE, fname, lineno);
	memset(aa, 0, tmpii);
	call_check(aa, tmpii, fname, lineno);
	return aa;
}

char *local_my_realloc(char *aa, size_t size, char fname[], int lineno)
{
	remove_ptr(aa, fname, lineno);
	unsigned long tmpjj = 0;
	if (aa) // aa !=  NULL
		tmpjj = strlen(aa);
	unsigned long tmpqq = size + SAFE_MEM;
	size_t  tmpii = sizeof (char) * (tmpqq);
	aa = (char *) realloc(aa, tmpii);
	if (aa == NULL)
		raise_error_exit(REALLOC, CHAR_TYPE, fname, lineno);

	// do not memset!! memset(aa, 0, tmpii);
	aa[tmpqq-1] = 0;
	unsigned long kk = tmpjj;
	if (tmpjj > tmpqq)
		kk = tmpqq;
	for ( ; kk < tmpqq; kk++)
		aa[kk] = 0;
	call_check(aa, tmpii, fname, lineno);
	return aa;
}
</code>
See 
<ref id ="Appendix D" name="my_malloc.cpp">.
and the header file
<ref id ="Appendix E" name="my_malloc.h">.
for full implementation of the my_malloc program.

An example on usage of my_malloc and my_free as below:
<code>
	char 	*aa;
	int 	*bb;
	float	*cc;
	aa = (char *) my_malloc(sizeof(char)* 214);
	bb = (int *) my_malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);
	cc = (float *) my_malloc(sizeof(int) * 20);

	aa = my_realloc(aa, sizeof(char) * 34);
	bb = my_realloc(bb, sizeof(int) * 14);
	cc = my_realloc(cc, sizeof(float) * 10);
</code>
Note that in my_realloc you do not need to cast the datatype as the
variable itself is passed and correct my_realloc is called which
returns the proper datatype pointer. The my_realloc has overloaded
functions for char*, int* and float*.

<chapt> Debug files
-->
<sect> Debug files
<p>
To debug any C++ or C programs include the file 
<ref id="Appendix F" name="debug.h">
and in your 'Makefile' define DEBUG to turn on the traces from the debug.h functions.
When you remove the '-DDEBUG' then the debug function calls are set to 
((void)0) i.e. NULL,
hence it has no impact on final production release version of project. You can generously
use the debug functions in your programs and it will not increase the size of production
executable.

See the file
<ref id="Appendix G" name="debug.cpp"> 
for implementation of debug routines.
And see the file
<ref id="Appendix D" name="my_malloc.cpp">
for sample which uses debug.h and debug functions.
