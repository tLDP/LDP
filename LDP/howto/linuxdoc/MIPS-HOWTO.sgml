<title>Linux/MIPS HOWTO
<author>Ralf B&auml;chle, <tt/ralf@gnu.org/
<date>November 12, 2000
<abstract>
This FAQ describes the MIPS port of the Linux operating system, common
problems and their solutions, availability and more.  It also tries to
be helpful to other people who might read this FAQ in an attempt to
find information that actually should be covered elsewhere.
</abstract>
<toc>
<sect>What is Linux/MIPS?<p>
 Linux/MIPS is a port of the widespread UNIX clone Linux to the MIPS
 architecture.  Linux/MIPS is running on a large number of technically very
 different systems ranging from small embedded systems and servers to large
 desktop machines and servers that, at least at the time when they were
 introduced into the market, were the best of their class.<p>

 Linux/MIPS advantages over other operating systems at this time are
 <itemize>
 <item>The entire Linux system consists only of Free Software.
 <item>Excellent Price/Performance ratio.
 <item>Availability of large amounts of software of which a large part
       again is Free Software.
 <item>Binary compatibility across a growing number of platforms.
 <item>Small footprint making Linux/MIPS suitable for many embedded systems.
 </itemize>

 In short, Linux has been designed and ships with Fahrvergn&uuml;gen.
 However, as usual your mileage may vary and you should examine the
 suitability of Linux for your task - something which we hope this document 
 helps you to accomplish.<p>

<sect>What hardware does Linux/MIPS support?
 <sect1>Hardware Platforms<p>
 <label id="hardware-platforms">
 <p>
  Many machines are available with a number of different CPU options of which
  not all are currently supported.  Please check section
  <ref id="supported-cpus" name="Processor Types"> to make sure your CPU type
  is supported.  This is a listing of machines that are running
  Linux/MIPS, systems to which Linux/MIPS could be ported, or systems that
  people have an interest in running Linux/MIPS.

  <sect2>Acer PICA<p>
  The <em>Acer PICA</em> is derived from the <em>Mips Magnum 4000</em> design.
  It has a R4400PC CPU running at 133MHz or optionally 150MHz plus a 512KB
  (optionally 2MB) second level cache; the Magnum's G364 gfx card was replaced
  with a S3 968 based one.  The system is supported with the exception of the
  X server.

  <sect2>Baget/MIPS series<p>
  The Baget series includes several boxes which have R3000 processors: Baget 
  23, Baget 63, and Baget 83.  Baget 23 and 63 have BT23-201 or BT23-202
  motherboards with R3500A (which is basically a R3000A chip) at 25 MHz and
  R3081E at 50 MHz respectively.  The BT23-201 board has VME bus and VIC068,
  VAC068 chips as system controllers.  The BT23-202 board has PCI as internal
  bus and VME as internal.
  Support for BT23-201 board has been done by <htmlurl
  url="mailto:rajko@mech.math.msu.su"
  name="Gleb Raiko (rajko@mech.math.msu.su)"> and
  <htmlurl url="mailto:vroganov@msiu.ru"
  name="Vladimir Roganov (vroganov@msiu.ru)">
  with a bit of help from <htmlurl url="mailto:zimin@msiu.ru"
  name="Serguei Zimin (zimin@msiu.ru)">.  Support for BT23-202 is under
  development along with Baget 23B which consists of 3 BT23-201 boards
  with shared VME bus.<p>

  Baget 83 is mentioned here for completeness only. It has only 2MB RAM and
  it's too small to run Linux.  The Baget/MIPS code has been merged with the
  DECstation port. The source for both is available at
  <url url="http://decstation.unix-ag.org/">.

  <sect2>Cobalt Qube and Raq<p>
  The Cobalt&nbsp;Qube product series are low cost headless server systems
  based on a IDT&nbsp;R5230.  Cobalt has developed its own Linux/MIPS
  variant to fit the special requirements of the Qube as well as possible.
  Basically, the Qube kernel was derived from Linux/MIPS 2.1.56,
  backported to 2.0.30 for stability's sake, then optimized.  Cobalt kernels
  are available from Cobalt's ftp site <url url="http://www.cobaltnet.com">.
  The Cobalt Qube support has never been integrated into the official
  Linux/MIPS 2.1.x kernels.

  <sect2>NEC machines<p>
  The NEC uniprocessor machines are OEM <em>Acer PICA</em> systems, see
  that section for details.  The SMP systems are different from that.  The
  Linux/MIPS developers have no technical documentation as necessary to write
  an OS.  As long as that does not change, this will pretty much stay a show-
  stopper, preventing a port to NEC's SMP systems.

  <sect2>NEC VR41xx-based platforms<p>
  The Linux VR project is porting Linux to devices based on the NEC VR41xx
  microprocessors.  Many of these devices were originally designed to run
  Windows&nbsp;CE.  The project has produced working kernels with basic drivers
  for the Vadem Clio, Casio E-105, Everex Freestyle, and more.  For more
  information please see <url url="http://linux-vr.org/">.

  <sect2>Toshiba TMPR39xx/Philips PR31700 platforms<p>
  Similar to the VR41xx, devices with these processors were originally intended
  for running Windows&nbsp;CE. However, there are working kernels with basic drivers
  for <em>Sharp Mobilon</em> and the <em>Compaq C-Series</em>. Support for more devices
  is under construction. The code is part of the Linux VR project and as such
  more information can be found at <url url="http://linux-vr.org/">.

  <sect2>Netpower 100<p>
  The <em>Netpower 100</em> is apparently an <em>Acer PICA</em> in disguise.
  It should therefore be supported but this is untested.  If there is a
  problem then it is probably the machine detection.

  <sect2>Nintendo 64<p>
  The <em>Nintendo 64</em> is R4300-based game console with 4MB RAM.  Its
  graphics chips were developed by Silicon Graphics for Nintendo.  Right now
  this port has pipe dream status and will continue to be in that state until
  Nintendo decides to publish the necessary technical information.  The
  question remains as to whether porting the Linux/MIPS code to this platform
  is a good idea.

  <sect2>Silicon Graphics Challenge S<p>
  This machine is very similar to the Indy, the differences are that it doesn't
  have a keyboard or graphics card, but has an additional SCSI WD33C95-based
  adapter.  This WD33C95 hostadapter is currently not supported.

  <sect2>Silicon Graphics Indigo<p>
  This machine is only being mentioned here because people have occasionally
  confused it with Indys or the Indigo&nbsp;2.  The Indigo is a different
  R3000-based architecture however, and is not yet unsupported.

  <sect2>Silicon Graphics Indigo2<p>
  This machine is the successor to the Indigo and is very similar to the Indy.
  It is now supported, but is lacking in several areas. You will have 
  to use serial console. If you have an Indigo2 and still want to run Linux on 
  it, contact either <htmlurl url="mailto:flo@rfc822.org"
  name="Florian Lohoff (flo@rfc822.org)"> or <htmlurl
  url="mailto:spock@mgnet.de" name="Klaus Naumann (spock@mgnet.de)"> .

  <sect2>Silicon Graphics Indy<p>
  The Indy is currently the only (mostly) supported Silicon Graphics
  machine.  The only supported graphics card is the Newport card, a.k.a.
  ``XL'' graphics.  The Indy is available with a large number of
  CPU options at various clock rates, all of which are supported.  
  There is also a X server available, now written by 
  <htmlurl url="mailto:guido.guenther@gmx.net" 
  name="Guido Guenther (guido.guenther@gmx.net)">.
  If you're able to use the Newport console on your Indy it should be 
  possible to also use this X server. It's based on XFree86 4.0 and 
  currently runs at snail-like speeds, but it seems to work quite well.
  If you want to try it, take a look at 
  <url url="http://honk.physik.uni-konstanz.de/~agx/mipslinux/x/"> .

   <sect3>Strange amounts of available memory<p>
   On bootup, the kernel on the Indy will report available memory with a
   message like:
   <verb>
   Memory: 27976k/163372k available (1220k kernel code, 2324k data)
   </verb>
   The large difference between the first pair of numbers is caused by a
   128MB area in the Indy's memory address space which mirrors up to the
   first 128MB of memory.  The difference between the two numbers will
   always be about 128MB and does not indicate a problem of any kind.
   Kernels since 2.3.23 don't count this 128MB gap any more.

   <sect3>Indy PROM related problems<p>
   Several people have reported these problems with their machines after
   upgrading them typically from surplus parts.  There are several PROM
   versions for the Indy available.  Machines with old PROM versions which
   have been upgraded to newer CPU variants, like a R4600SC or R5000SC module,
   can crash during the self test with an error message like:
   <verb>
   Exception: <vector=Normal>
   Status register: 0x30004803<CU1,CU0,IM7,IM4,IPL=???,MODE=KERNEL,EXL,IE>
   Cause register: 0x4000<CE=0,IP7,EXC=INT>
   Exception PC: 0xbfc0b598
   Interrupt exception
   CPU Parity Error Interrupt
   Local I/O interrupt register 1: 0x80 <VR/GIO2>
   CPU parity error register: 0x80b<B0,B1,B3,SYSAD_PAR>
   CPU parity error: address: 0x1fc0b598
   NESTED EXCEPTION #1 at EPC: 9fc3df00; first exception at PC: bfc0b598
   </verb>
   In that case, you'll have to upgrade your machine's PROM to a newer version,
   or go back to an older CPU version (usually R4000SC or R4400SC modules
   should work).  Just to be clear, this is a problem which is unrelated to 
   Linux, it is only mentioned here because several Linux users have asked
   about it.<p>

   <sect3>ELF support in old PROM versions<p>
   Old PROM versions don't know about the ELF binary format which the Linux
   kernel uses, so Linux cannot boot directly.  The preferable solution
   for this is of course a PROM upgrade.  Alternatively, you can use Sash for
   IRIX 5 or newer to boot the kernel.  Sash knows how to load ELF binaries
   and doesn't care if it's an IRIX or Linux kernel.  Simply type
   ``Sash'' to the PROM monitor.  You should get another shell
   prompt, this time from Sash.  Now launch Linux as usual.<p> Sash can read
   EFS or XFS filesystems or read the kernel from bootp / tftp.  That means
   if you intend to use Sash for booting the kernel from local disk, you'll
   still have to have a minimal IRIX installation on your system.

   <sect3>Why is so much memory reserved on my Indy?<p>
   On bootup, the `Memory: ...' message on an Indy says that there is
   128MB of RAM reserved.  That is ok. Just like the PC architecture has
   a gap in its memory address space between 640KB and 1024KB, the Indy
   has a 128MB-sized area in its memory map where the first 128MB of
   its memory is mirrored.  Linux knows about it and just ignores
   that memory, and thus this message.<p>

  <sect2>Silicon Graphics Origin&nbsp;200 and 2000<p>
  <htmlurl url="mailto:ralf@gnu.org" name="Ralf B&auml;chle (ralf@gnu.org)">
  and a team of SGI employees are currently working on a port to the
  Origin&nbsp;200.  While still in it's early stages, it's running in
  uniprocessor and multiprocessor mode and has drivers for the built-in
  IOC3 Ethernet and SCSI hostadapters.  The code is available in the
  Linux/MIPS CVS tree.<p>

  <sect2>Silicon Graphics Onyx&nbsp;2<p>
  The Onyx&nbsp;2 is basically an Origin&nbsp;2000 with additional graphics
  hardware.  As of now, writing Linux support for the graphics hardware has
  not yet been done.  Aside from that, Linux should run just as well as
  on a normal, headless Origin&nbsp;2000 configuration.<p>

  <sect2>Silicon Graphics Power Series<p>
  This is a very old series of R3000 SMP systems.  There is no hardware
  documentation for these machines, few of them even exist anymore, and the
  hardware is weird.  In short, the chances that Linux will ever run on them
  are approximating zero.  Not that we want to discourage any takers&nbsp;...

  <sect2>Serial console on SGI machines<p>
  Make sure that the kernel you're using includes the appropriate driver for a
  serial interface and serial console.  Set the <em>console</em>
  ARC environment variable to either the value <em>d1</em>, or <em>d2</em>
  for Indy and Challenge&nbsp;S depending on which serial interface you're
  going to use as the console.<p>

  If you have the problem that all kernel messages appear on the serial
  console on boot-up, but everything is missing from the point when init starts,
  then you probably have the wrong setup for your /dev/console.
  You can find more information about this in the Linux kernel source
  documentation which is in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/serial-console.txt if
  you have the kernel source installed.

  <sect2>Other Silicon Graphics machines<p>
  At this time, no other Silicon Graphics machine is supported.  This also
  applies to the <sl>very</sl> old Motorola 68k-based systems.

  <sect2>Sony Playstation<p>
  The Sony Playstation is based on an R3000 derivative and uses a set of
  graphics chips developed by Sony themselves.  While the machine, in theory,
  is capable of running Linux, a port is difficult since Sony so far
  hasn't provided the necessary technical information.  This still leaves the
  question of whether the port would be worthwhile.  So in short, nothing has
  happened yet even though many people have shown an interest in running Linux
  on this system.

  <sect2>SNI RM200C<p>
  In contrast to the RM200 (see below), this machine has EISA and PCI slots.
  The RM200 is supported with the exception of the availability of the onboard
  NCR53c810A SCSI controller.

  <sect2>SNI RM200<p>
  If your machine has both EISA and PCI slots, then it is an RM200C (please
  see above).  Due to the slight architectural differences of the RM200 and
  the RM200C, this machine isn't currently supported in the official sources.
  <htmlurl url="mailto:engel@numerik.math.uni-siegen.de"
  name="Michael Engel (engel@numerik.math.uni-siegen.de)"> has managed to get
  his RM200 working partially, but the patches haven't yet been included in the
  official Linux/MIPS sources.

  <sect2>SNI RM300C<p>
  The RM300 is technically very similar to the RM200C.  It should be supported
  by the current Linux kernel, but we haven't yet received any reports.

  <sect2>SNI RM400<p>
  The RM400 isn't supported.

  <sect2>SNI RW320<p>
  This machine is a OEM variant of the SGI Indigo and therefore also unsupported.

  <sect2>Algorithmics P4032<p>
  The Algorithmics P4032 port is, at the time of this writing, still running
  Linux 2.1.36.

  <sect2>Algorithmics P5064<p>
  The P5064 is basically an R5000-based 64bit variant of the P4032.  A port is
  ongoing.

  <sect2>DECstation series<p>
  During the late 80's and the early 90's, Digital (now Compaq) built MIPS-based 
  Workstations named DECstation resp. DECsystem. Other x86 and Alpha-based
  machines were sold under the name DECstation, but these are obviously not the 
  subject of this FAQ. Support for DECstations is still under development,
  started by Paul M. Antoine. These days, most of the work is done by  
  <htmlurl url="mailto:Harald.Koerfgen@home.ivm.de" 
  name="Harald Koerfgen (Harald.Koerfgen@home.ivm.de)"> and others. On the 
  Internet, DECstation-related information can be found at
  <url url="http://decstation.unix-ag.org/">. 

  The DECstation family ranges from the DECstation 2100 with an R2000/R2010 
  chipset at 12 MHz, to the DECstation 5000/260 with a 60 MHz R4400SC.
   
  The following DECstation models are actively supported: 
  <itemize>
    <item>2100, codename PMAX
    <item>5000/xx (Personal&nbsp;DECstation), codename MAXine
    <item>5000/1xx, codename 3MIN
    <item>5000/200, codename 3MAX
    <item>5000/2x0, codename 3MAX+
    <item>5900/2x0 (identical to the 3MAX+). 
  </itemize> 
 
  These DECstation models are orphaned because nobody is working on them,  
  but support for them should be relatively easy to achieve. 
  <itemize> 
    <item>3100, identical to the 2100 except the R2000A/R2010A @ 16 MHz 
    <item>5100, codename MIPSMATE, almost identical to the 2100 but with an
          R3000/R3010 chipset.
  </itemize>

  The other members of the DECstation family, besides the x86 based ones, 
  should be considered as VAXen with the CPU replaced by a MIPS CPU. 
  There is absolutely no information available about these machines and support
  for them is unlikely to ever happen unless the VAXLinux port comes back to 
  life. These are:
   <itemize> 
     <item>5400, codename MIPSFAIR
     <item>5500, codename MIPSFAIR2
     <item>5800, codename ISIS
   </itemize> 

  <sect2>Mips Magnum 4000 / Olivetti M700-10<p>
  These two machines are almost completely identical.  Back during the
  ACE initiative, Olivetti licensed the Jazz design and marketed the machine
  with Windows&nbsp;NT as the OS.  MIPS Computer Systems, Inc. bought the
  Jazz design and marketed it as the MIPS Magnum 4000 series of machines.
  Magnum 4000 systems were marketed with Windows&nbsp;NT and RISC/os as the
  operating systems.<p>

  The firmware on the machine depended on the operating system which was
  installed.  Linux/MIPS supports only
  the little endian firmware on these two types of machines.  Since the
  M700-10 was only marketed as an NT machine, all M700-10 machines have this
  firmware installed.  The MIPS Magnum case is somewhat more complex.  If
  your machine has been configured big endian for RISC/os, then you need
  to reload the little endian firmware.  This firmware was originally
  included on a floppy with the delivery of every Magnum.  If you don't
  have the floppy anymore you can download it via anonymous ftp from
  <url url="ftp://ftp.fnet.fr">.<p>

  It is possible to reconfigure the M700 for headless operation by setting
  the firmware environment variables ConsoleIn and ConsoleOut to
  multi()serial(0)term().  Also, try the command <sl>listdev</sl> which will
  show the available ARC devices.

  In some cases, like where the G364 graphics card is missing but the console
  is still configured to use normal graphics, it will be necessary to set
  the configuration jumper JP2 on the board.  After the next reset, the machine
  will reboot with the console on COM2.

  <sect2>MIPS Magnum 4000SC<p>
  The MIPS Magnum 4000SC is the same as a Magnum 4000 (see above) with
  the exception that it uses an R4000SC CPU.

 <sect1>Processor types
 <label id="supported-cpus">
  <sect2>R2000, R3000 family<p>
   The R2000 is the original MIPS processor.  It's a 32 bit processor which
   was clocked at 8MHz back in '85 when the first MIPS processors came to the
   market.  Later versions were clocked faster, for example,
   the R3000 is a 100% compatible redesign of the R2000 which is just clocked
   faster.  Because of their high compatibility, where this document mentions
   the R3000, in most cases the same facts also apply to the R2000.
   The R3000A is basically an R2000, plus an R3010 FPU,
   and 64K cache running at up to 40MHz all integrated onto the same chip.<p>

   <htmlurl url="mailto:Harald.Koerfgen@home.ivm.de"
   name="Harald Koerfgen (Harald.Koerfgen@home.ivm.de)"> and <htmlurl
   url="mailto:raiko@niisi.msk.ru" name="Gleb O. Raiko (raiko@niisi.msk.ru)">
   have both independently worked on patches for R3000 processors.
   The work has been merged and integrated into the official Linux/MIPS
   sources since July 1999. Actually, Linux supports R3000 processors including
   some derivatives like the R3081 and the TMPR3912/PR31700<p>

  <sect2>R6000<p>
   Sometimes people confuse the R6000, a MIPS processor, with RS6000, a series
   of workstations made by IBM.  So, if you're reading this in hope of finding
   out more about Linux on IBM machines, then you're reading the wrong document.<p>

   The R6000 is currently not supported.  It is a 32-bit MIPS ISA 2 processor;
   a pretty interesting and weird piece of silicon.  It was developed
   and produced by a company named <sl>BIT Technology</sl>.  Later, NEC took
   over the semiconductor production.  It was built using ECL technology, the
   same technology that was, and still is, being used to build extremely fast
   chips like those used in some Cray computers.  The processor had its
   TLB implemented as part of the last couple of lines of the external
   primary cache, a technology called <sl>TLB slice</sl>.  That means its
   MMU is substantially different from those of the R3000 or R4000 series,
   which is also one of the reasons why the processor isn't supported.

  <sect2>R4000 and R5000 family<p>
  Linux supports many of the members of the R4000 family.  Currently, these
  are: R4000PC, R4400PC, R4300, R4600, R4700, R5000, R5230, R5260.  Many
  others are probably supported as well.<p>

  Not supported are the R4000MC and R4400MC CPUs (that is multiprocessor
  systems), as well as R5000 systems with a CPU-controlled second level cache.
  This means that the cache is controlled by the R5000 itself, in contrast to
  some external cache controller.  The difference is important because,
  unlike other systems, especially PCs, on MIPS the cache is architecturally
  visible and needs to be controlled by software.<p>
  Special credit goes to <htmlurl url="mailto:grim@zigzegv.ml.org"
  name="Ulf Carlsson (ulfc@engr.sgi.com)"> who provided the CPU module for
  debugging the R4000SC / R4400SC support.

  <sect2>R8000<p>
   The R8000 is currently unsupported partly because this processor is
   relatively rare and has only been used in a few SGI machines, and partly because
   the Linux/MIPS developers don't have such a machine.<p>
   The R8000 is a pretty interesting piece of silicon.  Unlike the other
   members of the MIPS family it is a set of seven chips.  It's cache and TLB
   architecture are pretty different from the other members of the MIPS family.
   It was born as a quick hack to get the floating point crown back to
   Silicon&nbsp;Graphics before the R10000 is finished.

  <sect2>R10000<p>
   The R10000 is supported as part of the mips64 kernel which currently is
   supported on the IP22 (SGI Indy, Challenge&nbsp;S and Indigo&nbsp;2) and
   Origin.<p>
   Due to the very hard-to-handle way this processor works in non-cachecoherent
   systems, it will probably be some time until we support this processor
   in such systems.  As of today, these systems are the SGI&nbsp;O2 and
   Indigo&nbsp;<p>

  <sect2>Processors without TLB<p>
   For embedded purposes, there are special derivates of the above CPU available
   which often lack a full TLB.  We don't support those types nor should you
   ever expect such support to be added.<p>

   Hackers may want to take a look at a Linux subset named Microcontroller
   Linux, or short, ucLinux.  This would be supportable on TLB-less processors.
   Given the litte difference between CPU types with and without TLB, we
   still recommend that you choose a processor with TLB.  It's going to save you
   a lot of engineering.

  <sect2>Processors with partial or no FPU<p>
   In theory, these processors are supportable, especially when applications
   don't rely on the presence of a FPU.  We, however, don't support that yet.

 <sect1>Hardware we're never going to support<p>
  <sect2>IBM RS6000<p>
  As the name says, these are IBM machines which are based on the RS6000
  processor series, and, as such, they're not the subject of the Linux/MIPS project.
  People frequently confuse the IBM RS6000 with the MIPS R6000 architecture.
  However, the Linux/PPC project might support these machines.  Checkout
  <url url="http://www.linuxppc.org/"> for further information.

  <sect2>VaxStation<p>
  As the name already implies, this machine is a member of Digital Equipment's
  VAX family.  It's mentioned here because people often confuse it with
  Digital's MIPS-based DECstation family due to the similar type numbers. These
  two families of architectures share little technical similarities.
  Unfortunately, the VaxStation, like the entire VAX family, is currently
  unsupported.

  <sect2>SGI VisPC<p>
  This is actually an x86-based system, therefore not covered by this FAQ.  
  There is some limited Linux support available for the older Visual
  Workstations.  The current series of Visual Workstations is an officially
  supported SGI product. Please see <url url="http://oss.sgi.com"> and
  <url url="http://www.sgi.com"> for more information.

  <sect2>Motorola 68k-based machines like the Iris&nbsp;3000<p>
  These are <sl>very</sl> old machines, probably more than ten years old by
  now.  As these machines are not based on MIPS processors, and therefore not
  supported by the Linux/MIPS project, this document is the wrong place to
  search for information.

<sect>Linux distributions.<p>
 <sect1>RedHat<p>
  For MIPSeb, there's Rough Cuts Linux, previously known as Hard Hat Linux,
  which is most of RedHat Linux 5.1 ported for MIPSeb.  You can get this at
  <url url="ftp://oss.sgi.com/pub/hardhat">.

  It is also bundled along with M68k, UltraSparc, and PowerPC in a package
  called "Rough Cuts" pressed by RedHat, and available wherever RedHat
  products are sold.  This is a very convenient way to get it without having
  to download 280MB.  You can order Rough Cuts directly from RedHat at
  <url url="http://www.redhat.com/product.phtml/RC1000">.

  Also, there's a distribution based on Red Hat 5.2 that's targeting the
  Cobalt Qubes. Those binaries will work perfectly on other MIPSel
  architectures available at
  <url url="ftp://intel.cleveland.lug.net/pub/Mipsel">.
  <url url="ftp://bolug.uni-bonn.de/mips"> has various rpm packages from
  Redhat&nbsp;6.0 and 6.1.

 <sect1>Debian<p>
  A Debian port is underway.  Current efforts are being bootstrapped using
  SGI/Linux as a base, and dpkg compiles natively with few changes.  In
  addition to the SGI version, some interest has been shown in little endian
  platforms.  Keep an eye on the Debian-MIPS Port page,
  <url url="http://www.debian.org/ports/mips/"> for developments.

 <sect1>Simple<p>
  This distribution is for big-endian systems only so far. It's highly
  experimental, intended for developers' use in testing the latest versions
  of gcc, binutils, glibc, and the kernel. This is the only glibc 2.2-based
  distribution available for MIPS. You can always get the latest version of
  this distribution and accompanying release notes at <url 
  url="ftp://oss.sgi.com/pub/linux/mips/mips-linux/simple">. Also available 
  is a cross-compiler system to aid in development.

<sect>Linux/MIPS net resources.<p>
 <sect1>Anonymous FTP servers.<p>
 The two primary anonymous FTP servers for Linux/MIPS are
 <descrip>
  <tag><htmlurl url="ftp://oss.sgi.com" name="oss.sgi.com"><p>
    This server should satisfy almost all of your Linux/MIPS related ftp desires.
    Really.<p>
  <tag><htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.fnet.fr" name="ftp.fnet.fr"><p>
    This server is currently pretty outdated. It's included here mostly for
    completeness, and for people with interest in prehistoric software.
 </descrip>
 On all of these ftp servers, there is a list of mirror sites you may
 want to use for faster access.<p>

 Another source for little endian MIPS binaries is
 <htmlurl url="ftp://intel.cleveland.lug.net/pub/Mipsel"
 name="ftp://intel.cleveland.lug.net/pub/Mipsel">, which carries mostly newer
 versions of binaries for the RedHat flavour shipping with the Cobalts.<p>

 <sect1>Anonymous CVS servers.<p>
 For those who always want to stay on the bleeding edge, and want to avoid
 having to download patch files or full tarballs, we also have an anonymous
 CVS server.  Using CVS, you can checkout the Linux/MIPS source tree with
 the following commands:<p>

 <verb>
   cvs -d :pserver:cvs@oss.sgi.com:/cvs login
   (Only needed the first time you use anonymous CVS, the password is "cvs")
   cvs -d :pserver:cvs@oss.sgi.com:/cvs co <repository>
 </verb>
 where you insert linux, libc, gdb or faq for &lt;repository>.

 The other important CVS archive of the Linux community is vger.kernel.org,
 where a lot of code is being collected before being sent to Linus for
 distribution.  Although vger itself no longer offers anonymous access, there
 are mirror sites which do provide anonymous access.  For details on how to access
 them, see <url url="http://cvs.on.openprojects.net/">.  The modules which are
 of interest are: ``linux'', ``modutils'', ``pciutils'', and ``netutils''.

  <sect1>Web servers.<p>
 The two primary web servers for Linux/MIPS are
 <descrip>
  <tag><url url="http://oss.sgi.com/mips"><p>
    This server covers most of Linux/MIPS. It's somewhat SGI-centric, but since
    Linux/MIPS tries to be the same on every platform, most of its information
    is of interest to all users.
  <tag><url url="http://www.linux-mips.org"><p>
    Quite new site which one day will hopefully become the main Linux/MIPS
    site.
  <tag><url url="http://lena.fnet.fr"><p>
    This server is currently pretty outdated. It's included here mostly for
    completeness.
 </descrip>
 All of these servers have mirrors scattered all over the world - you may want to
 use one for best performance.

 <sect1>Web CVS server.<p>
  Via <url url="http://oss.sgi.com/mips/cvsweb">, you have
  direct access to the new Linux/MIPS kernel sources, and a few other projects
  hosted in the same CVS archive.  The intuitive interface allows you to
  follow the development at the click of your mouse.

 <sect1>Mailing lists.<p>
 There are three Linux/MIPS-oriented mailing lists:
 <descrip>
  <tag><htmlurl url="mailto:linux-mips@fnet.fr" name="linux-mips@fnet.fr"><p>
   This mailing list is used for most all non-SGI related communication.
   Subscription is handled by a human, and you can send your subscription requests

   list by sending <em>unsubscribe &lt;your-email-address&gt;</em> to the same
   address.

  <tag><htmlurl url="mailto:linux-mips@oss.sgi.com"
   name="linux-mips@oss.sgi.com"><p> This mailing list currently has the most
   traffic.  It's somewhat SGI-centric but is nevertheless of interest
   especially to developers as a good number of SGI engineers are subscribed
   to this list.  Subscription to this list is handled via

  </descrip>

 <sect1>IRC channel.<p>
  There is an IRC channel named #mipslinux for Linux/MIPS which may be found on 
  irc.openprojects.net.

<sect>Installation of Linux/MIPS and common problems.<p>

 <sect1>NFS booting fails.<p>
  Usually, the reason for this is that people have unpacked the tar archive
  under IRIX, not Linux.  Since the representation of device files over
  NFS is not standardized between various Unices, this fails.  The symptom
  is that the system dies with the error message ``Warning: unable to open
  an initial console.'' right after mounting the NFS filesystem.<p>

  For now, the workaround is to use a Linux system (doesn't need to be MIPS)
  to unpack the installation archive onto the NFS server.  The NFS server
  itself may be any type of UNIX.<p>
  
 <sect1>Self-compiled kernels crash when booting.<p>
  When I build my own kernel, it crashes.  On an Indy the crash message
  looks like the following (the same problem hits other machines as well
  but may look completely different):

  <verb>
   Exception: <vector=UTLB Miss>

   PANIC: Unexpected exception
  </verb>

 This problem is caused by a still unfixed bug in Binutils newer than
 version 2.7.  As a workaround, change the following line in arch/mips/Makefile
 from:

 <verb>
   LINKFLAGS       = -static -N
 </verb>

 to:

 <verb>
   LINKFLAGS       = -static
 </verb>

 <sect1>Booting the kernel on the Indy fails with PROM error messages<p>
  <verb>
   >> boot bootp()/vmlinux
   73264+592+11520+331680+27848d+3628+5792 entry: 0x8df9a960

   Obtaining /vmlinux from server deadmoon

   Cannot load bootp()/vmlinux
   Illegal f_magic number 0x7f45, expected MIPSELMAGIC or MIPSEBMAGIC.
  </verb>

 This problem only happens for Indys with very old PROM versions which cannot
 handle the ELF binary format which Linux uses.  A solution for this problem
 is in the works.

 <sect1>Where can I get the little endian firmware for my SNI?<p>

  SNI's system can be operated in both big and little endian modes.  At this
  time, Linux/MIPS only supports the little endian firmware.  This is somewhat
  unlucky since SNI hasn't shipped that firmware for quite some time, since
  they dropped Windows&nbsp;NT.

  When running in big endian mode, the firmware looks
  similar to an SGI Indy which is already supported, therefore fixing the
  SNI support will be relatively easy.  Interested hackers should contact
  <htmlurl url="mailto:ralf@gnu.org" name="Ralf B&auml;chle (ralf@gnu.org)">.

 <sect1>ld dies with signal 6<p>
 <verb>
   collect2: ld terminated with signal 6 [Aborted]
 </verb>
 This is a known bug in older binutils versions.  You will have to upgrade to
 binutils 2.8.1 plus very current patches.

 <sect1>My machine doesn't download the kernel when I try to netboot<p>
 
  Your machine is replying to the BOOTP packets (you may verify this
  using a packet sniffer like tcpdump or ethereal), but doesn't download the
  kernel from your BOOTP server. This happens if your boot server is 
  running a kernel of the 2.3 series or higher. The problem may be circumvented
  by doing a "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_no_pmtu_disc" as root on your
  boot server.

 <sect1>Bug in DHCP version 2<p>
  When using DHCP version 2 you might see the following problem:
  Your machines receives it's BOOTP reply 3 times but refuses to start TFTP.
  You can fix this by doing a "unsetenv netaddr" in the PROM command monitor before you boot your
  system. DHCP version 3 fixes that problem.

<sect>Milo<p>
 Milo is the boot loader used to boot the little endian MIPS systems with
 ARC firmware, currently the Jazz family and the SNI RM&nbsp;200.
 While Milo uses the same name and has a similar purpose to the Alpha version
 of Milo, these two Milos have nothing else in common.  They were developed
 by different people, don't share any code, and work on different hardware
 platforms.  The fact that both have the same name is just a kind of
 historic ``accident''.<p>
 Plans are to remove the need for Milo in the near future.<p>

 <sect1>Building Milo<p>
  The building procedure of Milo is described, in detail, in the README files
  in the Milo package.  Since Milo has some dependencies to kernel header
  files which have changed over time, Milo often cannot be built easily.
  However, the Milo distribution includes binaries for both Milo and Pandora.

 <sect1>Pandora<p>
  Pandora is a simple debugger which was primarily developed in order
  to analyze undocumented systems.  Pandora includes a disassembler,
  memory dump functions, and more.  If you only want to use Linux, then there is
  no need to install Pandora, despite its small size.

<sect>Loadable Modules<p>
 Using modules on Linux/MIPS is quite easy. It should work as expected for people who have used
 the feature on other Linux systems.  If you want to run a module-based system, then
 you should have at least kernel version 980919, and modutils newer than
 version 2.1.121 installed.  Older versions won't work.

<sect>How do I set up a cross-compiler?<p>
 <sect1>Available binaries<p>
 The easiest way to setup a cross-compiler is to just download the binaries.
 For Linux/i386 hosts and big endian targets, these are the packages:
 <verb>
  binutils-mips-linux-2.8.1-1.i386.rpm
  egcs-c++-mips-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
  egcs-g77-mips-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
  egcs-libstdc++-mips-linux-2.9.0-2.i386.rpm
  egcs-mips-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
  egcs-objc-mips-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
 </verb>

 And this is the list of packages for little endian targets:
 <verb>
  binutils-mipsel-linux-2.8.1-1.i386.rpm
  egcs-c++-mipsel-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
  egcs-g77-mipsel-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
  egcs-libstdc++-mipsel-linux-2.9.0-2.i386.rpm
  egcs-mipsel-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
  egcs-objc-mipsel-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
 </verb>

 For 64-bit MIPS kernels, there is only one package available right
 now:
 <verb>
  egcs-mips64-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
 </verb>

 This compiler is only available in the big endian flavor as there currently
 is no little endian machine supported by the 64-bit kernel.  A little endian
 version of the compiler will be provided as soon as there is demand for one.

 It's not necessary that you install all of these packages as most people can
 just omit the C++, Objective&nbsp;C and Fortran&nbsp;77 compilers.  The
 Intel binaries have been linked against GNU libc 2.1, so you may have
 to install that as well when upgrading.

 <sect1>Recommended compiler versions<p>
  Compilers older than egcs 1.1.2 are no longer supported for compiling kernels
  due to bugs in the generated code.  At this time, we still recommend
  binutils 2.8.1 despite their age.

 <sect1>Building your own cross-compiler<p>
  First of all, go and download the following source packages:
  <itemize>
   <item>binutils-2.8.1.tar.gz
   <item>egcs-1.1.2.tar.gz
   <item>glibc-2.0.6.tar.gz
   <item>glibc-crypt-2.0.6.tar.gz
   <item>glibc-localedata-2.0.6.tar.gz
   <item>glibc-linuxthreads-2.0.6.tar.gz
  </itemize>
  You can obtain these files from your favorite GNU archive or
  <htmlurl url="ftp://oss.sgi.com" name="oss.sgi.com">.  Furthermore, you'll
  need patches.  The unbundled patch files aren't always up-to-date and addional,
  not MIPS-specific, patches may be required for building.  Note that the
  unbundled patch files also use a different revision numbering and it is
  therefore recommended that you obtain the source and patches from the RPM packages
  distributed on <htmlurl url="ftp://oss.sgi.com" name="oss.sgi.com">.

  Those are the currently recommended versions.  Older versions may or may not
  be working.  If you're trying to use older versions, please don't send
  bug reports because we don't care.  When installing, please install things in the
  order of binutils, egcs, then glibc.  Unless you have older versions
  already installed, changing the order <sl>will</sl> fail.

 <sect1>Disk space requirements<p>
  For the installation, you'll have to choose a directory where the files will be
  installed. I'll refer to that directory below with &lt;prefix>.  To avoid a particular
  problem, it's best to use the same value for &lt;prefix> as your native gcc.
  For example, if your gcc is installed in /usr/bin/gcc, then choose /usr for
  &lt;prefix>.  You must use the same &lt;prefix> value for all the packages
  that you're going to install.<p>
  During compilation, you'll need about 31MB disk space for binutils. For
  installation, you'll need 7MB disk space on &lt;prefix>'s
  partition.  Building egcs requires 71MB, and installation 14MB.  GNU libc
  requires 149MB disk space during compilation, and 33MB for installation.
  Note, these numbers are just a guideline and may differ significantly for
  different processor and operating system architectures or compiler options.

 <sect1>Byte order<p>
  One of the special features of the MIPS architecture is that all processors
  except the R8000 can be configured to run either in big or in little endian
  mode.  Byte order means the way the processor stores multibyte numbers in
  memory.  Big endian machines store the byte with the highest value digits
  at the lowest address while little endian machines store it at the highest
  address.  Think of it as writing multi-digit numbers from left to
  right or vice versa.<p>
  In order to setup your cross-compiler correctly, you have to know the byte
  order of the cross-compiler target.  If you don't already know, check
  the section <ref id="hardware-platforms" name="Hardware Platforms"> for your
  machine's byte order.

 <sect1>Configuration names<p>
  Many of the packages based on autoconf support many different
  architectures and operating systems.  In order to differentiate between
  these many configurations, names are constructed with
  &lt;cpu>-&lt;company>-&lt;os>, or even
  &lt;cpu>-&lt;company>-&lt;kernel>-&lt;os>.  Expressed this way,
  the configuration names of Linux/MIPS are: mips-unknown-linux-gnu for big
  endian targets, or mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu for little endian targets.  These
  names are a bit long and are allowed to be abbreviated to mips-linux or
  mipsel-linux.  You <sl>must</sl> use the same configuration name for all
  packages that comprise your cross-compilation environment.  Also, while
  other names, like mips-sni-linux or mipsel-sni-linux, are legal configuration
  names, use mips-linux or mipsel-linux instead. These are the configuration
  names known to other packages, like the Linux kernel sources, and they would
  otherwise have to be changed for cross-compilation.<p>
  I'll refer to the target configuration name below with &lt;target>.

 <sect1>Installation of GNU Binutils.<p>
  This is the first and simplest part (at least as long as you're trying to
  install on any halfway-sane UNIX flavour).  Just cd into a directory with
  enough free space and do the following:
  <verb>
   gzip -cd binutils-<version>.tar.gz | tar xf -
   cd binutils-<version>
   patch -p1 < ../binutils-<version>-mips.patch
   ./configure --prefix=<prefix> --target=<target>
   make CFLAGS=-O2
   make install
  </verb>
  This usually works correctly.  However, certain machines using GCC 2.7.x as
  compiler are known to dump core.  This is a known bug in GCC and can be fixed
  by upgrading the host compiler to GCC 2.8.1 or better.

 <sect1>Assert.h<p>
 Some people have an old assert.h header file installed, probably leftover
 from an old cross-compiler installation.  This file may cause autoconf
 scripts to fail silently. Assert.h was never necessary and was only installed
 because of a bug in older GCC versions.  Check to see if the file
 &lt;prefix>/&lt;target>/include/assert.h exists in your installation.  If
 so, just delete the it - it should never have been installed for any version
 of the cross-compiler and will cause trouble.

 <sect1>Installing the kernel sources<p>
 Installing the kernel sources is simple.  Just place them into some directory
 of your choice and configure them.  Configuring them is necessary so that
 files which are generated by the procedure will be installed.  Make sure
 you enable CONFIG_CROSSCOMPILE near the end of the configuration process.
 The only problem you may run into is that you may need to install some
 required GNU programs like bash or have to override the manufacturer-provided
 versions of programs by placing the GNU versions earlier in the PATH variable.
 Now, go to the directory &lt;prefix>/&lt;target>/include and create two
 symbolic links named asm and linux pointing to include/asm rsp. include/linux
 within your just installed and configured kernel sources.  These are
 necessary such that the necessary header files will be found during the next
 step.

 <sect1>First installation of egcs<p>
 Now the pain begins.  There is a so-called bootstrap problem.
 In our case, this means that the installation process of egcs needs an already
 installed glibc, but we cannot compile glibc because we don't have a
 working cross-compiler yet.  Luckily, you'll only have to go through this
 once when you install a cross-compiler for the first time.  Later, when you
 already have glibc installed, things will be much smoother.  So now do:
 <verb>
   gzip -cd egcs-1.1.2.tar.gz | tar xf -
   cd egcs-<version>
   patch -p1 < ../egcs-1.1.2-mips.patch
   ./configure --prefix=<prefix> --with-newlib --target=<target>
   make SUBDIRS="libiberty texinfo gcc" ALL_TARGET_MODULES= \
           CONFIGURE_TARGET_MODULES= INSTALL_TARGET_MODULES= LANGUAGES="c"
 </verb>
 Note that we deliberately don't build gcov, protoize, unprotoize, and the
 libraries.  Gcov doesn't make sense in a cross-compiler environment, and
 protoize and unprotoize might even overwrite your native programs - this
 is a bug in the gcc makefiles.  Finally, we cannot build the libraries
 because we don't have glibc installed yet.  If everything went successfully,
 install with:
 <verb>
   make SUBDIRS="libiberty texinfo gcc" INSTALL_TARGET_MODULES= \
           LANGUAGES="c" install
 </verb>

 If you only want the cross-compiler for building the kernel, you're done.
 Cross-compiling libc is only required to be able to compile user applications.

 <sect1>Test what you've done so far<p>
 Just to make sure that what you've done so far is actually working, you
 may now try to compile the kernel.  Cd to the MIPS kernel's sources and
 type ``make clean; make dep; make''.  If everything went ok do ``make clean''
 once more to clean the sources.

 <sect1>Installing GNU libc<p>
 <sl>Note: Building glibc 2.0.6 using a compiler newer than egcs 1.0.3a is not
 recommended due to binary compatibility problems which may hit certain
 software.  It's recommended that you either use egcs 1.0.3a or use the files
 from a published binary package.  Crosscompiling GNU libc is always only the
 second best solution as certain parts of it will not be compiled when
 crosscompiling.  A proper solution will be documented here as soon as it is
 available and believed to be stable.</sl>  With this warning given, here's the
 recipe:
 <verb>
   gzip -cd glibc-2.0.6.tar.gz | tar xf -
   cd glibc-2.0.6
   gzip -cd glibc-crypt-2.0.6.tar.gz | tar xf -
   gzip -cd glibc-localedata-2.0.6.tar.gz | tar xf -
   gzip -cd glibc-linuxthreads-2.0.6.tar.gz | tar xf -
   patch -p1 < ../glibc-2.0.6-mips.patch
   mkdir build
   cd build
   CC=<target>-gcc BUILD_CC=gcc AR=<target>-ar RANLIB=<target>-ranlib \
         ../configure --prefix=/usr --host=<target> \
         --enable-add-ons=crypt,linuxthreads,localedata --enable-profile
   make
 </verb>
 You now have a compiled GNU libc which still needs to be installed.  Do
 <sl>not</sl> just type make install.  That would overwrite your host
 system's files with Linux/MIPS-specific files with disastrous effects.
 Instead, install GNU libc into some other arbitrary directory &lt;somedir>
 from which we'll move the parts we need for cross-compilation into the
 actual target directory:
 <verb>
   make install_root=<somedir> install
 </verb>
 Now cd into &lt;somedir> and finally install GNU libc manually:
 <verb>
   cd usr/include
   find . -print | cpio -pumd <prefix>/<target>/include
   cd ../../lib
   find . -print | cpio -pumd <prefix>/<target>/lib
   cd ../usr/lib
   find . -print | cpio -pumd <prefix>/<target>/lib
 </verb>
 GNU libc also contains extensive online documentation.  Your system might
 already have a version of this documentation installed, so if you don't
 want to install the info pages, which will save you a less than a megabyte,
 or already have them installed, skip the next step:
 <verb>
   cd ../info
   gzip -9 *.info*
   find . -name \*.info\* -print | cpio -pumd <prefix>/info
 </verb>
 If you're not bootstrapping, your installation is now finished.

 <sect1>Building egcs again<p>
 The first attempt of building egcs was stopped by lack of a GNU
 libc.  Since we now have libc installed we can rebuild egcs but this
 time as complete as a cross-compiler installation can be:
 <verb>
   gzip -cd egcs-<version>.tar.gz | tar xf -
   cd egcs-<version>
   patch -p1 < ../egcs-1.1.2-mips.patch
   ./configure --prefix=<prefix> --target=<target>
   make LANGUAGES="c c++ objective-c f77"
 </verb>
 As you can see, the procedure is the same as the first time, with the
 exception that we dropped the --with-newlib option.  This option was
 necessary to avoid the libgcc build breaking due to the lack of
 libc.  Now install with:
 <verb>
   make LANGUAGES="c c++ objective-c f77" install
 </verb>
 You're almost finished.  If you think you don't need the Objective&nbsp;C or
 F77 compilers, you can omit them from above commands. Each will save you about
 3MB.  Do not build gcov, protoize, or unprotoize.

 <sect1>Should I build the C++, Objective&nbsp;C or F77 compilers?<p>
 The answer to this question largely depends on your use of your cross-compiler
 environment.  If you only intend to rebuild the Linux kernel, then you have
 no need for the full blown setup and can safely omit the Objective&nbsp;C and
 F77 compilers.  You must, however, build the C++ compiler, because building
 the libraries included with the egcs distribution requires C++.

 <sect1>How about float.h?<p>
 The installation of float.h is no longer necessary. Since about egcs 1.0.3a,
 a proper float.h header file will automatically be generated and installed.

 <sect1>Known problem when cross-compiling<p>
  <sect2>IRIX crashes<p>
  Origin&nbsp;200 running IRIX 6.5.1 may crash when running ``make depend''
  on the Linux kernel sources.  IRIX&nbsp;6.5 on Indy and IRIX&nbsp;6.5.4 on
  Origin&nbsp;200 are known to work.  Further reports that help to isolate
  the problematic configuration are welcome.

  <sect2>Resource limits on System&nbsp;V based hosts<p>
  Typical System&nbsp;V-based Unices, like IRIX or Solaris, have limits for
  the maximum number of arguments to be passed to a child process which
  may be exceeded when cross-compiling some software like the Linux kernel
  or GNU libc.  For IRIX systems, the maximum length of the argument list
  defaults to 20KB, while Linux defaults to at least 128KB.  This size
  can be modified by the command ``systune ncargs 131072'' as root.

 <sect1>GDB<p>
 Building GDB as cross-debugger is only of interest to kernel developers. For
 them, GDB may be a life saver.  Such a remote debugging setup always
 consists of two parts:  the remote debugger GDB running on one machine, and
 the target machine running the Linux/MIPS kernel being debugged.  The machines
 are typically interconnected with a serial line.  The target machine's kernel
 needs to be equipped with a ``debugging stub'' which communicates with the
 GDB host machine using the remote serial protocol.<p>

 Depending on the target's architecture, you may have to implement the
 debugging stub yourself.  In general, you'll only have to write very simple
 routines for the serial line.  The task is further simplified by the fact that most
 machines are using similar serial hardware, typically based on the 8250,
 16450 or derivatives.<p>

  Author Dominic Sweetman, Publisher Morgan Kaufmann, ISBN 1-55860-410-3.

  This is intended as a pretty comprehensive guide to programming MIPS,
  wherever it's different from programming any other 32-bit CPU.  It's the
  first time anyone has tried to write a readable, and comprehensive, explanation
  and account of the wide range of MIPS CPUs available. It should be very
  helpful for anyone programming MIPS who isn't insulated by someone else's
  operating system.  Also, the author is a free-unix enthusiast who subscribes
  to the Linux/MIPS mailing list!

  John Hennessey, father of the MIPS architecture, was kind enough to write
  in the foreword: ``... this book is the best combination of completeness
  and readability of any book on the MIPS architecture ...'';

  It includes some context about RISC CPUs, a description of the
  architecture and instruction set, including the "co-processor 0"
  instructions used for CPU control; sections on caches, exceptions, memory
  management, and floating point.  There's a detailed assembly language
  guide, some stuff about porting, and some fairly heavy-duty software
  examples.

  I'd be inclined to list two other books too, both from Morgan Kaufmann and
  available from www.mkp.com or any good bookshop:

  <sect1>The MIPS Programmer's Handbook<p>
  Authors Farquhar and Bunce, Publisher Morgan Kaufmann,
  ISBN&nbsp;1-55860-297-6.

  A readable introduction to the practice of programming MIPS at the low
  level, by the author of PMON.  Strengths: lots of examples; weakness:
  leaves out some big pieces of the architecture (such as memory management,
  floating point and advanced caches) because they didn't feature in the LSI
  ``embedded'' products this book was meant to partner.

  <sect1>Computer Architecture - A Quantitative Approach<p>
  Authors Hennessy & Patterson, Publisher Morgan Kaufmann,
  ISBN&nbsp;1-55860-329-8.

  The bible of modern computer architecture and a must-read if you want
  to understand what makes programs run slow or fast.  Is it about MIPS?
  Well, it's mostly about something very <em>like</em> MIPS...  Its sole
  defect is its size and weight - but unlike most big books it's worth
  every page.

  <sect1>UNIX System&nbsp;V ABI MIPS Processor Supplement<p>
  By Prentice Hall, Published 05/1991, ISBN&nbsp;0-13880-170-3.
  This book defines many of the MIPS specific technical standards like calling
  conventions, ELF properties, and much more that is being used by Linux/MIPS.
  Unfortunately it's out of print.  Similarly, the site
  <em>"http://www.mipsabi.org/"</em> is offline.

  <sect1>The mips.com site<p>
  Under <url url="http://www.mips.com/publications"> there are various PDF
  documents and data sheets about individual processors.

  <sect1>The NEC site<p>
  NEC Electronics (<url url="http://www.necel.com"> includes complete manuals
  about their VR41xx processors.
