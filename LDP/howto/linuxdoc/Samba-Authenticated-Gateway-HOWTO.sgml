This document intends to show how to build a Firewall/Gateway
 with rules set on user basis having the users authenticated by a
 Samba Primary Domain Controller

</abstract>
<sect>
Introduction
<p>
As you can see by the poorness of my language, English is not
 my native language. I am writing this document in English for the
 sake of the Linux community. So, please, excuse me for my poor English.
 And, please, if you speak Portuguese, address me in this language.

</p>
<p>
This document intends to enlighten you (and myself) in the process
 of building a Linux Gateway or Firewall, which modify rules on demand
 when users log in or out from their Windows workstations.

</p>
<p>
I should be writing an application, but I am too lazy. Hopefully
 when the idea is out there, people will build a few intelligently
 integrated packages. Meanwhile...

</p>
<p>
In this document, I will try to show how to build a gateway to
 NAT or MASQUERADE Windows workstations. Use your imagination to modify
 it to get any level of network management. You may use it to grant
 or deny access to services, servers or entire subnetworks on your
 network.

</p>
<p>
Imagine that you have to build a gateway to let Windows workstation
 access the Internet and that you need to authenticate each user before
 letting them access the external networks. The first solution you
 think about is Squid. It's indeed a great solution, when http and
 ftp access is enough for your users. When it comes to let them access
 other services like pop, smtp, ssh, a database server or whatever
 else, you immediately think about NAT or MASQUERADE. But what happens
 to the user authentication?

</p>
<p>
Well, this is my solution. It gives you user authentication and
 fine grain control over their access to the external networks.

</p>
<sect1>
Overview
<p>
We know that SAMBA can act as a Domain Controller and so it can
 authenticate users on Windows boxes. As a PDC, SAMBA can push netlogon
 scripts to the Windows workstations. We can use this netlogon scripts
 to force the Windows workstations mounting a given share from our
 Linux PDC. This "forced" share shall have preexec and postexec scripts
 which shall be triggered when the user logs in or out. There is a
 program named smbstatus which lists the shares being used, giving
 us also the username and ip address of the workstation. We just need
 to grep this information from smbstatus output and update our firewall
 rules.

<sect>
Requirements
<sect1>
Knowledge
<p>
This document is target at the seasoned systems administrator.

</p>
<p>
You must have a fair knowledge about (at least know what these
 are):

</p>

<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
TCP/IP; 
 <item>
Linux netfilter; 
 <item>
A scripting language (bash?); 
 <item>
SAMBA and Windows networking and domain controllers; 

</itemize>
</p><p>
Fortunately, there is plenty of documentation on these topics
 on the Internet.

</p>
<sect1>
Software
<p>
Installed on your server, you will need at least:

</p>

<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
Samba;
 <item>
Iptables;
 <item>
A scripting language;

</itemize>
</p><sect>
Linux box setup
<p>
This Howto assumes you have a kernel from the 2.4 series as it
 uses iptables. Other than that, there are no known issues why this
 should not work on a 2.2 kernel box with the scripts adapted to ipchains.

</p>
<p>
Of course, you need to install the iptables userland tools, an
 apache http server if you want to run a CGI tool to change passwords
 and SAMBA. And you will need a kernel compiled with iptables modules.

</p>
<p>
You may wish to use DHCP. If so, it is easy to set up. Remember
 to configure the dhcp server to give the nameserver IP address and
 the gateway IP address as well. The Windows machines will make good
 use of this information.

</p>
<sect1>
Basic system setup
<p>
Generally any basic system setup from the common Linux distributions
 will fit in this gateway example. Just check if you have Samba and
 IPTABLES.

</p>
<sect1>
Additional directory hierarchy
<p>
The additional directory hierarchy will be required to accomplish
 the example of this howto:

</p>
<p>
This is used to keep track of the users and IP addresses:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
/var/run/smbgate/

</verb>
</p><p>
This is where I place user specific scripts:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
/etc/smbgate/users/

</verb>
</p><p>
And group specific scripts:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
/etc/smbgate/groups/

</verb>
</p><p>
Directory for the netlogon share:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
/home/samba/netlogon/

</verb>
</p><p>
Directory for the tracking share:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
/home/samba/samba/

</verb>
</p><p>
These hierarchies are required by some of the scripts and daemons
 of the example.

</p>
<sect1>
Firewall setup
<p>
Its very unlikely that your distribution's kernel won't be compiled
 with Iptables and the userland tools won't be installed either. Anyway,
 if you don't have it, refer to <url url="http://www.netfilter.org" name="http://www.netfilter.org"> or <url url="http://www.iptables.org" name="http://www.iptables.org"> to get the software and the documentation.

</p>
<p>
You will need a basic firewall setup in order to get the gateway
 working. Take a look at the iptables tutorial at <url url="http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/tutorials/blueflux/iptables-tutorial.html" name="IPTABLES TUTORIAL">. It's an interesting
 reading. Anyway, if you have no time to spend, the following code
 is somewhat (very) loose but it may fit your needs:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
&num;!/bin/sh
IPTABLES=/usr/sbin/iptables
/sbin/depmod -a
/sbin/insmod ip_tables
/sbin/insmod ip_conntrack
/sbin/insmod ip_conntrack_ftp
/sbin/insmod ip_conntrack_irc
/sbin/insmod iptable_nat
/sbin/insmod ip_nat_ftp
echo &quot;1&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
echo &quot;1&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_dynaddr
&dollar;IPTABLES -P INPUT ACCEPT
&dollar;IPTABLES -F INPUT 
&dollar;IPTABLES -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
&dollar;IPTABLES -F OUTPUT
&dollar;IPTABLES -P FORWARD ACCEPT
&dollar;IPTABLES -F FORWARD 
&dollar;IPTABLES -t nat -F

</verb>
</p><p>
You will notice that this code actually does nothing, but load
 the kernel modules related to nat and firewalling and turns the packet
 routing on. You can (and should) place any rules there to give your
 gateway a standard behavior, but the big magic will be done by scripts
 called by the SAMBA daemon.

</p>
<p>
Please, remember that this code doesn't have the least bit of
 security! Don't use these examples in production environments. This
 example intends only to be educational. You have to add a firewall
 configuration that suits your systems.

</p>
<p>
You have been warned!

</p>
<sect1>
SAMBA setup
<p>
Check if you have Samba installed. If your distribution doesn't
 come with Samba pre-packaged then refer to <url url="http://www.samba.org" name="http://www.samba.org"> to get the packages and
 for documentation on how to install Samba. Brows around their web
 site and learn about it. The site has plenty of documentation and
 maybe your LINUX distribution also has plenty of SAMBA documentation.

</p>
<p>
We will need to setup SAMBA as a Primary Domain Controller. I
 will give an example configuration file here, but you should read
 the <url url="http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection.html" name="Samba HOWTO Collection"> and learn all you can about a PDC.

</p>
<sect2>
Basic SAMBA setup.
<p>
Since I do not intend to rewrite the SAMBA documentation, here
 goes a sample smb.conf file:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
&num; Global parameters
&lsqb;global&rsqb;
workgroup = DOMAIN
netbios name = LINUX
server string = Linux PDC
encrypt passwords = Yes
map to guest = Bad Password
passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd
unix password sync = Yes
max log size = 50
time server = Yes
socket options = TCP_NODELAY SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192
add user script = /usr/sbin/useradd -d /dev/null -g 100 -s /bin/false -M &percnt;u
logon script = &percnt;a.bat
domain logons = Yes
os level = 64
lm announce = True
preferred master = True
domain master = True
dns proxy = No
printing = lprng
&lsqb;homes&rsqb;
comment = Home Directories
path = /home/&percnt;u
read only = No
&lsqb;printers&rsqb;
comment = All Printers
path = /var/spool/samba
printable = Yes
browseable = No
available = No
&lsqb;netlogon&rsqb;
comment = NetLogon ShARE
path = /home/samba/netlogon
guest account = 
&lsqb;samba&rsqb;
comment = login tracking share
path = /home/samba/samba
browseable = No
root preexec = /usr/local/bin/netlogon.sh &percnt;u &percnt;I
root postexec = /usr/local/bin/netlogoff.sh &percnt;u

</verb>
</p><p>
You will have to do with it or read the SAMBA documentation if
 you really want to control your server and network.

</p>
<sect2>
The "logon script"
<p>
Using "logon script = &percnt;a.bat" makes samba evaluate the guest
 os and call an appropriated logon script. If you want a static script,
 just change to "logon script = netlogon.bat". Actually you can do anything
 here and even generate any script during the logon.

</p>
<sect2>
The netlogon and the tracking shares
<p>
The netlogon share is where the Windows workstations download
 the logon script from. We need this share in order to place there
 a logon script, which will tell the workstation to mount a share
 that will be used to track the users ip addresses.

</p>
<p>
As you can see, there must be a line like the following in your
 smb.conf

</p>

<p>
<verb>
logon script = netlogon.bat

</verb>
</p><p>
This line will tell your Windows client to download and execute
 the script named netlogon.bat. This script must be placed at the
 netlogon share. So, we will also need a netlogon.bat script to your
 Windows workstations. You can use the following example and place
 it at the netlogon share, in this case: /home/samba/netlogon/NETLOGON.BAT.

</p>

<p>
<verb>
REM NETLOGON.BAT
net use z: &bsol;&bsol;linux&bsol;samba /yes

</verb>
</p><p>
This script will tell the Windows workstation to mount the specified
 share, and so we will be able to keep track of the user and workstation
 through the output of the smbstatus program.

</p>
<p>
Quite simple! But not enough...

</p>
<p>
As you could see, we will need also a tracking share which, in
 this example, I named samba. You can see the tracking share configuration
 in smb.conf:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
&lsqb;samba&rsqb;
comment = login tracking share
path = /home/samba/samba
browseable = No
root preexec = /usr/local/bin/netlogon.sh &percnt;u &percnt;I
root postexec = /usr/local/bin/netlogoff.sh &percnt;u

</verb>
</p><p>
As you can guess or know if you read the SAMBA documentation,
 the root preexec and the root postexec lines tell SAMBA to run the
 indicated scripts when a user mounts or unmounts the share. In this
 case, we are passing the username to the script as a parameter. Note
 the &percnt;u at the end of the lines. These scripts are the beasts
 which will call a script or program to modify our gateway's packet
 filtering rules.

</p>
<p>
Note that the netlogon.sh script must check if the refered workstation
 has already mounted the tracking share.

</p>
<p>
Take a look at the netlogon.sh and netlogoff.sh scripts:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
&num;!/bin/sh
&num;
&num; netlogon.sh
&num;
&num; usage:
&num; netlogon.sh &lt;username&gt;
&num;
if &lsqb; -f /var/run/smbgate/&dollar;1 &rsqb; ; then
    exit 0
fi
echo &dollar;2 &gt; /var/run/smbgate/&dollar;1
IPTABLES='/usr/sbin/iptables'
EXTIF='eth0'
COMMAND='-A'
ADDRESS=`cat /var/run/smbgate/&dollar;1`
GROUP=`groups &dollar;1 | gawk '// &lcub; print &dollar;3 &rcub;'`
if &lsqb; -f /etc/smbgate/users/&dollar;1 &rsqb; ; then
    /etc/smbgate/users/&dollar;1 &dollar;COMMAND &dollar;ADDRESS &dollar;EXTIF
else
    if &lsqb; -f /etc/smbgate/groups/&dollar;GROUP &rsqb; ; then
        /etc/smbgate/groups/&dollar;GROUP &dollar;COMMAND &dollar;ADDRESS &dollar;EXTIF
    else
        /etc/smbgate/users/default.sh &dollar;COMMAND &dollar;ADDRESS &dollar;EXTIF
    fi
fi


</verb>
</p><p>
This script (netlogon.sh) is intended to run when the user logs
 in and will select the which scripts will be executed based on the
 user name and to which group the user belongs. The user's ip address
 will be written to a file at /var/run/smbgate for tracking purposes.
 The file will take the user's name and will be later used when the
 user log off. The IP address will be passed as an argument to a script
 with the users' name which will finally update the firewall.

</p>
<p>
Notice that this netlogon.sh script tries a user script, then
 if it can't find the user script it tries a group script, and finally
 if it can't find the group script it tries the default.sh script.
 You can modify this logic and behavior as you wish and need, just
 remember to modify the others accordingly. 

</p>
<p>
Chances are if the user belong to more than one that these scripts
 will fail. I did not have time to write a better code.

</p>

<p>
<verb>
&num;!/bin/sh
&num;
&num; netlogoff.sh
&num;
&num; usage:
&num; netlogoff.sh &lt;username&gt;
&num;
IPTABLES='/usr/sbin/iptables'
EXTIF='ppp0'
COMMAND='-D'
TRACKSHARE=&quot;samba&quot;
ADDRESS=`cat /var/run/smbgate/&dollar;1`
GROUP=`groups &dollar;1 | gawk '// &lcub; print &dollar;3 &rcub;'`
NM=`smbstatus -u &dollar;1 | grep &dollar;TRACKSHARE | wc -l`
if &lsqb; &dollar;NM -gt 0 &rsqb;; then
    exit
fi
if &lsqb; -f /etc/smbgate/users/&dollar;1 &rsqb; ; then
    /etc/smbgate/users/&dollar;1 &dollar;COMMAND &dollar;ADDRESS &dollar;EXTIF
else
    if &lsqb; -f /etc/smbgate/groups/&dollar;GROUP &rsqb; ; then
        /etc/smbgate/groups/&dollar;GROUP &dollar;COMMAND &dollar;ADDRESS &dollar;EXTIF
    else
        /etc/smbgate/users/default.sh &dollar;COMMAND &dollar;ADDRESS &dollar;EXTIF
    fi
fi
rm -f /var/run/smbgate/&dollar;1

</verb>
</p><p>
This script (netlogoff.sh) is intended to run when the user logs
 off and will get the address from the /var/run/smbgate/user file
 which will be passed as an argument to the /etc/smbgate/users/user
 script which will update the firewall to the state desired when the
 user is not logged in.

</p>
<p>
Some versions of Windows, such as Windows 2000, mount the tracking
 share more than once per login. This may cause problems with the
 netlogon.sh and netlogoff.sh, triggering the scripts more the once.
 This can make a real mess. So, you may prefer to use a logout checking
 script at cron instead of a netlogoff.sh script triggered by SAMBA.
 Here is an example:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
&num;!/bin/sh
&num; checklogout.sh
&num;
&num; usage:
&num; intended to run at cron (maybe each 10 minutes)

TRACKDIR=&quot;/var/run/smbgate&quot;
DIRLENGTH=&dollar;&lcub;&num;TRACKDIR&rcub;
TRACKSHARE=&quot;samba&quot;
EXTIF='eth0'
COMMAND='-D'
if &lsqb; -d &dollar;TRACKDIR &rsqb;; then
  for n in &dollar;TRACKDIR/*; do
    &lsqb; -d &dollar;n &rsqb; &amp;&amp; continue;
    if &lsqb; -f &dollar;n &rsqb; ; then 
      IPADDRESS=`cat &dollar;n`
      USERNAME=&dollar;&lcub;n:&dollar;DIRLENGTH+1&rcub;
      NMS=`smbstatus -u &dollar;USERNAME | grep &dollar;TRACKSHARE | grep &dollar;IPADDRESS | grep -v grep | wc -l`
      if &lsqb; &dollar;NMS == 0 &rsqb; ; then
        rm -f &dollar;n
        GROUP=`groups &dollar;USERNAME | gawk '// &lcub; print &dollar;3 &rcub;'`
        if &lsqb; -f /etc/smbgate/users/&dollar;USERNAME &rsqb; ; then
          /etc/smbgate/users/&dollar;USERNAME &dollar;COMMAND &dollar;IPADDRESS &dollar;EXTIF
        else
          if &lsqb; -f /etc/smbgate/groups/&dollar;GROUP &rsqb; ; then
            /etc/smbgate/groups/&dollar;GROUP &dollar;COMMAND &dollar;IPADDRESS &dollar;EXTIF
          else
            /etc/smbgate/users/default.sh &dollar;COMMAND &dollar;IPADDRESS &dollar;EXTIF
          fi
        fi
      fi
    else
      exit 0
    fi
  done
fi 

</verb>
</p><p>
In that case you should remove the root postexec clause from
 the tracking share on smb.conf:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
root postexec = /usr/local/bin/netlogoff.sh &percnt;u

</verb>
</p><p>
The following is a standard /etc/smbgate/users/user script. This
 is the one which will actually modify the firewall rules.

</p>

<p>
<verb>
&num;!/bin/sh
&num;
COMMAND=&dollar;1
ADDRESS=&dollar;2
EXTIF=&dollar;3
IPTABLES='/usr/sbin/iptables'
&dollar;IPTABLES &dollar;COMMAND POSTROUTING -t nat -s &dollar;ADDRESS -o &dollar;EXTIF -j MASQUERADE

</verb>
</p><p>
We should also have a default.sh script at /etc/smbgate/users/
 to give the gateway a default behavior.

</p>

<p>
<verb>
&num;!/bin/sh
&num;
&num; default.sh
COMMAND=&dollar;1
ADDRESS=&dollar;2
EXTIF=&dollar;3
IPTABLES='/usr/sbin/iptables'
&num;&dollar;IPTABLES &dollar;COMMAND POSTROUTING -t nat -s &dollar;ADDRESS -o &dollar;EXTIF -j MASQUERADE
exit 0

</verb>
</p><sect>
SSH setup
<p>
You may want to run your PDC on one box and have another box
 as a managed gateway for any reason. If so you must setup your gateway
 to accept rsa authenticated logins without passwords from the PDC.

</p>
<p>
Take a look at <url url="http://www.openssh.org/manual.html" name="www.openssh.org"> for information on how to properly setup your
 ssh server and client for this.

</p>
<sect1>
Important
<p>
You should read the ssh documentation and make shure that you
 fully understand what you are doing when you setup rsa or any other
 kind of cryptographic authentication.

</p>
<p>
If security isn't an issue, just use my example and go on.

</p>
<sect1>
Key pair generation
<p>
To create a key pair issue the following commands on the manchine
 meant to be the PDC:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
pdc:&tilde;&num; ssh-keygen -t rsa

</verb>
</p><p>
Answer the questions and copy the resulting public key to the
 gateway it self. Usually the public key goes to "&tilde;.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

</p>

<p>
<verb>
pdc:&tilde;&num; cd .ssh
pdc:&tilde;&num; scp id_rsa.pub root@gateway:/root/.ssh/authorized_keys2

</verb>
</p><sect1>
SSH enabled logon script
<p>
The following is a standard /etc/smbgate/users/user script modified
 to use the ssh cryptographic authentication.

</p>

<p>
<verb>
&num;!/bin/sh
&num;
COMMAND=&dollar;1
ADDRESS=&dollar;2
EXTIF=&dollar;3
IPTABLES='/sbin/iptables'
ssh root@gateway &dollar;IPTABLES &dollar;COMMAND POSTROUTING -t nat -s &dollar;ADDRESS -o &dollar;EXTIF -j MASQUERADE

</verb>
</p><p>
Note that the iptables binary in called through ssh at the "gateway".
 Again, make sure that you read the ssh server documentation.

</p>
<sect>
Windows workstation setup
<sect1>
Introduction
<p>
We will stick to setting up the network, user management and
 policies on the Windows workstations.

</p>
<p>
I will not go through all those steps, naming each dialog box.
 I will presume that if you can read and understand this document
 you can find your way through that mess.

</p>
<sect1>
Network protocols
<p>
First, unless you really need, remove all network protocols but
 TCP/IP. Even without their own protocol, Windows machines like to
 broadcast a lot, and this doesn't please anyone. Anyway, with TCP/IP
 who needs anything else?

</p>
<sect1>
DHCP setup
<p>
If you setup a DHCP server on your Linux box, remember that Windows
 workstations can get the nameservers and gateway's address besides
 its own IP address from it. So, you don't need to set all these items
 on each workstation.

</p>
<sect1>
Join your Linux server domain
<p>
Configure the Windows workstation to log in a Domain, and give
 the domain name of your Linux server. This is essential to the gateway
 work.

</p>
<p>
You must know that in order to join some versions of Windows
 to a SAMBA domain controller, you must create machine accounts in
 your Linux PDC. Check the SAMBA documentation on how to setup your
 PDC to the specific version of Windows which you have.

</p>
<sect2>
Windows fo workgroups
<p>
This version seems to need no special configuration to join the
 Linux PDC domain.

</p>
<p>
The netlogon script shall be named "WfWg.bat" so when &percnt;a
 is translated the right script is chosen.

</p>
<p>
Example:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
REM WFWG.BAT
net use z: &bsol;&bsol;linux&bsol;samba /yes

</verb>
</p><sect2>
Windows 95/98/ME
<p>
These versions also seems to need no special configuration to
 join the Linux PDC domain.

</p>
<p>
The netlogon script shall be named "Win95.bat" so when &percnt;a
 is translated the right script is chosen.

<verb>
REM WIN95.BAT
net use z: &bsol;&bsol;linux&bsol;samba /yes

</verb>
</p><sect2>
Windows NT
<p>
This version requires machine accounts at the Linux box. Check
 the SAMBA documentation.

</p>
<p>
The netlogon script shall be named "WinNT.bat" so when &percnt;a
 is translated the right script is chosen.

</p>
<p>
Example:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
REM WINNT.BAT
net use z: &bsol;&bsol;linux&bsol;samba /yes /persistent:no

</verb>
</p><sect2>
Windows 2000
<p>
This version requires machine accounts at the Linux box. Again,
 check the SAMBA documentation.

</p>
<p>
The netlogon script shall be named "Win2K.bat" so when &percnt;a
 is translated the right script is chosen.

</p>
<p>
Example:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
REM WIN2K.BAT
net use z: &bsol;&bsol;linux&bsol;samba /yes /persistent:no

</verb>
</p><sect2>
Windows XP
<p>
This version needs a machine account at the Linux box and a tweak
 at the registry, as follows.

</p>
<p>
Locate the key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&bsol;SYSTEM&bsol;CurrentControlSet&bsol;Services&bsol;Netlogon&bsol;Parameters&bsol;RequireSignOrSeal".
 The default value is 1. Set it to 0 and it will no more complain
 about joining the domain.

</p>
<p>
If you have many workstation to configure create a file named
 anything.reg with the following content and use it to modify the
 "faulty" registry.

</p>

<p>
<verb>
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

&lsqb;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&bsol;SYSTEM&bsol;CurrentControlSet&bsol;Services&bsol;Netlogon&bsol;Parameters&rsqb;
&quot;requiresignorseal&quot;=dword:00000000

</verb>
</p><p>
This version also needs an adjust at the logon script. Sometimes
 it insists on making the mounting persistent. The netlogon script
 shall be named "WinXP.bat" so when &percnt;a is translated the right
 script is chosen.

</p>
<p>
Example:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
REM WINXP.BAT
net use z: &bsol;&bsol;linux&bsol;samba /yes /persistent:no

</verb>

Policy editor
<p>
There is a utility named policy editor bundled on the Windows
 CD. The file name is poledit.exe. This tool, as the name suggest,
 allows to create a user and system policy file.

</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, this tool does not generate a plain text configuration
 file, so I can't place an example here.

</p>
<p>
Use the policy editor to create a policy to your workstations
 and users. You should disable the local password cache and domain
 cache in order to get some security. Save the policy file as config.pol
 and place it at the netlogon share of your Linux server. In this
 way, your Windows workstations will download and use the config.pol
 file to set their policy. Of course this task must be done on a Windows
 machine.

</p>
<p>
If you don't use a config.pol file, your Windows workstations
 will annoy you asking for a Windows password and you will become
 nuts trying to synchronize and manage your Domain and Windows passwords.
 It seems that the OS doesn't know that it joined a domain. You must
 tell it and then you have to slap it in the face so it will believe
 you.

</p>
<sect>
User management
<sect1>
Adding users
<p>
Adding a Linux user by usual means and setting a samba password
 using smbpasswd will work. If you have any doubt, just refer to the
 SAMBA documentation. This is not a difficult issue.

</p>
<sect1>
Password management
<p>
I am issuing this a major topic because I couldn't learn yet
 how to manage users and users' passwords from a Windows workstation
 without using a web interface. I couldn't find and didn't know how
 to build integrated tools to solve this problem. So, I am using a
 CGI program to get it done.

</p>
<p>
Try the package at <url url="http://changepassword.sourceforge.net" name="http://changepassword.sourceforge.net">, it seems to be a good choice.

</p>
<sect1>
Granting or denying access to users
<p>
As you could see in a previous section of this howto, the SAMBA
 daemon will call a netlogon.sh script every time the tracking share
 is mounted. This netlogon.sh script will call a script with the user's
 name giving this script the ip address of the refered workstation
 as a parameter. This user script will apply the desired rules.

</p>
<p>
For example if you want to give the user full access to internet:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
&num;!/bin/sh
&num;
COMMAND=&dollar;1
ADDRESS=&dollar;2
EXTIF=&dollar;3
IPTABLES='/usr/sbin/iptables'
&dollar;IPTABLES &dollar;COMMAND POSTROUTING -t nat -s &dollar;ADDRESS -o &dollar;EXTIF -j MASQUERADE

</verb>
</p><p>
If you don't want to change anything to a particular user, just
 give him an empty script:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
&num;/bin/sh
&num;
exit 0

</verb>
</p><p>
Or just don't create any script for the less privileged users,
 letting them have the default.sh script, which would be empty as
 the previous or just give limited access as follows:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
&num;!/bin/sh
&num;
COMMAND=&dollar;1
ADDRESS=&dollar;2
EXTIF=&dollar;3
EXTIFADDRESS=&dollar;4
IPTABLES='/usr/sbin/iptables'
&dollar;IPTABLES &dollar;COMMAND POSTROUTING -t nat -s &dollar;ADDRESS -o &dollar;EXTIF --dport 25 -j SNAT --to-source &dollar;EXTIFADDRESS
&dollar;IPTABLES &dollar;COMMAND POSTROUTING -t nat -s &dollar;ADDRESS -o &dollar;EXTIF --dport 110 -j SNAT --to-source &dollar;EXTIFADDRESS

</verb>
</p><p>
Remember that this script requires you to modify all the previous
 scripts to include the extra parameter ou just modify the script
 script. And remember that you will go nowhere whis this howto if
 you don't understand iptables.

</p>
<sect>
Group management
<sect1>
Creating groups
<p>
Just create your user groups in the Linux PDC and add the users
 to the groups. This is it.

</p>
<p>
Remember that the example scripts in this howto will probably
 fail if you have users belonging to more than one group. If you need
 this, remember to adjust the scripts.

</p>
<sect1>
Group policy
<p>
You will need to define group specific scripts and place them
 in the directory "/etc/smbgate/groups/". Remember that the script must
 be named as the group, at least if you want to follow the examples
 in this howto.

</p>
<p>
The default scheme of this howto is to check for a user script,
 then for a group script and finally for the default script. If you
 want to modify this behavior remember to adapt the netlogon.sh, netlogoff.sh
 (or the checklogout.sh) scripts. The whole logic is in these scripts.

GNU Free Documentation License Version 1.2, November 2002

</p>
<p>
Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59
 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted
 to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document,
 but changing it is not allowed.

</p>
<p>
0. PREAMBLE

</p>
<p>
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
 other functional and useful document &quot;free&quot; in the sense
 of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
 redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially
 or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author
 and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being
 considered responsible for modifications made by others.

</p>
<p>
This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that
 derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same
 sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a
 copyleft license designed for free software.

</p>
<p>
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
 for free software, because free software needs free documentation:
 a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
 that the software does. But this License is not limited to software
 manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject
 matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend
 this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or
 reference.

</p>
<p>
1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

</p>
<p>
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
 that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
 be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants
 a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use
 that work under the conditions stated herein. The &quot;Document&quot;,
 below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public
 is a licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. You accept the
 license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring
 permission under copyright law.

</p>
<p>
A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work
 containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim,
 or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

</p>
<p>
A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter
 section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship
 of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
 subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
 directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in
 part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
 any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
 connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
 commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
 them.

</p>
<p>
The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections
 whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
 in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
 License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary
 then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document
 may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify
 any Invariant Sections then there are none.

</p>
<p>
The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text
 that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
 notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
 A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text
 may be at most 25 words.

</p>
<p>
A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable
 copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to
 the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly
 with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic
 paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor,
 and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
 translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters.
 A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup,
 or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
 modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not
 Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that
 is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.

</p>
<p>
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
 ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
 or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
 HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples
 of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
 include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary
 word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing
 tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
 PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes
 only.

</p>
<p>
The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title
 page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
 the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For
 works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title
 Page&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
 work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

</p>
<p>
A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the
 Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
 following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ
 stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
 &quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.)
 To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot; of such a section when you modify
 the Document means that it remains a section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot;
 according to this definition.

</p>
<p>
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
 which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
 Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
 but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication
 that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect
 on the meaning of this License.

</p>
<p>
2. VERBATIM COPYING

</p>
<p>
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
 commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
 copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
 to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
 other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not
 use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
 copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
 compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
 number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

</p>
<p>
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
 and you may publicly display copies.

</p>
<p>
3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

</p>
<p>
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
 have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
 the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
 the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
 Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts
 on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
 you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present
 the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
 visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying
 with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the
 title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
 as verbatim copying in other respects.

</p>
<p>
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
 fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
 reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
 pages.

</p>
<p>
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
 more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
 copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque
 copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using
 public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
 a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
 If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
 when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
 that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
 location until at least one year after the last time you distribute
 an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of
 that edition to the public.

</p>
<p>
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors
 of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
 to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
 Document.

</p>
<p>
4. MODIFICATIONS

</p>
<p>
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
 under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
 release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
 Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
 distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
 possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in
 the Modified Version:

</p>
<p>
A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
 distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
 (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
 of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version
 if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List
 on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible
 for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together
 with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all
 of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they
 release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the
 name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.
 D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an
 appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the
 other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright
 notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the
 Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown
 in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full
 lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the
 Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
 I. Preserve the section Entitled &quot;History&quot;, Preserve its
 Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
 authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title
 Page. If there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the
 Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher
 of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing
 the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve
 the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access
 to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations
 given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These
 may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section. You may omit a
 network location for a work that was published at least four years
 before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
 it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;
 or &quot;Dedications&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and
 preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the
 contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L.
 Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
 their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent
 are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section
 Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;. Such a section may not be included
 in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to
 be Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot; or to conflict in title with
 any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

</p>
<p>
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
 appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
 copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or
 all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles
 to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license
 notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

</p>
<p>
You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided
 it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
 various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the
 text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition
 of a standard.

</p>
<p>
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
 and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
 of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage
 of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
 through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
 includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you
 or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf
 of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on
 explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old
 one.

</p>
<p>
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
 License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
 assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

</p>
<p>
5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

</p>
<p>
You may combine the Document with other documents released under
 this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
 versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
 Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified,
 and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in
 its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

</p>
<p>
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License,
 and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a
 single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same
 name but different contents, make the title of each such section
 unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
 original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
 unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
 the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined
 work.

</p>
<p>
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot;
 in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled &quot;History&quot;;
 likewise combine any sections Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
 and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;. You must delete
 all sections Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.

</p>
<p>
6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

</p>
<p>
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
 documents released under this License, and replace the individual
 copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
 that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
 rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
 in all other respects.

</p>
<p>
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
 distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
 a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
 License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
 document.

</p>
<p>
7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

</p>
<p>
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
 and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage
 or distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the
 copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
 legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
 works permit. When the Document is included an aggregate, this License
 does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not
 themselves derivative works of the Document.

</p>
<p>
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
 copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
 of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
 on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
 electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
 form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the
 whole aggregate.

</p>
<p>
8. TRANSLATION

</p>
<p>
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
 distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
 permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations
 of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions
 of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this
 License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warrany
 Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English
 version of this License and the original versions of those notices
 and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation
 and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer,
 the original version will prevail.

</p>
<p>
If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
 &quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement
 (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require
 changing the actual title.

</p>
<p>
9. TERMINATION

</p>
<p>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
 except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt
 to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and
 will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
 parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
 License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
 remain in full compliance.

</p>
<p>
10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

</p>
<p>
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
 of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new
 versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
 differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

</p>
<p>
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
 number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version
 of this License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you
 have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
 specified version or of any later version that has been published
 (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document
 does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
 any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
 Foundation.

</p>
<p>
ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

</p>
<p>
To use this License in a document you have written, include a
 copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright
 and license notices just after the title page:

</p>
<p>
Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy,
 distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU
 Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published
 by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover
 Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included
 in the section entitled &quot;GNU Free Documentation License&quot;.

</p>
<p>
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
 Texts, replace the &quot;with...Texts.&quot; line with this:

</p>
<p>
with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
 Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being
 LIST.

</p>
<p>
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
 combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
 situation.

</p>
<p>
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code,
 we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice
 of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
 to permit their use in free software. 

</p>
