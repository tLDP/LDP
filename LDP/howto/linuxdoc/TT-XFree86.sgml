<sect1>Credits
<p>
I'd like to thank Bear Giles for his Debian TTF howto which brought
me on the right path :o).

Of course, credit should also go to the XFree86 crew, and Joerg
Pommnitz for writing <tt>ttmkfdir</tt>.

Also I'd like to pass a BIG big thank you to the LDP for building and
maintaining a network of helping hands which already guided many
people through the hard to overcome the learning curve Linux has.

<sect1>Translations
<p>
I currently don't know of any translations of this mini-HOWTO, if you want
to make one, just do it and either submit it yourself, or send it to me and
I will credit you and publish it.

<sect>Procedure
<p>
Get a set of ttf fonts from M$, or some fonts of your own, or 
just use your windows partition if you have one and do the 
following as root at the command line:

<em>
<bf>IF</bf> you are using something else than the windows partition method, 
line 2 will (of course) differ. 
</em>

<itemize>
<item><tt>mkdir /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Truetype</tt>
<item><tt>cp /winpartition/windows/fonts/*.ttf /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Truetype</tt>
<item><tt>cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Truetype</tt>
<item><tt>ttmkfdir &gt; fonts.scale</tt>
<item><tt>mkfontdir</tt>
</itemize>

<p>
There you go. You will now have all TrueType fonts working. If you want
to add fonts, just move/copy those [*.ttf files] into the aforementioned
directory, and repeat the process starting from line 3. 

Netscape has problems with these fonts, you have to check the "Allow
Scaling" setting in the Fonts dialog, don't feel distracted by the fact 
that it only shows font sizes 0 and 12. Mozilla has no such problems. 
Opera neither.

The <tt>mkfontdir</tt> executable should be included with your 
XFree 4.0.x distribution.

If you are missing <tt>ttmkfdir</tt>, you can obtain it here:

The latest verion of XFree86 (currently 4.0.2) can be found at:
