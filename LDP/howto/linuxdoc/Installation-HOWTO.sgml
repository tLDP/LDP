<title>The Linux Installation HOWTO
<author>by Eric S. Raymond
<date>v4.22, 19 January 2000

<abstract>
This document describes how to obtain and install Linux software.
It is the first document which a new Linux user should read to get
started. 
</abstract>

<toc>

<sect>Introduction
<p>

<sect1> Purpose of this document
<p>
Linux is a freely-distributable implementation of Unix for
inexpensive personal machines (it was developed on 386s, and now
supports 486, 586, Pentium, PowerPC, Sun Sparc and DEC Alpha
hardware). It supports a wide range of software, including X
Windows, Emacs, TCP/IP networking (including SLIP), and many
applications.

This document assumes that you have heard of and know about Linux,
and now want to get it running.  It focuses on the Intel
base version, which is the most popular, but much of the advice
applies on Power PCs, Sparcs and Alphas as well.

<sect1>Other sources of information
<p>
If you are new to Linux, there are several sources of basic
information about the system. The best place to find these is at
the <idx>Linux Documentation Project</idx> home page at <url
url="http://www.linuxdoc.org">.  You can find the
latest, up-to-date version of this document there, as <url
url="&howto;Installation-HOWTO.html">

You should probably start by browsing the resources under General
Linux Information; the Linux <url
url="&howto;INFO-SHEET.html"
name="INFO-SHEET"> and the Linux <url
url="&howto;META-FAQ.html"
name="META-FAQ">.  The `Linux Frequently Asked Questions' document
contains many common questions (and answers!) about Linux---it is a
``must read'' for new users.

You can find help for common problems on the USENET newsgroups <htmlurl
url="news:comp.os.linux.help" name="comp.os.linux.help"> and
<htmlurl url="news:comp.os.linux.announce"
name="comp.os.linux.announce">.

The Linux Documentation Project is writing a set of manuals and
books about Linux, all of which are freely distributable on the
net and available from the LDP home page.

The book <em/``Linux Installation and Getting Started''/ is a
complete guide to getting and installing Linux, as well as how to
use the system once you've installed it. It contains a complete
tutorial to using and running the system, and much more information
than is contained here.  You can browse it, or download a copy,
from the LDP home page.

Finally, there is a rather technical <url name="Guide to x86
Bootstrapping" url="http://www.paranoia.com/~vax/boot.html">.
This document is NetBSD- rather than Linux-oriented, but contains
useful material on disk configuration and boot managers for
multi-OS setups.

Please do <em>not</em> email me asking for installation help.  Even
if I had the time to handle such requests, troubleshooting by mail
is much less efficient than asking help from your local Linux user's
group.  You can find worldwide contact information for Linux user
groups on the <url url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/" name="LDP site">.

<sect1>New versions of this document

<p>
New versions of the Linux Installation HOWTO will be periodically posted to
<htmlurl url="news:comp.os.linux.help" name="comp.os.linux.help"> and
<htmlurl url="news:comp.os.linux.announce" name="comp.os.linux.announce">
and <htmlurl url="news:news.answers" name="news.answers">.  They will also
be uploaded to various Linux WWW and FTP sites, including the LDP home
page.

You can also view the latest version of this on the World Wide
Web via the URL 
<url url="&howto;Installation-HOWTO.html">.

<sect1>Feedback and Corrections
<p>
If you have questions or comments about this document, please feel
free to mail Eric S. Raymond, at <htmlurl
url="mailto:esr@thyrsus.com" name="esr@thyrsus.com">. I welcome any
suggestions or criticisms. If you find a mistake with this
document, please let me know so I can correct it in the next
version. Thanks.

Please do <em/not/ mail me questions about how to solve hardware
problems encountered during installation.  Consult <em/``Linux
Installation and Getting Started''/, bug your vendor, or consult
the Linux newsgroup <htmlurl url="news:comp.os.linux.setup"
name="comp.os.linux.setup">.  This HOWTO is intended to be rapid,
painless guide to <em/normal/ installation -- a separate HOWTO on
hardware problems and diagnosis is in preparation.

<sect>Recent Changes
<p>
<itemize>
<item>Added the `Buy, Don't Build'.
<item>Added the material on booting from CD-ROM.
</itemize>

<sect>The Easiest Option: Buy, Don't Build
<p>
Linux has now matured enough that there are now system integrators
who will assemble a workstation for you, install and configure a
Linux, and do an intensive burn-in to test it before it's shipped
to you.  If you have more money than time, or you have stringent
reliability or performance requirements, these integrators provide
a valuable service by making sure you won't get hardware that's
flaky or dies two days out of the box.

There are several firms of this kind (and I'll list them here as I
learn more about them).  The only such outfit I know about
personally is <url name="VA Research"
url="http://www.varesearch.com">.  These good people build
high-end, high quality Linux workstations with a nifty
Tux-the-penguin logo on the front.  They have intimate ties to the
Linux community (the <url name="Debian project"
url="http://www.debian.org"> lives on a machine in their back
room, Linus owns one of their boxes, and they even throw resources
at your humble HOWTO maintainer occasionally).

For those of us without a champagne budget, the rest of this
HOWTO is about how to install Linux yourself.

<sect>Before You Begin
<p>
Before you can install Linux, you'll need to be sure your machine
is Linux-capable, and choose a Linux to install.  The <url
name="Linux Pre-installation checklist"
url="http://members.tripod.com/~algolog/lnxchk.htm"> may
help you organize configuration data before you begin.

<sect1>Hardware requirements
<p>
What kind of system is needed to run Linux? This is a good
question; the actual hardware requirements for the system change
periodically.  The Linux Hardware-HOWTO, <url
url="&howto;Hardware-HOWTO.html">, gives
a (more or less) complete listing of hardware supported by
Linux. The Linux INFO-SHEET, <url
url="&howto;INFO-SHEET.html">, provides
another list.

For the Intel versions, a hardware configuration that looks like the
following is required:

Any <idx>80386</idx>, <idx>80486</idx>, <idx>Pentium</idx> or
<idx>Pentium II</idx> processor will do.  Non-Intel clones of the
80386 and up will generally work. You do not need a math
coprocessor, although it is nice to have one.

The <idx>ISA</idx>, <idx>EISA</idx>, <idx>VESA Local Bus</idx> and
<idx>PCI</idx> bus architectures are supported. The
<idx>MCA</idx> bus architecture (found on IBM PS/2 machines) has been
minimally supported since the 2.1.x kernels, but may not be
ready for prime time yet.

You need at least 4 megabytes of memory in your
machine. Technically, Linux will run with only 2 megs, but most
installations and software require 4. The more memory you have, the
happier you'll be. I suggest 8 or 16 megabytes if you're planning
to use X-Windows.

Of course, you'll need a hard drive and an AT-standard drive
controller. All <idx>MFM</idx>, <idx>RLL</idx>, and <idx>IDE</idx>
drives and controllers should work.  Many SCSI drives and adaptors
are supported as well; the Linux SCSI-HOWTO contains more
information on SCSI.  If you are assembling a system from scratch
to run Linux, the small additional cost of SCSI is well worth it
for the extra performance and reliability it brings.

You will need a 3.5&dquot <idx>floppy drive</idx>.  While
5.25&dquot floppies are supported under Linux, they are
little-enough used that you should not count on disk images
necessarily fitting on them.  (A stripped-down Linux can actually
run on a single floppy, but that's only useful for installation and
certain troubleshooting tasks.)

You also need an <idx>MDA</idx>, Hercules, <idx>CGA</idx>,
<idx>EGA</idx>, <idx>VGA</idx>, or <idx>Super VGA</idx> video card
and monitor.  In general, if your video card and monitor work under
MS-DOS then it should work under Linux. However, if you wish to run
the X window system, there are other restrictions on the supported video
hardware. The Linux XFree86-HOWTO, <url
url="&howto;XFree86-HOWTO.html">,
contains more information about running X and its requirements.

You'll want a <idx>CD-ROM</idx> drive.  If it's <idx>ATAPI</idx>,
<idx>SCSI</idx>, or true <idx>IDE</idx> you should have no problem
making it work (but watch for cheap drives advertising "IDE"
interfaces that aren't true IDE).  If your CD-ROM uses a
proprietary interface card, it's possible the installation kernel
you're going to boot from floppy won't be able to see it -- and an
inaccessible CD-ROM is a installation show-stopper.  Also, CD-ROMs
that attach to your parallel port won't work at all.  If you're in
doubt, consult the Linux CD-ROM HOWTO, <url
url="&howto;CDROM-HOWTO.html"> for a
list and details of supported hardware.

So-called "Plug'n'Play" jumperless cards can be a problem.  Support
for these is under active development, but not there yet in the
2.0.25 kernel.  Fortunately this is only likely to be a problem
with sound or Ethernet cards.

If you're running on a box that uses one of the Motorola 68K
processors (including <idx>Amiga</idx>, <idx>Atari</idx>, or
<idx>VMEbus</idx> machines), see the Linux/m68k FAQ at <url
url="http://www.linux-m68k.org/pub/faq/faq.html"> for
information on minimum requirements and the state of the port.  The
FAQ now says m68k Linux is as stable and usable as the Intel
versions.

<sect1>Space requirements and coexistence
<p>
You'll need free space for Linux on your hard drive. The amount of
space needed depends on how much software you plan to install. Most
installations require somewhere in the ballpark of 200 to 500 megs.
This includes space for the software, swap space (used as virtual
RAM on your machine), and free space for users, and so on.

It's conceivable that you could run a minimal Linux system in 80
megs or less (this used to be common when Linux distributions were
smaller), and it's conceivable that you could use well over 500
megs or more for all of your Linux software. The amount varies
greatly depending on the amount of software you install and how
much space you require. More about this later.

Linux will co-exist with other operating systems, such as MS-DOS,
Microsoft Windows, or OS/2, on your hard drive. (In fact you can
even access MS-DOS files and run some MS-DOS programs from Linux.)
In other words, when partitioning your drive for Linux, MS-DOS or
OS/2 live on their own partitions, and Linux exists on its
own. We'll go into more detail about such ``<idx>dual-boot</idx>''
systems later.

You do NOT need to be running MS-DOS, OS/2, or any other operating
system to use Linux. Linux is a completely different, stand-alone
operating system and does not rely on other OSs for installation
and use.

In all, the minimal setup for Linux is not much more than is
required for most MS-DOS or Windows 3.1 systems sold today (and
it's a good deal less than the minimum for Windows 95!).  If you
have a 386 or 486 with at least 4 megs of RAM, then you'll be happy
running Linux. Linux does not require huge amounts of diskspace,
memory, or processor speed.  Matt Welsh, the originator of this
HOWTO, used to run Linux on a 386/16 MHz (the slowest machine you
can get) with 4 megs of RAM, and was quite happy. The more you want
to do, the more memory (and faster processor) you'll need. In our
experience a 486 with 16 megabytes of RAM running Linux outdoes
several models of expensive workstations.

<sect>Time requirements
<p>
Start to finish, a modern Linux installation from CD-ROM can be expected
to take from ninety minutes to three hours.  

<sect1>Choosing a Linux distribution
<p>
Before you can install Linux, you need to decide on one of the
``distributions'' of Linux which are available. There is no single,
standard release of the Linux software---there are many such
releases.  Each release has its own documentation and installation
instructions.

Linux distributions are available both via anonymous FTP and via
mail order on diskette, tape, and CD-ROM. The Linux Distribution
HOWTO, <url
url="&howto;Distribution-HOWTO.html">,
includes descriptions of many Linux distributions available via FTP
and mail order.

In the dim and ancient past when this HOWTO was first written
(1992-93), most people got Linux by tortuous means involving long
downloads off the Internet or a BBS onto their DOS machines,
followed by an elaborate procedure which transferred the downloads
onto multiple floppy disks.  One of these disks would then be
booted and used to install the other dozen.  With luck (and no
media failures) you'd finish your installation many hours later
with a working Linux.  Or maybe not.

While this path is still possible (and you can download any one of
several distributions from <url
url="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/distributions/">),
there are now much less strenuous ways. The easiest is to buy one
of the high-quality commercial Linux distributions distributed on
CD-ROM, such as Red Hat, Debian, Linux Pro, or WGS.  These are
typically available for less than &dollar;50 at your local
bookstore or computer shop, and will save you many hours of
aggravation.

You can also buy anthology CD-ROMs such as the InfoMagic Linux
Developer's Resource set. These typically include several Linux
distributions and a recent dump of major Linux archive sites, such
as metalab or tsx-11.

In the remainder of this HOWTO we will focus on the steps needed to
install from an anthology CD-ROM, or one of the lower-end
commercial Linuxes that doesn't include a printed installation
manual.  If your Linux includes a paper manual some of this HOWTO may
provide useful background, but you should consult the manual for
detailed installation instructions.

<sect>Installation Overview
<p>

It's wise to collect configuration information on your hardware 
before installing.  Know the vendor and model number of each card
in your machine; collect the IRQs and DMA channel numbers.  You
probably won't need this information -- but if it turns out you do,
you'll need it very badly.

If you want to run a "dual-boot" system (Linux and DOS or
Windows or both), rearrange (repartition) your disk to make room 
for Linux.  If you're wise, you'll <em>back up everything first!</em>

<sect1>First Installation Steps: The Easy Way
<p>
If you have an EIDE/ATAPI CDROM (normal these days), check your machine's
BIOS settings to see if it has the capability to boot from CD-ROM.  Most
machines made after mid-1997 can do this.

If yours is among them, change the settings so that the CD-ROM is checked
first.  This is often in a 'BIOS FEATURES' submenu of the BIOS
configuration menus.

Then insert the installation CD-ROM.  Reboot.  You're started.

If you have a SCSI CDROM you can often still boot from it, but it gets
a little more motherboard/BIOS dependent.  Those who know enough to
spend the extra dollars on a SCSI CDROM drive probably know enough to
figure it out.

<sect1>First Installation Steps: The Hard Way
<p>
<enum>
<item> Make installation floppies.

<item> Boot an installation mini-Linux from the floppies in order
to get access to the CD-ROM.
</enum>

<sect1>Continuing the Installation
<p>
<enum>
<item> Prepare the Linux filesystems.  (If you didn't edit the
disk partition table earlier, you will at this stage.)

<item> Install a basic production Linux from the CD-ROM.

<item> Boot Linux from the hard drive.

<item> (Optional) Install more packages from CD-ROM.
</enum>

<sect1>Basic Parts of an Installation Kit
<p>
Here are the basic parts of an installable distribution:

<itemize>
<item>The README and FAQ files.  These will usually be
located in the top-level directory of your CD-ROM and be readable
once the CD-ROM has been mounted under Linux.  (Depending on how
the CD-ROM was generated, they may even be visible under
DOS/Windows.) It is a good idea to read these files as soon as you
have access to them, to become aware of important updates or
changes.

<item>A number of <idx>bootdisk</idx> images (often in a subdirectory).  If
your CD-ROM is not bootable, one of these is the file that you will
write to a floppy to create the boot disk.  You'll select <bf/one/ of the
above bootdisk images, depending on the type of hardware that you have in your
system.
</itemize>

The issue here is that some hardware drivers conflict with each
other in strange ways, and instead of attempting to debug hardware
problems on your system it's easier to use a boot floppy image with
only the drivers you need enabled.  (This will have the nice side
effect of making your kernel smaller.)

<itemize>
<item>A rescue disk image.  This is a disk containing a basic
kernel and tools for disaster recovery in case something trashes
the kernel or boot block of your hard disk.

<item>RAWRITE.EXE. This is an MS-DOS program that will write
the contents of a file (such as a bootdisk image) directly
to a floppy, without regard to format.
</itemize>

You only need RAWRITE.EXE if you plan to create your boot and
root floppies from an MS-DOS system. If you have access to a UNIX
workstation with a floppy drive instead, you can create the
floppies from there, using the `dd' command, or possibly a
vendor-provided build script.  See the man page for dd(1) and ask
your local UNIX gurus for assistance.

<itemize>
<item>The CD-ROM itself.  The purpose of the boot disk is to get
your machine ready to load the root or installation disks, which in
turn are just devices for preparing your hard disk and copying
portions of the CD-ROM to it.  If your CD-ROM is bootable, you can boot
it and skip right to preparing your disk. 
</itemize>

<sect>Installation In Detail

<sect1>Getting prepared for installation
<p>
Linux makes more effective use of PC hardware than MS-DOS, Windows
or NT, and is accordingly less tolerant of misconfigured hardware.
There are a few things you can do before you start that will lessen
your chances of being stopped by this kind of problem.

First, collect any manuals you have on your hardware -- motherboard,
video card, monitor, modem, etc. -- and put them within easy reach.

Second, gather detailed information on your hardware configuration.
One easy way to do this, if you're running MS-DOS 5.0, or up, is to
print a report from the Microsoft diagnostic utility msd.exe (you
can leave out the TSR, driver, memory-map, environment-strings and
OS-version parts).  Among other things, this will guarantee you
full and correct information on your video card and mouse type,
which will be helpful in configuring X later on.

Third, check your machine for configuration problems with
supported hardware that could cause an un-recoverable lockup
during Linux installation.

<itemize>
<item> It is possible for a DOS/Windows system using IDE hard
drive(s) and CD ROM to be functional even with the master/slave
jumpers on the drives incorrectly set.  Linux won't fly this way.
If in doubt, check your master-slave jumpers!

<item> Is any of your peripheral hardware designed with neither
configuration jumpers nor non-volatile configuration memory?  If
so, it may require boot-time initialization via an MS-DOS utility
to start up, and may not be easily accessible from Linux.  CD-ROMs,
sound cards, Ethernet cards and low-end tape drives can have this
problem.  If so, you may be able to work around this with an
argument to the boot prompt; see the Linux Boot Prompt HOWTO, <url
url="&howto;BootPrompt-HOWTO.html"> for
details).

<item> Some other operating systems will allow a bus mouse to share
an IRQ with other devices.  Linux doesn't support this; in fact,
trying it may lock up your machine.  If you are using a bus mouse,
see the Linux Bus Mouse HOWTO, <url
url="&howto;Busmouse-HOWTO.html">, for
details.
</itemize>

If possible, get the telephone number of an experienced Linux user
you can call in case of emergency.  Nine times out of ten you won't
need it, but it's comforting to have.

Budget time for installation.  That will be about one hour on
a bare system or one being converted to all-Linux operation.  Or
up to three hours for a dual-boot system (they have a much higher
incidence of false starts and hangups).

<sect1>Creating the boot and root floppies
<p>
(This step is only needed if you can't boot from a CD-ROM.)

Your Linux CD-ROM may come with installation aids that will take
you through the process of building boot, root, and rescue disks
with interactive prompts.  These may be an MS-DOS installation
program (such as the Red Hat <tt/redhat.exe/ program) or a Unix
script, or both.

If you have such a program and can use it, you should read the rest
of this subsection for information only.  Run the program to do
actual installation -- its authors certainly knew more about the
specific distribution than I, and you'll avoid many error-prone
hand-entry steps.

More detailed information on making bootdisks, see the
Linux Bootdisk HOWTO at <url
url="&howto;Bootdisk-HOWTO.html">.

Your first step will be to select a boot-disk image to fit your
hardware.  If you must do this by hand, you'll generally find that
either (a) the bootdisk images on your CD-ROM are named in a way
that will help you pick a correct one, or (b) there's an index
file nearby describing each image.

Next, you must create floppies from the bootdisk image you selected, and
optionally from the rescue disk images.  This is where the MS-DOS program
RAWRITE.EXE comes into play.

Next, you must have two or three <em/high-density/ MS-DOS formatted
floppies.  (They must be of the same type; that is, if your boot
floppy drive is a 3.5&dquot; drive, both floppies must be
high-density 3.5&dquot; disks.) You will use RAWRITE.EXE to
write the bootdisk images to the floppies.

Invoke it with no arguments, like this:

<tscreen>
C:&bsol;> RAWRITE
</tscreen>

Answer the prompts for the name of the file to write and the floppy
to write it to (such as <tt/A:/). RAWRITE will copy the file,
block-by-block, directly to the floppy. Also use RAWRITE for
the root disk image (such as COLOR144). When you're done,
you'll have two floppies: one containing the boot disk, the other
containing the root disk. Note that these two floppies will no
longer be readable by MS-DOS (they are ``Linux format'' floppies,
in some sense).

You can use the dd(1) commands on a UNIX system to do the same
job.  (For this, you will need a UNIX workstation with a floppy
drive, of course.)  For example, on a Sun workstation with the
floppy drive on device <em>/dev/rfd0</em>, you can use the command:

<tscreen><verb>
$ dd if=bare of=/dev/rfd0 obs=18k
</verb></tscreen>

You must provide the appropriate output block size argument (the `obs'
argument) on some workstations (e.g., Suns) or this will fail. If
you have problems the man page for dd(1) may be be instructive.

Be sure that you're using brand-new, error-free floppies. The
floppies must have no bad blocks on them.

Note that you do not need to be running Linux or MS-DOS in order to
install Linux.  However, running Linux or MS-DOS makes it easier to
create the boot and root floppies from your CD-ROM. If you don't
have an operating system on your machine, you can use someone
else's Linux or MS-DOS just to create the floppies, and install
from there.

<sect1>Repartitioning your DOS/Windows drives
<p>
On most used systems, the hard drive is already dedicated to
partitions for MS-DOS, OS/2, and so on.  You'll need to resize
these partitions in order to make space for Linux.  If you're going
to run a dual-boot system, it's strongly recommended that you read
one or more of the following mini-HOWTOS, which describe different
dual-boot configurations.

<itemize>
<item> The DOS-Win95-OS2-Linux mini-HOWTO, <url
url="&mini-howto;Linux+DOS+Win95+OS2.html">.

<item> The Linux+Win95 mini-HOWTO, <url
url="&mini-howto;Linux+Win95.html">

<item> The Linux+NT-Loader mini-HOWTO, <url
url="&mini-howto;Linux+NT-Loader.html">
</itemize>

Even if they are not directly applicable to your system, they will
help you understand the issues involved.

        <bf/NOTE:/ Some Linuxes will install to a directory on your MS-DOS
        partition. (This is different than installing FROM an MS-DOS 
        partition.) Instead, you use the ``UMSDOS filesystem'', which
        allows you to treat a directory of your MS-DOS partition as a Linux
        filesystem. In this way, you don't have to repartition your drive.

I only suggest using this method if your drive already has four
partitions (the maximum supported by DOS) and repartitioning would
be more trouble than it's worth (it slows down your Linux due to
filename translation overhead).  Or, if you want to try out Linux
before repartitioning, this is a good way to do so. But in most
cases you should re-partition, as described here. If you do plan to
use UMSDOS, you are on your own---it is not documented in detail
here. From now on, we assume that you are NOT using UMSDOS, and
that you will be repartitioning.

A <em/partition/ is just a section of the hard drive set aside for
a particular operating system to use. If you only have MS-DOS
installed, your hard drive probably has just one partition,
entirely for MS-DOS. To use Linux, however, you'll need to
repartition the drive, so that you have one partition for MS-DOS,
and one (or more) for Linux.

Partitions come in three flavors: <em/primary/, <em/extended/, and
<em/logical/.  Briefly, primary partitions are one of the four main
partitions on your drive. However, if you wish to have more than four
partitions per drive, you need to replace the last primary partition with
an extended partition, which can contain many logical partitions.  You
don't store data directly on an extended partition---it is used only as a
container for logical partitions. Data is stored only on either primary or
logical partitions.

To put this another way, most people use only primary partitions.
However, if you need more than four partitions on a drive, you
create an extended partition. Logical partitions are then created
on top of the extended partition, and there you have it---more than
four partitions per drive.

Note that you can easily install Linux on the second drive on your
system (known as <tt/D:/ to MS-DOS). You simply specify the
appropriate device name when creating Linux partitions. This is
described in detail below.

Back to repartitioning your drive: The problem with resizing
partitions is that there is no way to do it (easily) without
deleting the data on those partitions.  Therefore, you will need to
make a full backup of your system before repartitioning. In order
to resize a partition, we simply delete the partition(s), and
re-create them with smaller sizes.

<bf/NOTE:/ There is a non-destructive disk repartitioner available
for MS-DOS, called FIPS. Look at <url
url="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/install">. With FIPS, a
disk optimizer (such as Norton Speed Disk), and a little bit of
luck, you should be able to resize MS-DOS partitions without
destroying the data on them.  It's still suggested that you make a
full backup before attempting this.

If you're not using FIPS, however, the classic way to modify
partitions is with the program FDISK. For example, let's say
that you have an 80 meg hard drive, dedicated to MS-DOS. You'd like
to split it in half---40 megs for MS-DOS and 40 megs for Linux. In
order to do this, you run FDISK under MS-DOS, delete the 80
meg MS-DOS partition, and re-create a 40 meg MS-DOS partition in
its place. You can then format the new partition and reinstall your
MS-DOS software from backups. 40 megabytes of the drive is left
empty. Later, you create Linux partitions on the unused portion of
the drive.

In short, you should do the following to resize MS-DOS partitions
with FDISK:
<enum>
<item>Make a full backup of your system.
<item>Create an MS-DOS bootable floppy, using a command such as
<tscreen>
FORMAT /S A:
</tscreen>
<item>Copy the files <tt/FDISK.EXE/ and <tt/FORMAT.COM/ to this floppy,
as well as any other utilities that you need. (For example, utilities
to recover your system from backup.) 
<item> Boot the MS-DOS system floppy.
<item> Run FDISK, possibly specifying the drive to modify (such as
<tt/C:/ or <tt/D:/).
<item> Use the FDISK menu options to delete the partitions which
you wish to resize. <bf/This will destroy all data on the affected
partitions./
<item> Use the FDISK menu options to re-create those partitions,
with smaller sizes.
<item> Exit FDISK and re-format the new partitions with the
<tt/FORMAT/ command.
<item> Restore the original files from backup.
</enum>

Note that MS-DOS FDISK will give you an option to create
a ``logical DOS drive''. A logical DOS drive is just a logical
partition on your hard drive. You can install Linux on a logical
partition, but you don't want to create that logical partition
with MS-DOS fdisk. So, if you're currently using a logical
DOS drive, and want to install Linux in its place, you should
delete the logical drive with MS-DOS FDISK, and (later)
create a logical partition for Linux in its place.

The mechanism used to repartition for OS/2 and other operating 
systems is similar. See the documentation for those operating
systems for details.

<sect1>Creating partitions for Linux
<p>
After repartitioning your drive, you need to create partitions for
Linux. Before describing how to do that, we'll talk about
partitions and filesystems under Linux.

<sect2>Partition basics
<p>
Linux requires at least one partition, for the <em/root
filesystem/, which will hold the Linux kernel itself.

You can think of a <em/filesystem/ as a partition formatted for
Linux. Filesystems are used to hold files. Every system must have a
root filesystem, at least. However, many users prefer to use
multiple filesystems---one for each major part of the directory
tree. For example, you may wish to create a separate filesystem to
hold all files under the <em>/usr</em> directory.  (Note that on
UNIX systems, forward slashes are used to delimit directories, not
backslashes as with MS-DOS.) In this case you have both a root
filesystem, and a <em>/usr</em> filesystem.

Each filesystem requires its own partition. Therefore, if you're
using both root and <em>/usr</em> filesystems, you'll need to
create two Linux partitions. 

In addition, most users create a <em/swap partition/, which is used
for virtual RAM. If you have, say, 4 megabytes of memory on your
machine, and a 10-megabyte swap partition, as far as Linux is
concerned you have 14 megabytes of virtual memory.

When using swap space, Linux moves unused pages of memory out to
disk, allowing you to run more applications at once on your system.
However, because swapping is often slow, it's no replacement for
real physical RAM. But applications that require a great deal of
memory (such as the X window system) often rely on swap space if
you don't have enough physical RAM.

Nearly all Linux users employ a swap partition.  If you have 4
megabytes of RAM or less, a swap partition is required to install
the software. It is strongly recommended that you have a swap
partition anyway, unless you have a great amount of physical RAM.

The size of your swap partition depends on how much virtual memory
you need. It's often suggested that you have at least 16 megabytes
of virtual memory total. Therefore, if you have 8 megs of physical
RAM, you might want to create an 8-megabyte swap partition.  Note
that swap partitions can be no larger than 128 megabytes in
size. Therefore, if you need more than 128 megs of swap, you must
create multiple swap partitions. You may have up to 16 swap
partitions in all.

You can find more on the theory of swap space layout and
disk partitioning in the Linux Partition mini-HOWTO
(<url url="&mini-howto;Partition.html">).

Note: it is possible, though a bit tricky, to share swap partitions
between Linux and Windows 95 in a dual-boot system.  For details,
see the Linux Swap Space Mini-HOWTO, <url
url="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/unmaintained/mini/Swap-Space">.

Gotcha &num;1: If you have an EIDE drive with a partition that goes above
504MB, your BIOS may not allow you to boot to a Linux installed
there.  So keep your root partition below 504MB. This shouldn't be
a problem for SCSI drive controllers, which normally have their own
drive BIOS firmware.  For technical details, see the Large Disk
Mini-HOWTO, <url
url="&mini-howto;Large-Disk.html">.

Gotcha &num;2: Are you mixing IDE and SCSI drives?  Then watch out.
Your BIOS may not allow you to boot directly to a SCSI drive.

<sect2>Sizing partitions
<p>
Besides your root and swap partitions, you'll want to set up
one or more partitions to hold your software and home directories.

While, in theory, you could run everything off a single huge root
partition, almost nobody does this.  Having multiple partitions
has several advantages:

<itemize>
<item> It often cuts down the time required for boot-time file-system
checks.

<item> Files can't grow across partition boundaries.  Therefore
you can use partition boundaries as firebreaks against programs
(like Usenet news) that want to eat huge amounts of disk, to
prevent them from crowding out file space needed by your kernel
and the rest of your applications.

<item> If you ever develop a bad spot on your disk, formatting
and restoring a single partition is less painful than having to
redo everything from scratch.
</itemize>

On today's large disks, a good basic setup is to have a small root
partition (less than 80 meg), a medium-sized /usr partition (up to
300 meg or so) to hold system software, and a /home partition
occupying the rest of your available space for home directories.

You can get more elaborate.  If you know you're going to run
Usenet news, for example, you may want to give it a partition
of its own to control its maximum possible disk usage.  Or create
a /var partition for mail, news, and temporary files all together.  
But in today's regime of very cheap, very large hard disks these
complications seem less and less necessary for your first Linux
installation.  For your first time, especially, keep it simple.

Under Linux, several tools are available to edit partitions.  One probably
worth checking out is <url url="http://www.gnu.org/software/parted"
name="GNU parted">.  The documentation says it can resize partitions
without destroying the data on them, but proceed with care and make
backups anyway.

<sect1> Booting the installation disk
<p>
The first step is to boot the bootdisk you generated.  Normally
you'll be able to boot hands-off; the boot kernel prompt will fill
itself in after 10 seconds.  This is how you'll normally boot from
an IDE disk.

What's actually happening here is this: the boot disk provides a
miniature operating system which (because the hard drive isn't
prepared) uses a portion of your RAM as a virtual disk (called,
logically enough, a `ramdisk').

The boot disk loads onto the ramdisk a small set of files and
installation tools which you'll use to prepare your hard drive and
install a production Linux on it from your CD-ROM.

(In times past this was a two-stage-process, involving a second disk
called a `root disk'; this changed when kernel modules were introduced.)

By giving arguments after the kernel name, you can specify various
hardware parameters, such as your SCSI controller IRQ and address,
or drive geometry, before booting the Linux kernel.  This may be
necessary if Linux does not detect your SCSI controller or hard
drive geometry, for example.

In particular, many BIOS-less SCSI controllers require you to
specify the port address and IRQ at boot time. Likewise, IBM PS/1,
ThinkPad, and ValuePoint machines do not store drive geometry in
the CMOS, and you must specify it at boot time.  (Later on,
you'll be able to configure your production system to supply
such parameters itself.)

Watch the messages as the system boots. They will list and describe
the hardware your installation Linux detects.  In particular, if you
have a SCSI controller, you should see a listing of the SCSI hosts
detected.  If you see the message

<tscreen><verb>
SCSI: 0 hosts
</verb></tscreen>

Then your SCSI controller was not detected, and you will have to
figure out how to tell the kernel where it is.

Also, the system will display information on the drive partitions
and devices detected. If any of this information is incorrect or
missing, you will have to force hardware detection.

On the other hand, if all goes well and your hardware seems to be
detected, you can skip to the following section, ``Loading the
root disk.''

To force hardware detection, you must enter the appropriate
parameters at the boot prompt, using the following syntax:

<tscreen><verb>
linux <parameters...>
</verb></tscreen>

There are a number of such parameters available; we list some of
the most common below.  Modern Linux boot disks will often give
you the option to look at help screen describing kernel parameters
before you boot.

<itemize>
<item><em>hd=cylinders,heads,sectors</em> Specify the drive geometry.
Required for systems such as the IBM PS/1, ValuePoint, and ThinkPad.
For example, if your drive has 683 cylinders, 16 heads, and 32 sectors
per track, enter

<tscreen><verb>
linux hd=683,16,32
</verb></tscreen>

<item><em>tmc8xx=memaddr,irq</em> Specify address and IRQ for BIOS-less
Future Domain TMC-8xx SCSI controller. For example,

<tscreen><verb>
linux tmc8xx=0xca000,5
</verb></tscreen>

Note that the <em>0x</em> prefix must be used for all values given
in hex. This is true for all of the following options.

<item><em>st0x=memaddr,irq</em> Specify address and IRQ for
BIOS-less Seagate ST02 controller.

<item><em>t128=memaddr,irq</em> Specify address and IRQ for
BIOS-less Trantor T128B controller.

<item><em>ncr5380=port,irq,dma</em> Specify port, IRQ, and DMA
channel for generic NCR5380 controller.

<item><em>aha152x=port,irq,scsi_id,1</em> Specify port, IRQ, and
SCSI ID for BIOS-less AIC-6260 controllers. This includes Adaptec
1510, 152x, and Soundblaster-SCSI controllers.
</itemize>

If you have questions about these boot-time options, please read the
Linux <em>SCSI HOWTO</em>, which should be available on any Linux
FTP archive site (or from wherever you obtained this document). 
The <em>SCSI HOWTO</em> explains Linux SCSI compatibility in much
more detail.

<sect2> Choosing EGA or X installation
<p>
Older Linuxes (including Slackware) gave you a shell at this point
and required you to enter installation commands by hand in a
prescribed sequence.  This is still possible, but newer ones start
by running a screen-oriented installation program which tries to
interactively walk you through these steps, giving lots of help.

You will probably get the option to try to configure X right away
so the installation program can go graphical.  If you choose this
route, the installation program will quiz you about your mouse and
monitor type before getting to the installation proper.  Once you
get your production Linux installed, these settings will be saved
for you.  You will be able to tune your monitor's performance
later, so at this stage it makes sense to settle for a basic
640x480 SVGA mode.

X isn't necessary for installation, but (assuming you can get
past the mouse and monitor configuration) many people find the
graphical interface easier to use.  And you're going to want to
bring up X anyway, so trying it early makes some sense.

Just follow the prompts in the program.  It will take you through
the steps necessary to prepare your disk, create initial user
accounts, and install software packages off the CD-ROM.

In the following subsections we'll describe some of the tricky
areas in the installation sequence as if you were doing them
by hand.  This should help you understand what the installation
program is doing, and why.

<sect2>Using <tt/fdisk/ and <tt/cfdisk/
<p>
Your first installation step once the root-disk Linux is booted
will be to create or edit the partition tables on your disks.
Even if you used FDISK to set up partitions earlier, you'll
need to go back to the partition table now and insert some
Linux-specific information now.

To create or edit Linux partitions, we'll use the Linux version of
the <tt/fdisk/ program, or its screen-oriented sibling
<tt/cfdisk/.

Generally the installation program will look for a preexisting
partition table and offer to run <tt/fdisk/ or <tt/cfdisk/ on it
for you.  Of the two, <tt/cfdisk/ is definitely easier to use,
but current versions of it are also less tolerant of a nonexistent or
garbled partition table.

Therefore you may find (especially if you're installing on virgin 
hardware) that you need to start with <tt/fdisk/ to get to a state
that <tt/cfdisk/ can deal with.  Try running <tt/cfdisk/; if it
complains, run <tt/fdisk/.  (A good way to proceed if you're
building an all-Linux system and <tt/cfdisk/ complains is to use
<tt/fdisk/ to delete all the existing partions and then fire up
<tt/cfdisk/ to edit the empty table.)

A few notes apply to both <tt/fdisk/ and <tt/cfdisk/.  Both
take an argument which is the name of the drive that you wish to
create Linux partitions on. Hard drive device names are:

<itemize>
<item><em>/dev/hda</em> First IDE drive
<item><em>/dev/hdb</em> Second IDE drive
<item><em>/dev/sda</em> First SCSI drive
<item><em>/dev/sdb</em> Second SCSI drive
</itemize>

For example, to create Linux partitions on the first SCSI drive in
your system, you will use (or your installation program might
generate from a menu choice) the command:

<tscreen>
cfdisk /dev/sda
</tscreen>

If you use <tt/fdisk/ or <tt/cfdisk/ without an argument, it will
assume <em>/dev/hda</em>.

To create Linux partitions on the second drive on your system,
simply specify either <em>/dev/hdb</em> (for IDE drives)
or <em>/dev/sdb</em> (for SCSI drives)
when running <tt/fdisk/.

Your Linux partitions don't all have to be on the same drive.  You
might want to create your root filesystem partition on
<em>/dev/hda</em> and your swap partition on <em>/dev/hdb</em>, for
example. In order to do so just run <tt/fdisk/ or <tt/cfdisk/ once
for each drive.

In Linux, partitions are given a name based on the drive which
they belong to. For example, the first partition on 
the drive <em>/dev/hda</em> is <em>/dev/hda1</em>, the second is 
<em>/dev/hda2</em>, and so on. If you have any logical partitions,
they are numbered starting with <em>/dev/hda5</em>, 
<em>/dev/hda6</em> and so on up.

<bf/NOTE:/ You should not create or delete partitions for operating
systems other than Linux with Linux <tt/fdisk/ or <tt/cfdisk/. That
is, don't create or delete MS-DOS partitions with this version of
<tt/fdisk/; use MS-DOS's version of <tt/FDISK/ instead. If you try
to create MS-DOS partitions with Linux <tt/fdisk/, chances are
MS-DOS will not recognize the partition and not boot correctly.

Here's an example of using <tt/fdisk/. Here, we have a single
MS-DOS partition using 61693 blocks on the drive, and the rest of
the drive is free for Linux. (Under Linux, one block is 1024
bytes. Therefore, 61693 blocks is about 61 megabytes.)  We will
create just two partitions in this tutorial example, swap and root.
You should probably extend this to four Linux partitions in line
with the recommendations above: one for swap, one for the root
filesystem, one for system software, and a home directory area.

First, we use the ``<tt/p/'' command to display the current partition 
table.  As you can see, <em>/dev/hda1</em> (the first partition 
on <em>/dev/hda</em>) is a DOS partition of 61693 blocks. 
<tscreen><verb>
Command (m for help):   p
Disk /dev/hda: 16 heads, 38 sectors, 683 cylinders 
Units = cylinders of 608 * 512 bytes

     Device Boot  Begin   Start     End  Blocks   Id  System
  /dev/hda1   *       1       1     203   61693    6  DOS 16-bit >=32M

Command (m for help):
</verb></tscreen>

Next, we use the ``<tt/n/'' command to create a new partition. The
Linux root partition will be 80 megs in size.

<tscreen><verb>
Command (m for help):  n 
Command action 
    e   extended 
    p   primary partition (1-4)
p
</verb></tscreen>

  Here we're being asked if we want to create an extended or
primary partition. In most cases you want to use primary
partitions, unless you need more than four partitions on a
drive. See the section ``Repartitioning'', above, for more
information.

<tscreen><verb>
Partition number (1-4): 2
First cylinder (204-683):  204
Last cylinder or +size or +sizeM or +sizeK (204-683): +80M
</verb></tscreen>

The first cylinder should be the cylinder AFTER where the last
partition left off. In this case, <em>/dev/hda1</em> ended on 
cylinder 203, so we start the new partition at cylinder 204.

As you can see, if we use the notation ``<tt/+80M/'', it specifies a
partition of 80 megs in size. Likewise, the notation ``<tt/+80K/'' 
would specify an 80 kilobyte partition, and ``<tt/+80/'' would 
specify just an 80 byte partition.

<tscreen><verb>
Warning: Linux cannot currently use 33090 sectors of this partition
</verb></tscreen>

If you see this warning, you can ignore it. It is left over from an
old restriction that Linux filesystems could only be 64 megs in
size. However, with newer filesystem types, that is no longer the
case... partitions can now be up to 4 terabytes in size. 

Next, we create our 10 megabyte swap partition, <em>/dev/hda3</em>.

<tscreen><verb>
Command (m for help): n
Command action 
    e   extended 
    p   primary partition (1-4) 
p

Partition number (1-4): 3
First cylinder (474-683):  474
Last cylinder or +size or +sizeM or +sizeK (474-683):  +10M
</verb></tscreen>

Again, we display the contents of the partition table. Be
sure to write down the information here, especially the size of 
each partition in blocks. You need this information later.

<tscreen><verb>
Command (m for help): p
Disk /dev/hda: 16 heads, 38 sectors, 683 cylinders 
Units = cylinders of 608 * 512 bytes

     Device Boot  Begin   Start     End  Blocks   Id  System
  /dev/hda1   *       1       1     203   61693    6  DOS 16-bit >=32M
  /dev/hda2         204     204     473   82080   83  Linux native
  /dev/hda3         474     474     507   10336   83  Linux native
</verb></tscreen>

Note that the Linux swap partition (here, <em>/dev/hda3</em>) has type 
``Linux native''. We need to change the type of the swap partition to 
``Linux swap'' so that the installation program will recognize it
as such. In order to do this, use the <tt/fdisk/ ``<tt/t/'' command:

<tscreen><verb>
Command (m for help): t
Partition number (1-4): 3
Hex code (type L to list codes): 82
</verb></tscreen>

If you use ``<tt/L/'' to list the type codes, you'll find that 
82 is the type corresponding to Linux swap.

To quit <tt/fdisk/ and save the changes to the partition table, use the
``<tt/w/'' command. To quit <tt/fdisk/ WITHOUT saving changes, 
use the ``<tt/q/'' command. 

After quitting <tt/fdisk/, the system may tell you to reboot to
make sure that the changes took effect. In general there is no reason
to reboot after using <tt/fdisk/---modern versions of <tt/fdisk/
and <tt/cfdisk/ are smart enough to update the partitions
without rebooting.

<sect2> Post-partition steps
<p>
After you've edited the partition tables, your installation program
should look at them and offer to enable your swap partition for
you.  Tell it yes.

(This is made a question, rather than done automatically, on the off
chance that you're running a dual-boot system and one of your
non-Linux partitions might happen to look like a swap volume.)

Next the program will ask you to associate Linux filesystem names
(such as /, /usr, /var, /tmp, /home, /home2, etc.) with each of the
non-swap partitions you're going to use.

There is only one hard and fast rule for this.  There must be a
root filesystem, named /, and it must be bootable.  You can name
your other Linux partitions anything you like.  But there are some
conventions about how to name them which will probably simplify
your life later on.

Earlier on I recommended a basic three-partition setup including a
small root, a medium-sized system-software partition, and a large
home-directory partition.  Traditionally, these would be called /,
/usr, and /home.  The counterintuitive `/usr' name is a historical
carryover from the days when (much smaller) Unix systems carried
system software and user home directories on a single non-root
partition.  Some software depends on it.

If you have more than one home-directory area, it's conventional
to name them /home, /home2, /home3, etc.  This may come up if you
have two physical disks.  On my personal system, for example, the
layout currently looks like this:

<tscreen><verb>
Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
/dev/sda1              30719   22337     6796     77%   /
/dev/sda3             595663  327608   237284     58%   /usr
/dev/sda4            1371370    1174  1299336      0%   /home
/dev/sdb1            1000949  643108   306130     68%   /home2
</verb></tscreen>

The second disk (sdb1) isn't really all /home2; the swap
partitions on sda and sdb aren't shown in this display.
But you can see that /home is the large free area on sda
and /home2 is the user area of sdb.

If you want to create an partition for scratch, spool, temporary,
mail, and news files, call it /var.  Otherwise you'll probably
want to create a /usr/var and create a symbolic link named
/var that points back to it (the installation program may
offer to do this for you).

<sect1>Installing software packages
<p>
Once you've gotten past preparing your partitions, the remainder of
the installation should be almost automatic.  Your installation
program (whether EGA or X-based) will guide you through a series of
menus which allow you to specify the CD-ROM to install from, the
partitions to use, and so forth.

Here we're not going to document many of the specifics of this
stage of installation.  It's one of the parts that varies most
between Linux distributions (vendors traditionally compete to add
value here), but also the simplest part.  And the installation
programs are pretty much self-explanatory, with good on-screen
help.

<sect1>After package installations
<p>
After installation is complete, and if all goes well, the
installation program will walk you through a few options 
for configuring your system before its first boot from hard drive.

<sect2>LILO, the LInux LOader
<p>
LILO (which stands for LInux LOader) is a program that will allow
you to boot Linux (as well as other operating systems, such as
MS-DOS) from your hard drive.

You may be given the option of installing LILO on your hard drive.
Unless you're running OS/2, answer `yes'.  OS/2 has special
requirements; see <ref id="custom-LILO" name="Custom LILO
Configuration"> below.

Installing LILO as your primary loader makes a separate boot
diskette unnecessary; instead, you can tell LILO at each boot time
which OS to boot.

<sect2>Making a production boot disk (optional)
<p>
You may also be given the chance to create a ``standard boot
disk'', which you can use to boot your newly-installed Linux
system.  (This is an older and slightly less convenient method
which assumes that you will normally boot DOS, but use the boot
disk to start Linux.)

For this you will need a blank, high-density MS-DOS formatted
diskette of the type that you boot with on your system. Simply
insert the disk when prompted and a boot diskette will be created.
(This is not the same as an installation bootdisk, and you can't
substitute one for the other!)

<sect2>Miscellaneous system configuration
<p>
The post-installation procedure may also take you through several
menu items allowing you to configure your system. This includes
specifying your modem and mouse device, as well as your time
zone.  Follow the menu options.

It may also prompt you to create user accounts or put a password
on the root (administration) account.  This is not complicated
and you can usually just walk through the screen instructions.

<sect>Booting Your New System
<p>
If everything went as planned, you should now be able to boot Linux
from the hard drive using LILO.  Alternatively, you should be able
to boot your Linux boot floppy (not the original bootdisk floppy,
but the floppy created after installing the software).  After
booting, login as <em/root/. Congratulations! You have your very
own Linux system.

If you are booting using LILO, try holding down <em/shift/ or
<em/control/ during boot. This will present you with a 
boot prompt; press <em/tab/ to see a list of options. In this
way you can boot Linux, MS-DOS, or whatever directly from LILO.

<sect>After Your First Boot
<p>
You should now be looking at the login prompt of a new Linux,
just booted from your hard drive.  Congratulations!

<sect1>Beginning System Administratration
<p>
Depending on how the installation phase went, you may need to
create accounts, change your hostname, or (re)configure X at this
stage.  There are many more things you could set up and configure,
including backup devices, SLIP/PPP links to an Internet Service
Provider, etc.

A good book on UNIX systems administration should help. (I suggest
<em/Essential Systems Administration/ from O'Reilly and
Associates.)  You will pick these things up as time goes by. You
should read various other Linux HOWTOs, such as the
<em/NET-3-HOWTO/ and <em/Printing-HOWTO/, for information on other
configuration tasks.

<sect1>Custom LILO Configuration<label id="custom-LILO">
<p>
LILO is a boot loader, which can be used to select either Linux,
MS-DOS, or some other operating system at boot time.  Chances are
your distribution automatically configured LILO for you during the
installation phase (unless you're using OS/2, this is what you
should have done).  If so, you can skip the rest of this section.

If you installed LILO as the <em/primary/ boot loader, it will
handle the first-stage booting process for all operating systems on
your drive. This works well if MS-DOS is the only other operating
system that you have installed. However, you might be running OS/2,
which has its own Boot Manager. In this case, you want OS/2's Boot
Manager to be the primary boot loader, and use LILO just to boot
Linux (as the <em/secondary/ boot loader).

An important gotcha for people using EIDE systems: due to a BIOS
limitation, your boot sectors for any OS have to live on one of the
first two physical disks.  Otherwise LILO will hang after writing
"LI", no matter where you run it from.

If you have to configure LILO manually, this will involve editing
the file <em>/etc/lilo.conf</em>. Below we present an example of a
LILO configuration file, where the Linux root partition is on
<em>/dev/hda2</em>, and MS-DOS is installed on <em>/dev/hdb1</em>
(on the second hard drive).

<tscreen><verb>
# Tell LILO to install itself as the primary boot loader on /dev/hda.

  vga = ask            # Prompt for VGA mode
  append = "aha152x=0x340,11,7,1"  # Add this to the boot options,
   # for detecting the SCSI controller

# The stanza for booting MS-DOS
other = /dev/hdb1      # This is the MS-DOS partition
  label = msdos        # Give it the name "msdos"
  table = /dev/hdb     # The partition table for the second drive
</verb></tscreen>

Once you have edited the <em>/etc/lilo.conf</em> file, run
<em>/sbin/lilo</em> as <em>root</em>. This will install LILO on
your drive. Note that you must rerun <em>/sbin/lilo</em> anytime
that you recompile your kernel in order to point the boot loader at
it properly (something that you don't need to worry about just now,
but keep it in mind).

Note how we use the <em>append</em> option in
<em>/etc/lilo.conf</em> to specify boot parameters as we did when
booting the bootdisk.

You can now reboot your system from the hard drive. By default LILO
will boot the operating system listed first in the configuration
file, which in this case is Linux. In order to bring up a boot
menu, in order to select another operating system, hold down
<em>shift</em> or <em/ctrl/ while the system boots; you should see
a prompt such as
<tscreen>
Boot:
</tscreen>
Here, enter either the name of the operating system to boot (given
by the <em>label</em> line in the configuration file; in this case,
either <em>linux</em> or <em>msdos</em>), or press <em/tab/ to get
a list.

Now let's say that you want to use LILO as the secondary boot
loader; if you want to boot Linux from OS/2's Boot Manager, for
example.  In order to boot a Linux partition from OS/2 Boot
Manager, unfortunately, you must create the partition using OS/2's
<em>FDISK</em> (not Linux's), and format the partition as FAT or
HPFS, so that OS/2 knows about it.  (That's IBM for you.)

In order to have LILO boot Linux from OS/2 Boot Manager, you only
want to install LILO on your Linux root filesystem (in the above
example, <em>/dev/hda2</em>). In this case, your LILO config file
should look something like:

<tscreen><verb>
boot = /dev/hda2
install = /boot/boot.b
compact

image = /vmlinuz
  label = linux
  root = /dev/hda2
  vga = ask
</verb></tscreen>

Note the change in the <em/boot/ line. After running
<em>/sbin/lilo</em> you should be able to add the Linux partition
to Boot Manager. This mechanism should work for boot loaders used
by other operating systems as well.
