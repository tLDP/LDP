<sect> Introduction
<p> 
This article gives information about how to cast videos to big screen TV (Television)
from Linux desktop computer and also from your mobile phones.
View videos, pictures, and play music on your Linux computer by projecting to a
big screen TV (Television).
Linux can cast the video, audio, pictures to TV (television screen) using DLNA.
DLNA stands for 
<bf>Digital Living Network Alliance</bf>
, the trade group founded by Sony in 2003 to define the interoperability 
guidelines that make this communication possible between Linux computer
and TV.

To use DLNA on your TV, you need to connect both, your TV and your 
smartphone or tablet to the same 
<bf>network</bf>. You can do this on both <bf>devices</bf> by 
going into their <bf>Network</bf> 
settings and searching for your wireless network. 
Select your home wireless network from this list and enter 
your WiFi network password.

A modern AV receiver that supports DLNA can stream movies, music, 
and digital photos 
from a storage device attached to your home network to your smart TV. 
All DLNA-certified devices use Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) to discover 
and talk to each other on the network.

<sect> MiniDLNA
<p>
DLNA is the only non-proprietary media serving technology and has decent device support. 
MiniDLNA is the most popular open source DLNA server.

ReadyMedia 
<url url="http://minidlna.sourceforge.net">
(formerly known as MiniDLNA) is a simple media server software, with 
the aim of being fully compliant with DLNA/UPnP-AV clients. 
It is developed by a NETGEAR employee for the ReadyNAS product line.

Download ReadyMedia which has the latest code as compared with MiniDLNA.
And it is same.

Install the older MiniDLNA (use ReadyMedia instead)
<tscreen><code>
$ sudo apt-get update
$ apt-cache search minidlna
$ sudo apt-get -y install minidlna
</code></tscreen>

Edit /etc/minidlna.conf: 
<tscreen><code>

# chown -R minidlna.minidlna /var/lib/minidlna
# chmod a+r videos/*
$ sudo service minidlna force-reload
</code></tscreen>

Switch on the TV (Television) and using the TV Remote press "Sources" button and you should see "Desktop-Linux"
on the TV screen
along with other sources like TV, Cable, DVD, Antenna. Select "Dekstop-Linux" and click Videos folder
and then you should see the same files as in your linux computer. Pick one video file and play on TV.

<sect> Streaming Video from Linux to TV set
<p>

<bf>Method 1:</bf>

Websites like YouTube support the casting from Linux desktop PC to TV sets.

<bf>IMPORTANT:</bf> Before you attempt below steps, you MUST power on 
your Television (TV) set and the TV must be
connected to your local WiFi router or by ethernet wire to router.
Also the Linux desktop PC must be connected to the same router which connects TV.

Also must be running the DLNA service on Linux PC (see previous section).

In Linux desktop, open web browser Google Chrome and open YouTube 
<url url="http://youtube.com">. 
And you will see the Cast icon at bottom right corner (rectangle with waves).
This Cast icon in Linux web browser will show ONLY when your TV set is powered ON.
Click on the cast icon and select the DLNA destination source to the TV set.
On your TV screen, you will see a popup dialog which says Allow/Deny video.
Using the TV remote pick Allow and now the TV screen will start playing the video.
If you do not see the popup dialog you may want to keep clicking twice or reload 
the webbrowser and retry again. Sometimes, the TV plays video without any popup.

Firefox browser currently does not support casting youtube out of the box.
If you are using the Firefox browser,  then you will need a Add-on like MagicCast
<url url="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/magic-cast/">.
Install MagicCast add-on to firefox browser and then you have to set the
Device ID. 
Click on Firefox:Menu:Add-ons:Extensions:MagicCast:Preferences:Settings:Enter Device ID

You should find out the Device ID displayed when you connect Mag setup box to TV.
Note this device ID of setup box and enter this above.

To use MagicCast, you need AuraHD or MAG set-top box and browser Chrome or Firefox.
By installing the MAGic Cast extension in the browser and specifying the 
unique identifier of your set-top box in it, you will be able to send 
almost any video to the set-top box and watch it on the big screen.
The MAGic Cast extension button turns blue if the page has a video to send. 
Click on the extension button and the video link will be sent to all 
the devices specified in the extension.

This does not work for TV, to support TV, someone needs to enhance 
this magic-cast add-on to 
add support for smart TVs like Samsung and others devices.

<bf>Method 2:</bf>

Download the "Command line Video downloader" package 

youtube-dl
<url url="http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html">
, is a popular command line tool for downloading videos from YouTube and other similar websites.

<tscreen><code>
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install youtube-dl
</code></tscreen>


Change directory to where the minidlna videos directory is, one which is visible on TV screen.
$ cd /var/lib/minidlna/videos
$ youtube-dl http://VIDEO_URL

Now you can play the video downloaded on TV screen.

Other option is to download the video with web-browser plugins like Video-downloader.
It can download video to linux box and using DLNA (see previous chapters) you can then
play video.

<sect> Mobile phone
<p>
To stream content from your smartphone, 
you need to have a DLNA app 
installed on it. One of the most popular DLNA apps is BubbleUPnP, which 
can be downloaded from the Google Play Store for free. Some 
smartphones also come with pre-loaded DLNA apps.

Or instead of BubbleUPnp, you can use the Youtube or chrome browser which has Cast icon.

<sect1> UPnP
<p>
UPnP (which stands for Universal Plug and Play) is a feature that 
allows the devices on your home network to discover each other and 
access certain services. Often, this is used for streaming media 
between devices on a network.

<url url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UPnP_AV_media_servers_and_clients">

<sect1>Using YouTube or Chrome webbrowser to cast
<p>

On phone open Youtube and open a video. 
Power on the TV.
At the bottom right corner you will see Cast Icon (rectangle with waves)
Click it and select the TV name and play.


<sect1>Selecting a device
<p>

Once you have the BubbleUPnP app loaded on your smartphone, you are 
presented with a screen with four menus at the bottom - Now Playing, 
Playlist, Library and Devices. Before you select a file, you need to 
select a device that you want to stream to. You can access this list 
by clicking on Devices, present on the main screen of the app. 
Select your TV from the list of renderers. If you are streaming 
content from your handheld device, then you can select this too. 
If you have a separate network storage drive, you can choose to 
stream from it too.

<sect1>Streaming media content to TV
<p>

Once you select the device, you need to select the content you want to 
play on it. You can access all your media by selecting first the 
source from where you want to play. BubbleUPnP segregates all your songs, 
videos and images into folders. You can click on the file you want to 
stream. Once you select the file, the app will start streaming it on to 
your TV. You can either select one file or create a playlist of your 
preference. You can also control the volume of the TV, with the help of 
the volume keys present on your phone. Skipping through the video or 
song is also possible. You can also use DLNA to stream photos to the TV. 
Some Smart TVs do not even need a router as a medium to stream media 
files from a smartphone. To do this, you need to have a smart TV and 
a smartphone that support Miracast. This technology uses Wi-Fi Direct 
to stream content and is great for use in short distances such as in 
a living room.  Miracast also allows you to duplicate your smartphone 
screen on to your smart TV. This means, you can play movies, music 
and also play games and use apps on the large screen.
