<title>IPMasquerading+Napster mini-HOWTO
<author>John E. Danner
<date>v1.6, 11 April 2000</date>

<abstract>This mini-HOWTO present a way to allow users behind an IPMasq'd system to use Napster.
</abstract>
<p>For information about Napster, please see their website at
<url url="http://www.napster.com/" name="Napster Homepage">
</p>

<sect>DISCLAIMER
<p>In order to allow Napster to work correctly, you will need to put a hole in the IP Masq'd system. This inherently presents potential security problems. Unfortunately I cannot accept responsibility for this hack. So if you do this, and you get burned because of it...not my fault. Great...now lets get into it...
</p>

<sect>INTRODUCTION
<p>After setting up a network for my roommates and I, the problem arose that were not able to use Napster because of the IPMasquerading I was doing. So I put some time into and came up with this solution to the problem. I hope it works for you like it did for me...but I can't promise anything.
</p>

<sect>BEFORE YOU BEGIN
<p>
I have tested this solution with the following variables:

<enum>
<item>Napster v2.0 Beta 5a (for Windows), visit 
<url url="http://www.napster.com/" name="Napster Homepage">
 to ensure you have the newest version.
</item>
<item>One external IP to the internet.
</item>
<item>Currently 6 systems behind the IPMasq'd machine, 4 using Napster.
</item>
<item>Using Linux kernel version 2.2.12-20 (RedHat v6.1 Distribution)
</item>
<item>IPMASQADM utility version 0.42, get it
<url url="http://juanjox.kernelnotes.org/" name="Here">
</item>
</enum>
</p>

<sect>PROCEDURE
<p>First off, ensure that you have the version (or newer) as listed above in the previous section. Also be sure they are installed correctly.

<enum>
<item>Install Napster on the Windows client PC's
</item>
<item>After installation and Napster user setup, this version of Napster will begin "Finding Acceptable Local Data Port", after a short time an error will occur.
Note: If you have already installed napster v2.0 beta 5a, under the file menu select 'Properties.'
</item>
<item>At this point select the second option "I am not behind a firewall or I configured my firewall - Use TCP port:"
</item>
<item>Enter a unique number. Each computer that will be running Napster will need to use a different port. It may be easier to use the last number of the IP address. For example: if the computer's IP is 192.168.1.2, then 6702 would be easiest to remember. 
Note: make sure you don't pick ports for services that are running (i.e. 21, 110, etc...see /etc/services for a listing)
</item>
<item>Repeats steps 1 - 4 for all systems that will be using Napster.
</item>
<item>Now login to your IPMasq'd system and modify a startup file of your choice (I choose to use /etc/rc.d/rc.local)
<verb>
The following lines pass the connection to the Napster clients running on the hosts behind your IPMasq'd system.
(add them to the startup file - you'll need to one command for each host using Napster)

/usr/sbin/ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 6702 -R 192.168.1.2 6702
/usr/sbin/ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 6703 -R 192.168.1.3 6703
/usr/sbin/ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 6704 -R 192.168.1.4 6704
/usr/sbin/ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 6705 -R 192.168.1.5 6705

Note: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX is the IP address of the Linux IPMasqing system (the Internet IP).
</verb>
Note: If you are having problems with IPMASQADM or IPMasquerading in general see the IPMASQ-HOWTO. This document is provided to help people who have their systems configured. The IPMASQ-HOWTO will get into a deeper discussion of port forwarding and IPMasq'd in general.
</enum>

<sect>DYNAMIC IP AREA (Dial-up or DHCP)
<p>See this and the Procedure section if your IP address changes everytime you connect to the internet.

Thanks to Peter Illmayer for the following submission to me:
(This will work out best for those of you with dynamic IP's...)
<verb>
------------------------------------------------------------
IN debian, I created a forward file in /etc/ppp/ip-up.d and put in

#!/bin/sh
ppp_ip="`/sbin/ifconfig ppp0 | grep 'inet addr' | awk '{print $2}' | sed -e
's/.*://'`"
/usr/sbin/ipmasqadm portfw -f
/usr/sbin/ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L ${ppp_ip} 6702 -R 192.168.0.2 6702

This is in a 2.2.x kernel with ipmasqadm installed with the appropriate
kernel modules compiled in.
---------------------------------------------------------------
</verb>
Charles J. Fisher pointed out that a similar script can be used 
if you are using DHCP, insert the following lines in a script that runs after you get your IP address.
<verb>
net_ip="`ifconfig eth0 | awk '/inet/ {sub(/addr:/,"",$2); print $2}'`"
/usr/sbin/ipmasqadm portfw -f
/usr/sbin/ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L ${net_ip} 6702 -R 192.168.1.2 6702
</verb>
Of course the more machines using Napster behind your IPMasq'd machine the more port forwards you need to do.
</p>

<sect>FINISHED PRODUCT
<p>This system will allow Napster to operate properly behind an IPMasq'd system.
Hopefully it works for you as well as it does for me! Please direct comments/suggestions/flames to   jed204@psu.edu

<sect>HOWTO MAINTENANCE
<p>
This is the initial version of this document. Very rough. If the interest is out there and things changes, so will this document. If anyone else has a solution they think is better...please, all means, let me know and we can discuss what the best solution possible is.
