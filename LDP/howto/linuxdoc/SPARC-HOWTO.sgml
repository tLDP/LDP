<abstract>
The SPARC family of microprocessors is a very good implementation 
of the RISC design and SPARC based computing devices cover a very wide
spectrum of applications, from mainframe class computers to radhard
microprocessors used by the aerospace industry in its space segment.

SPARC based computers are usually very well engineered products,
thus Linux on SPARC is a 
winning combination both in performance and ease of use. Actually 
this combination is not as widspread as the Linux/x86; this HOWTO
should help you step by step to make an informed decision: try it you will not
regret it.

<sect>Preface.
<p>
This document is a step by step guide meant to 
provide information in order 
to help you running Linux on SPARC based computers,
As these computers are quite different from PCs 
an  hardware section will provide you with the needed information in
order to understand how they work and what can be expected from the
various CPUs and models.
<p>
I am not a SPARC specialist, nor a Solaris or Linux guru, I am just
someone who is realy found of well engineered products, and  wish to
help you in choosing your hardware and finding information. Thus I
have tried to write down this document in order to ease your path.
<p> 
I hope this HOWTO will help you and you will have a lot of fun
with your SPARC Computer.

<sect>SPARC, which one ?
<p>
This document deals only with SPARC based 
computers, in order to check, just
type <tt>uname -m</tt> command and you should read
something like <tt>sparc4x</tt> where x is blank,c,d,m,u
if the system runs Solaris, or <tt>sparc</tt> for 32 bits SPARC architectures
and <tt>sparc64</tt> for 64 bits SPARC architectures if it runs Linux.
2.x.y

<p>

SPARC stands for Scalable Processor ARChitecture,
 it derives from research done between 1984-1988 
on the  RISC architecture at UC Berkeley.
It exists 3 versions of this archiecture, SPARC-V7, SPARC-V8 
(32 bits) and SPARC-V9 (64 bits).
As you  are likely to encounter a lot of implementations of
the SPARC architecture, in the next section,  the main features
of theses processors are summarized.

<sect1>Sun SPARC
<p>
This is quite obsolete, it is an implementation of the 
SPARC-V7 ; its main feature are an Integer unit (IU), an external Floating Point Unit (FPU),
an unified data + instruction 64KB direct associative cache, and an Memory Managment Unit (MMU).
There is a 4 stage pipeline for the integer instructions 
(fetch F, decode D, exec E, update WB)
FPU and IU are synchronized.

<sect1>Super SPARC
<p>
This is Texas Instrument and Sun's brainchild, it is usualy found at around 50Mhz clok rates
featuring up to 1MB of L2 cache, it is available both as single and dual processor modules 
(SparcStation 10 and SparcStation 20). The higher clock frequency I
have encountered so far is 60Mhz.
<p>
On a technical point of view this is a SPARC-V8 implementation,
it is a superscalar processor,
having 2 caches, one for instruction the other one for data. 
<itemize>
<item>The 20kB instruction cache is a 5 way associative.
<item>The 16KB data cache is 4 way associative. 
</itemize>

<sect1>Micro SPARC
<p>
This is once again Texas Instrument and Sun's brainchild, it can be found
 in the SparcStation Classic, SparcStation LX, at frequency up to
50Mhz. Its derivative, the Micro SPARC II can be found in the SparcStation
4 and SparcStation 5 at frequencies up to 110Mhz.
<p>
On a technical point of view, its main features are a high level of
integration, having 2 caches, one for instructions, the other one for
data.

<itemize>
<item>A 4KB instruction direct associative cache.
<item>A 2KB data direct associative cache.
</itemize> 

It is not possible to add an L2 cache.
If you wish to learn more about the MicroSPARC processor you can browse
Sun's 
<htmlurl
url="http://www.sun.com/processors/index.html"
name=" Ultra SPARC"> ressources. 

<sect1>Hyper SPARC
<p>
This processor was introduced by ROSS in 1993, it is usualy found in the 
SparcStation 10, and SparcStation 20, at frequencies up to 150Mhz 
(I have heard of 200Mhz dual processor modules, but Have not
witnessed one yet). It can be found on single or dual
processor modules.
<p> 
On a technical point of view it is an implementation of the SPARC-V8,
 it is superscalar. It can be found with L2 cache up to 512KB

<sect1>ERC32
<p>
This is a radhard SPARC V7 microprocessor designed to be used on the
space segment.
<p>
It comes as a single unit or as a three chip 
package. Main manufacturer is  <tt>ATMEL</tt> in Nantes,
France. At least, one software vendor claims to have GNU/Linux running
on this CPU, this is for the 

<htmlurl
url="http://dse.cyberclwn.com/sparc-rtems-erc32.htm"
name="http://dse.cyberclwn.com/sparc-rtems-erc32.htm">. This project
has not been updated since March 2001. As I have not had the
opportunity to check this claim. I am more than doubtful.

<sect1>LEON
<p>
This is also a radhard implementation of the SPARC V8 designed to be
used on the space segment. It is the ESA's brainchild and the lead
designer is jiri gaisler. 
More information can be found on LEON's website:

<p>
The 2.4 and 2.5 kernel series are not yet supported, however the 2.0 kernel
series is supported by the <tt>uClinux</tt> MMU less
GNU/Linux distribution. 
This distribution has been built at ESA/ESTEC December 26 2003
 on a SuSE 8.0 GNU/Linux distribution
with gcc version 2.95.3 20010315 and a 2.4.18 kernel.
Hereafter is the boot sequence and a sample session inside the
 tsim-leon simulator.

<sect1>Ultra SPARC
<p>
The Ultra SPARC processor is an extension of the SPARC-V9
architecture, it is a 64 bits processor, it features some video
processing instructions. It is found in all the computer whose name
start with Ultra.
<p>
The Ultra SPARC II is an improvement of the Ultra SPARC, the 
Ultra SPARCIII is actually the second generation of Ultra SPARC
processors, it was first introduced in the SunBlade 1000 Workstation.
If wish to learn more about the UltraSPARC processors you can browse
Sun's

<sect1>SPARC64 V
<p>

This processor is based on the SPARC V9 and is made by Fujitsu
It is a 64bits CPU with some very interesting error handling features such as
ECC memory for
 the L1 cache, hardware instruction retry, error classification.
<p>
There is a 64 bit virtual address space and 43 bit physical address space. 
It is used in the PRIMEPOWER high end servers to mainframe class of Fujitsu's 
offering.
 <p>
The cache is organized as :
<itemize>
<item>A 128kB 2 way associative L1 instruction cache
<item>A 128kB 2 way associative L1 data cache
<item>A 2MB unified 4 way associative L2 cache
</itemize>

name="CPU-Design-HOWTO">, this HOWTO has a lot of interesting links
when it comes to studying the CPUs.
<p>
To summarize, the 32 bits workstations are the:
<itemize>
<item>
The sun4 workstation is the 
 sun4/330 model.
<item>
The sun4c workstations are the
SparcStation 1,2, IPC and IPX models.
<item>
The sun4m workstations are the 
 SparcStation 5, 10 and 20. 
</itemize>
Only the SparcStation 10 and SparcStation 20 are SMP
capable: up to 2 CPU modules.

For more information on the SparcStation 5, 10, 20
you can read Sun's
<htmlurl 
url="http://docs.sun.com/"
name=" documentation ">online or download it available.
<p>
The following model have an 64 bits UltraSPARC
architecture (sun4u).
SunUltra 1, 2, 5, 10, 30, 60, 80 and SunBlade 1000, 1500, 2000.
The SunUltra 2, 60, 80 and SunBlade 1000 are SMP capable, 
with the Ultra 80 and SunBlade 1000 and 2000 accepting up to 4 CPU modules, 
the SunUltra 2 and 60 accepting only 2 CPU modules.
<p>
The SunBlade 2000 is the latest one featuring Sun's latest marvel
the Ultra III CPU, at a premium price of course.
You can have a summary of the UltraWorkstation still in production

<p>
A lot of information has been compiled in 
the

<sect1>Deciphering the CPUs
<p>
At first, a reference like SM61 or RT-200-D-125/512 seems 
to be, to say the least, quite cryptic.
Actually, understanding theses references is really easy.

<sect2>Ross Technology.
<p>
Theses CPUs's naming scheme is <tt>RT-a00-b-freq/cache</tt>
where 
<itemize>
<item><tt>a</tt> is a digit:
 <itemize>
   <item><tt>1</tt> SparcStation 10.
   <item><tt>2</tt> SparcStation 20.
   <item><tt>6</tt> SPARC MP600 ( not exactly a workstation ).
 </itemize>
<item><tt>b</tt> is a letter:
 <itemize>
   <item><tt>D</tt> Dual CPU.
   <item><tt>Q</tt> Quad CPU.
   <item><tt>S</tt> Single CPU.
 </itemize>
<item><tt>freq</tt> The frequency expressed in Megahertz.
<item><tt>cache</tt> The amount of cache memory expressed in Kilobytes.
</itemize>

When these modules are in a workstation the naming convention is 
HSxy, for example <tt>ywing</tt> is a SparcStation 20 HS22,
thus it is easier to have a look inside the workstation.
<sect2>SM modules.

Warning: the <tt>SM100</tt> is a <tt>RT-600-D-40</tt>
<p>

<sect2>Cypress.
<p>
Cypress manufactured SPARC compliants processors;
AFAIK their naming scheme is CYnnn. 

As you can see, this is easy to understand.

<sect1>The javastation.
<p>
This is a family of Network computers that used to be manufactured by Sun,
there is a very good 
<htmlurl url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/JavaStation-HOWTO/"
name="JavaStation-HOWTO"> about it.
 
<sect>Buying a SPARC computer.
<p>
 
You have decided to buy a SPARC based computer, now you 
can tell what CPU each model sports, but can you tell how that
particuliar model looks like? How its is inside? 
<p>
Do not worry, this section will help you on that topic as well as 
providing you with some hints on how to inspect and test the hardware. 

<sect1>Gaigning a visual familiarity with SPARC hardware
<p> 
PC hardware is everywhere and usualy one is quite 
familiar with it, this is not exactly the case with SPARC based hardware,
even more when it comes to the innards of a computer. The good news
is that it exists some sites on the web, where you can find pictures
of Sun hardware, with some very detailed shots, thus you should be
able to instantly identify the model and its condition prior to buy it.
The two main site where I usualy go are:
<itemize>
<item> <htmlurl url="http://www.sun.com/"
name="sun ">In Sun's database, you can find technical data as well as 
picture of some of Sun's product, the pictures are crisp, and the
hardware is always at its best, this is technicaly interesting, in
order to compare brand new hardware and the used one that is usualy 
featured on the two sites below.
<item> <htmlurl
url="http://www.black-cube.net/Sun/"
name="HAL"> This site features very detailed pictures of a lot of
hardware, from CPU modules to Servers, even mice. 
<item><htmlurl
url="http://www.obsolyte.com/sunPICS/"
name="obsolyte"> This site has different pictures, it is very useful too.
</itemize>

<sect1>Sun made hardware or clones ?
<p>
On the one hand, it is very easy to find information on Sun hardware, while it can be
difficult to find it for clone systems on the other hand it should be
more fun to work with exotic hardware.
<p>
Clone systems have been or are still manufactured, at least by:
<itemize>
<item>Fujitsu.
<item>Toshiba
<item>Ross
<item>Tadpole/RDI manufactures SPARC based laptops.
<item><htmlurl
url="http://www.tsti.com"
name="Tatung"> is still in the market and sells SBus, PCI cards, and
of course systems up to the UltraSPARC III based 2U and 4U servers.
For more information about tatung's COMPServer and COMPStations, please read
the Tatung's Workstations and Servers sections of this document.

<item>Toshiba, used to manufacture SPARC based laptops:
The AS1000.

</itemize>
<sect1>Where to buy.
<p>
Of course if you buy first hand hardware everything should be fine, 
but if you decide to go for second hand hardware, you will have to
decide how you want to buy it, and you should be able to test it by yourself.
<p>
Second hand hardware can be brought from Sun as 
refurbished hardware, at auction websites, or in
specialised stores, or directly from companys that upgrade their
hardware.

<sect1>Checklist
<p>
When it comes to second hand hardware one has to be as cautious as
possible about the source, and the condition  of that hardware.
<p>
For the source of the hardware, if you can track it, it is a very good
point. If you can't track it, it is up to you to decide if you trust
the seller or not ( If the seller cannot give you the reference of the
hardwre and if, obviously he/she is clueless about Sun hardware, you
should switch to condition red ).
<p>
Another interesting point is to see if check is accepted as a
payement.
<p>
If you can check the hardware before buying it
then first have a general look at it, search for
cracks, for stains; check the connector's pin. If this first
inspection is OK, then ask to see the inside, look for spills, watch
carefuly the connectors, then if it is OK ask to see it running, 
watch carefully boot messages, issue the <tt>dmesg|more</tt> 
or if it runs Solaris you can issue the <tt>more /var/adm/messages</tt> command,
and also very important listen to your computer, do you hear unusual 
noises? Does it smell OK?. Then enter the OpenBoot by the
<tt>stop+a</tt> command and run some tests ( see the OpenBoot section
).
When you have decided to purchase it, it is very important that you
always make sure that the computer you are purchasing is the one
you have tested: always keep an eye on it, do not let someone go to
the backoffice with it for example, do not accept to leave without
your computer.
<p>
Then, when you are at home, recheck it as if it was the first time you
see it. 
If it comes with CDROM drive, try to mount/umount a few CDs 
and read them in order to check that device. If there is a floppy disk
read/write/format a few floppys, this should be a good test.


<p>
Of course, it exists tools to automaticaly test the hardware, but 
usualy you do not have them when you need them, thus the script
below relies only on ressources provided by a Linux base system.
<p>

You should run the following script for three days, basicaly it
is going to use the CDROM, floppy and hard drive, and to reboot 
the computer every 3 hours. This should stress it, 


<code>
#
# Enter this in the crontab(5)
# run the torture.sh script every 3 hours if possible
#
0 */3 * * * /root/torture.sh
</code>
Where <tt>torture.sh</tt> is 
<code>
#!/bin/sh

# 
# these are for controlling the loops
# the CDLIMITS and FDLIMITS
# are for the CD and FD loops
# 
CPT=1
CDLIMIT=3
FDLIMIT=10

#
# to which devices are
# CDROM and floppy attached
#
CDROM=/dev/sr0
FLOPPY=/dev/fd0

#
# where is the program we
# intend to compile

PATH=/path_to_big_package_to_compile

#
# this section is meant to 
# test the CDROM and floppy drives
# comment what you do not need to
# test

while [ $CPT -le $CDLIMIT ]
do
 #
 # CDROM drive
 #
 
 mount -rt iso9660 $CDROM /cdrom
 find /cdrom -exec cat {} \; >>/dev/null 2>&1
 umount /cdrom
 CPT=$(($CPT+1))
done
 
 #
 # floppy drive
 #
CPT=1
while [ $CPT -le $FDLIMIT ]
do
 mke2fs -c $FLOPPY >/dev/null 2>&1
 mount -t ext2 $FLOPPY /floppy
 cd /bin/
 cp dd ps echo sh /floppy
 find /floppy -exec cat {} \; >>/dev/null 2>&1 
 umount /floppy
 CPT=$(($CPT+1))
done


#
# The big, intensive 
# compilation
# 

cd $PATH

# 
# now compile
#
make


# 
#
# we remove every .a .o .s and every executable
#

find $PATH -name "*.[aos]" -exec rm -f {} \; >/dev/null 2>&1
find $PATH -exec test -x {} \; -exec rm -f {} \; >/dev/null 2>&1

#
# time to reboot
#
reboot 

</code>

Of course you should run this script manualy once in order to know how
much time it requires to complete, this is just an idea on how to
automate things.

<sect>SPARC based laptops
<p>

There exists SPARC based, laptops.

They are not very widespread but, they are actually very good SPARC workstations. 
<itemize>
<item>SparcBook 1:
<item>SparcBook 2:
<item>Tadpole SparcBook 3GX: 
This is a 100Mhz MicroSPARC II (TI) with a Weitek P9100 frame buffer and a screen resolution of 800x600.
GNU/Linux runs on it 
The PCMCIA, internal modem and power management are not supported at the time 
of this writing.

<sect>The wonderful SparcStation Voyager
<p>

Nearly ten years ago in 1994, Sun microsystems introduced the SPARCStation
Voyager 
(ss240).
This computer was a Sun4m architecture, powered by a microSPARC II processor.
It is a very compact computer, behing a hybrid between a desktop and a Laptop.
It has the footprint of a very compact workstation with a builtin color LCD
display, PCMCIA and InfraRed ports with a 2"5 SCSI harddrive.
I have seen one at the CCC in Berlin, runing Debian GNU/Linux but the InfraRed and 
PCMCIA ports are not supported.
Its datasheet is actually very impressive:

<itemize>
<item>60 Mhz microSPARC
<item>up to 80MB RAM
<item>up to 810MB fast SCSI 2 Harddrive
<item>5.5 by 14.5 footprint
<item>12" 1024x768x8 color LCD or 14" monochrome or 14" 
display in 1152x900
<item>Ethernet 10 																								    display
<item>storage temperature -25C to 60C
<item>operating temperature 0C to 40C

</itemize>

<sect>Installing Linux
<p>

To install Linux on a SPARC based computer, should be strightforward
if you follow the informations provided by your distribution.
<p>
To boot from a floppy drive you have to have an install image on a
floppy disk and to issue the <tt>boot floppy</tt> from the OpenBoot.
<p>
If your computer does not have a CDROM or a floppy drive, you can always try 
to perform a network installation using <tt>NFS</tt> as explained by 
this French document: 
<htmlurl
url="http://www.linux-france.org/article/materiel/sparc-install/Sparc-netinstall.html"
name="http://www.linux-france.org/article/materiel/sparc-install/Sparc-netinstall.html">
. Basicaly, you have to set up an <tt>NFS</tt> server and to boot your
computer using the 
<tt>boot net vmlinux nfsroot=192.168.52.12:/tmp</tt>
in order to access the image that is exported by the 
<tt>192.168.52.12</tt> computer on the <tt>/tmp</tt> directory.
Another source of information, this one is written in English,
 is this FAQ from the UltraLinux website (
<htmlurl
url="http://www.ultralinux.org/faq.html#q_5_9"
name="http://www.ultralinux.org/faq.html#q_5_9">
)

<sect>Working with the Openboot.
<p>
In this section, you will be given an overview of what is the OpenBoot,
and
you will be given the main commands you need to know in order to test
your hardware and to install Linux.
<sect1>What is the OpenBoot?
<p>

If you are used to PC hardware, you are used to interact with 
its BIOS. SPARC computers have an Openboot, it may seem to be like 
your BIOS, but it is actually far more powerfull. 
The Openboot performs the following tasks:
<itemize>
<item>Testing and initializing the hardware.
<item>Starting the operating System.
<item>Giving you acces to a set of tools to program and to debug it.
</itemize>
The programming language is FCode, if you can program the Forth
langage, you can program it.
<p>
In this section, we will juste use a small set of the OpenBoot's 
capabilities, in order to test hardware and to boot the system.
First you have to enter in the OpenBoot, just hit the <tt>stop</tt>
and <tt>a</tt> keys simultaneously. Then you should see a <tt>ok</tt>
prompt, if instead you see the <tt>&gt;</tt> prompt then type
<tt>n</tt>. Now you can proceed to the next section.
  
<sect1>Diagnostics commands.
<p>
The OpenBoot, gives you a lot of commands to test 
and to gather information about your hardware.
<itemize>

<item><tt>.version</tt> Displays version and date of the startup PROM.
<item><tt>banner</tt> You will see the banner, that is displayed at
power-on. It is useful to gather some data about CPUs.
<item><tt>pcia-probe-list</tt> Test PCI on computers that have a PCI bus.
<item><tt>module-info</tt> This will display the Buses clockspeed,
and processors frequency and amount of cache. 
<item><tt>probe-scsi</tt> This will test all devices connected to the on board
SCSI controler. 
<item><tt>probe-scsi-all</tt> This will test all devices connected to all
the SCSI controlers.
<item><tt>show-devs</tt> This displays all installed and probed devices.
<item><tt>show-sbus</tt> Use this, if you just want to display a list of
installed and probed SBus devices.

<item><tt>test-all</tt> This will test all devices in the
system that have a self test program.
<item><tt>test floppy</tt> If a floppy drive is installed, it will test it
reminding you to have a formated floppy disk inside.
<item><tt>test-memory</tt> If the system <tt>diag-switch?</tt> is set to 
<tt>true</tt>, this will test the memory.
<item><tt>test net</tt> This will test the network interfaces 
<item><tt>watch-aui</tt> This will test the AUI ethernet link.
You will see '.' for good packets and 'X" for bad ones. Strike any key 
to abort.
<item><tt>watch-clock</tt> This will test the real time clock chip, it
will tick once a second. To stop this test strike any key.
<item><tt>watch-net</tt> This will check the network connection ( both
AUI and TP ). You will see '.' for good packets and 'X" for bad
ones. Strike any key to abort.
<item><tt>watch-net-all</tt> This will test all Ethernet interfaces.
You will see '.' for good packets and 'X" for bad ones. Strike any key 
to abort. When you abort one, it will test the next one.
<item><tt>watch-tpe</tt> This will check the TPE ethernet interface.
You will see '.' for good packets and 'X" for bad ones. Strike any key 
to abort.
</itemize> 

<sect1>Boot commands.
<p>
The OpenBoot allows you to boot from various devices, the command
you are the more likely to enter are below.
<itemize>
<item><tt>boot</tt> Boot kernel from default device.
<item><tt>boot cdrom</tt> Boot kernel from CDROM drive.
<item><tt>boot net-tpe</tt> Boot kernel from network urnel from CDROM drive, this is the
command you are the more likely to type when installing Linux.
<item><tt>boot net</tt> Boot kernel from network using auto-selected
interface.
<item><tt>boot net-aui</tt> Boot kernel from network using AUI
interface.
<item><tt>boot net-tpe</tt> Boot kernel from network using TPE
interface.
<item><tt>boot tape</tt> Boot default file from tape.
</itemize>


<sect1>Misc commands.
<p>

<itemize>
<item><tt>eject-floppy</tt> Ejects the floppy.
<item><tt>power-off</tt> Poweroff the computer.
</itemize>
You can  poweroff your computer, when you are working with the 
OpenBoot : just type <tt>power-off</tt>

For more informations on the OpenBoot you can read this FAQ at
<htmlurl 
url="http://www.itworld.com/AppDev/616/UIR951001openboot/" 
name="http://www.itworld.com/AppDev/616/UIR951001openboot/">
<sect>Hard drive buses.
<p>
Depending on their architecture, the computers are likely to feature
one of the following hard drive buses.

<sect1>SCSI-SCA.
<p>
An SCSI connector is located at the rear of the Computer; 
the SCA chanel is found on the internal bus of the SPARC Worstation. It
can be basicaly seen as an SCSI bus that provides power supply and
assigns SCSI ID to the peripherals.

<sect1>EIDE.
<p>
This is found for example in an Ultra 5 or Ultra 10 computers
This bus is the one you can find in your intel box.

<sect1>FC-AL
<p>
This is the FiberChannel bus.
It is used by the SunBlade 1000 workstation.

<sect>CDROM: specific settings.
<p>
The easiest way to install linux on SPARC computer is to use a
CDROM. If your computer does not have a CDROM you can plug an
external SCSI CDROM drive, but there are two things to do or you
are doomed to fail: 
<itemize>
<item>When you issue the <tt>boot cdrom</tt> command, the CDROM is
mapped to ID number 6.
<item>Your CDROM player's block size should be setted up on 512.
</itemize>
As a rule of thumb, nearly all SCSI CDROM drives can be assigned to ID number 
6 but you should check if the block size setting can be changed. 


<sect>SILO.
<p>
The Sparc Improved Boot LOader ( SILO ), is the boot loader that is
used in the SPARC architecture. It allows you to boot Linux, Solaris
or SunOS. It can load a Linux kernel from ext2, iso9660, UFS or 
ROMFS. From the SILO's README:
<p>
 This is the first attempt at a complete boot loader for Linux
on the Sparc.  Because of the lack of space on the bootblock, we have
to do it in two steps, the first step is a very simple loader based on
Peter Zaitcev's silo (we will call this the first stage loader) which
should fit in 512B and its sole purpose is to load a more
complete bootstrap loader, herein refered to as the second stage boot
loader. The cool thing about the second stage loader we implemented is
that it makes use of the ext2 library (provided with the ext2fs tools) and
some ufs code, and thus allows the loader to access any file on a ext2 fs
and ufs, uses silo.conf, handles gunzipping and a lot of other things.
This is different from Linux/i386 lilo which needs a map for each
kernel. In silo we just keep one map file for the second stage
loader, we don't expect you to be changing the second stage loader on
your daily routine (you can do so, you will just need to use a tool to
reinstall the maps).
<p>
Actually, IMHO it is easier to use than LILO.

<sect>Compiling a kernel

<p>
If you have already compiled a kernel on x86 architecture
there is just a little difference when you wish to compile 
a kernel on SPARC architecture.
<p>
you do not type 
<code>
#make zImage
#make modules
#make modules_install
</code>
but
<code>
#make vmlinux
#make modules
#make modules_install
</code>
More information can be found on
<htmlurl
url="http://www.ultralinux.org/faq.html"
name="http://www.ultralinux.org/faq.html " >
Then, from the Ultralinux's FAQ the following steps are :
<itemize>
<item>1.Copy <tt>linux/System.map</tt> to your bootfile directory (eg. <tt>/boot</tt>), and rename this file to <code>System.map-<kernel-version></code>
<item>2.Copy <tt>linux/vmlinux</tt> to your bootfile directory, and rename this file to <code>vmlinux-<kernel-version></code>
<item>3.Edit <tt>/etc/silo.conf</tt>, and add your new kernel to this file.</item>
<item>4.Reboot your machine.</item>
</itemize>
<p>
If you have trouble compiling your kernel, maybe it needs to be
pached. There are many patches floating around on the net. There
exists a website that put some of them online on a regular basis both
for the stable and unstable branches, up to the 2.6.x kernel series. 
Those patches apply to the
hardware used by the site's owner and this should be considered as a
very good starting point to be adapted to your hardware.
More information can be found at
<htmlurl
url="http://osinvestor.com/sparc/"
name="http://osinvestor.com/sparc/">
 You can also email the site's owner, Rob Radez :
<htmlurl
url="mailto:rob@osinvestor.com"
name="&lt;rob@osinvestor.com&gt;">
If you are unfamiliar with paches he also made them available as
debian packages.



<sect>Keyboard and mouse.
<p>
Most of the sun4m workstation have a special connector for the
keyboard. In this case the mouse is connected indifferently to 
left or the right side of the keyboard. Some computers have a 
PS2 connector, it is very easy to spot the difference. 
The keyboards you are the more likely to encounter are the type4 and type5. 
</p>
<p> 
At the time of this writting, I didn't manage to have mouse support
on the Sun Blade 100. Things should become easier in the near future.
 
<sect>X Window.
<p>

<tt>XFree</tt>, usually, runs fine on theses systems.
The table below helps you choose the XFree86 4.2.0 server that matches your
graphic adapter:

<code> 
Graphic Adapter		Xserver

Sun Creator 3D		sunffb
Sun Elite 3D		sunffb
Sun GX			suncg6
Sun Leo (ZX)            sunleo
Sun TCX			suntcx
Sun Turbo GX		suncg6
Sun bw2			sunbw2
Sun cg14		suncg14
Sun cg3			suncg3
</code>

There is a catch with the  13W3 video connector that equips some 
of the framebuffers you may encounter.
One may try to plug it on a VGA monitor using an 13W3 to VGA adaptor that
is sold on the market. The problem is that SGI and Sun Microsystems do
not have the same definition of this standard and depending of the adapter
you buy, this may work or not (you know Murphy ...). As a rule, idealy you should
try it before you buy. 

<sect>SMP.
<p>

Ouaich, SMP is supported, and I am sure that ROSS's dual CPU 
modules are supported as you can see by yourself:

<code>

piou@ywing:~ > cat /proc/cpuinfo 
cpu             : ROSS HyperSparc RT625 or RT626

piou@ywing:~ > 

</code>

<p>
The SparcStation 10 and SparcStations 20 are SMP capable computers and
 according to the
<htmlurl
url="http://faqaboss.sunhelp.org/"
name="FAQABOSS" >
the following combinations are known to work :
<itemize>
<item>2xSM40 ( model 402 )
<item>2xSM41 ( model 412 )
<item>2xSM51 ( model 512 )
<item>2xSM512 ( model 514 )
<item>2xSM61 ( model 612 )
<item>2xSM71 ( model 712 )
<item>2xSM81 ( model 812 )
</itemize>

And, as stated earlier, CPU modules in SparcStations 10 and can run a
different clock speeds, the following ones __SHOULD__ work:

<itemize>
<item>2xSM50
<item>SM41, SM51
<item>SM41, SM61
<item>SM51, SM61
<item>SM71, SM81
</itemize>



<p>
How does it performs? Well, it is fast, really fast. Some of the java 
Demos can run faster on a dual HyperSparc 125Mhz 128MB ( <tt>ywing</tt> ) than on a dual 
celeron BP6 433@433Mhz 192MB ( <tt>calimero</tt> ). The same applies for the Gimp. When it
comes to compiling <tt>calimero</tt> runs faster than <tt>ywing</tt>. Both computers
running 2.2.16 kernel and <tt>calimero</tt>'s hard disk subsystem is full SCSI.
<p>
One important detail when you plan to have different CPU modules in
your computer is to have the same kind of modules, you cannot mix
SuperSparc and HyperSparc for example, but you can have an odd number
of CPUs, for example 3. They are said to be able to run modules
at different clock speed as written in this article form
<htmlurl
url="http://www.aceshardware.com/Spades/read.php?article_id=76"
name="AcesHardware">
, but I have not witnessed it.  

<tt>ywing</tt> has been upgraded to quad-CPU. You can read the
kernel's message:

So I have performed an empirical <tt>proftpd</tt> compilation test using the
<tt>make  -JN</tt>. The results are:
<code>
with make
real    3m27.466s
user    3m15.670s
sys     0m12.030s

with make -j2

real    1m52.670s
user    3m27.210s
sys     0m15.310s

with make -j3

real    1m22.560s
user    3m43.910s
sys     0m18.070s

with make -j4
real    1m13.582s
user    4m2.200s
sys     0m22.830s

with make -j5
real    1m13.445s
user    4m4.060s
sys     0m22.640s

with make -j8

real    1m15.550s
user    4m1.840s
sys     0m22.960s

with make -j 10
real    1m20.091s
user    4m2.440s
sys     0m22.170s

</code>

As expected the best results are with make -j5 ( one instance per CPU +
one ready to enter when a cache miss occurs ); then N increasing the results
are starting to worsen.

As a conclusion, those <tt>sun4m</tt> SMP systems will be very
interesting when Gimp 2.0 will be available because of multitreading
 and paralelization of algorithms.

If you want to learn more about SMP and Linux you can read the
<tt>SMP-HOWTO</tt>

name="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SMP-HOWTO.html">

<sect>The sound.
<p>
The sound works fine on my SparcStation 20 and a 2.4.x kernel series.
Most of the people I know report succes with the 2.4 kernel series.

<p>
If you plan to use an older kernel, 
you can read the Linux/Sparc audio webpage at
<htmlurl
url="http://www.dementia.org/~shadow/sparcaudio.html"
name="sparcaudio"> which 
 is a very good source of information about Sound support on Sun's
SparcStations. 
 
<sect>Serial port.
<p>
Sun workstations ususaly have 2 serial ports, but 
on sun4m workstation there is usualy only one serial connector at the rear,
you need a special Y cable in order to have access to both ports.

<sect>Thanks and Credits.
<p>

<sect1>Thanks.
<p>

Among the many people who showed me how great Unix and the Unix
computers can be, some people have earned a special place
 I would like to thank them:

<itemize>
<item>My &quot;Vieux matou&quot; Michel Fiolet. Who gave me my first acount
on a real Unix machine, and took the time to answer my questions,
showing me among other things how to take advantage of the hardware's
feature.
<item>Nathalie Sabbah. Who was always able to guess at the speed of light
 what went wrong and fixed it on the fly. And took time to install the
tools I needed.
<item>Yves Daignaux. Who among other things always welcomed my questions, and
whose office was always open even late in the evening.
</itemize> 
Both of them beeing real Sysadmin and teachers
 from the trenches, have a very
deep knowledge and understanding of both the Hardware and Software.
<p>
Also many thanks to &quot;old crocodile&quot; virgile for the time he spent at
the library helping me to get the big picture. 

<sect1>Credits.
<p>

Some people gave a lot of time and ressource to help me
with this project, hereafeter is their names sorted by alphabetic
order:
