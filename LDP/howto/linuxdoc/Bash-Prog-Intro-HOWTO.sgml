    <abstract> 
    This article intends to help you to start programming 
    basic-intermediate shell scripts. It does not intend to be an 
    advanced document (see the title). I am NOT an expert nor guru 
    shell programmer. I decided to write this because I'll learn a 
    lot and it might be useful to other people. Any feedback will be apreciated, 
    specially in the patch form :)

     Requisites
          <P> Familiarity with GNU/Linux command lines, and familiarity 
          with basic programming concepts is helpful. While this is not
          a programming introduction, it explains (or at least tries) many
          basic concepts.

	      <item> You have an idea about programming and you want to start 
	      coding some shell scripts.
	      <item> You have a vague idea about shell programming and want 
	      some sort of reference.
	      <item> You want to see some shell scripts and some comments to
	      start writing your own
	      <item> You are migrating from DOS/Windows (or already did) 
	      and want to make "batch" processes.

Very simple Scripts

    <P> This HOW-TO will try to give you some hints about shell script
    programming strongly based on examples.
    <P> In this section you'll find some little scripts which 
    will hopefully help you to understand some techniques.

    <sect1>
    Traditional hello world script

        <!-- __TO-DO__
	someone suggested using this instead of the line numbering 
	but it doesn't work on verion 1.0.9
	<pre></pre> 
	-->
	<P>
	<tscreen><verb>
	  #!/bin/bash          
	  echo Hello World!    
	</verb></tscreen>
	<P> 
	<P> This script has only two lines. 
        The first indicates the system which program 
        to use to run the file. 
        <P> The second line is the only action performed by this script, 
        which prints 'Hello World! on the terminal.
    </sect1>
    <sect1>
    A very simple backup script
        <P>
	<tscreen><verb>
	#!/bin/bash          
	tar -cZf /var/my-backup.tgz /home/me/
	</verb></tscreen>
        <P> In this script, instead of printing a message on the terminal, 
	we create a tar-ball of a user's home directory. This is NOT intended
	to be used, a more useful backup script is presented later in this 
        document.
    </sect1>

<!-- Redirection -->
<sect>
All about redirection

	<sect1>
	Theory and quick reference
	<p> There are 3 file descriptors, stdin, stdout and stderr (std=standar)

	<p>Basically you can:
	<enum>
	<item> redirect stdout to a file
	<item> redirect stderr to a file
	<item> redirect stdout to a stderr 
	<item> redirect stderr to a stdout 
	<item> redirect stderr and stdout to a file 
	<item> redirect stderr and stdout to stdout 
	<item> redirect stderr and stdout to stderr
	</enum>
	1 'represents' stdout and 2 stderr
	<p> A little note for seeing this things: with the less command you can view both stdout 
	(which will remain on the buffer) and the stderr that will be printed on the screen, but erased as 
	you try to 'browse' the buffer. 
	</sect1>
	
	<sect1>
	Sample: stdout 2 file 
	<p> This will cause the ouput of a program to be writen to a file
	<tscreen><verb>
	ls -l > ls-l.txt
	</verb></tscreen>
	Here, a file called 'ls-l.txt' will be created and it will contain what you would see on the 
	screen if you type the command 'ls -l' and execute it.
	</sect1>

	<sect1>
	Sample: stderr 2 file 
	<p> This will cause the stderr ouput of a program to be writen to a file
	<tscreen><verb>
	grep da * 2> grep-errors.txt
	</verb></tscreen>
	Here, a file called 'grep-errors.txt' will be created and it will contain what you would see
	the stderr portion of the output of the 'grep da *' command.
	</sect1>

	<sect1>
	Sample: stdout 2 stderr
	<p> This will cause the stderr ouput of a program to be writen to the same filedescriptor 
	than stdout.
	<tscreen><verb>
	grep da * 1>&2 
	</verb></tscreen>
	Here, the stdout portion of the command is sent to stderr, you may notice that in differen ways.
	</sect1>

	<sect1>
	Sample: stderr 2 stdout 
	<p> This will cause the stderr ouput of a program to be writen to the same filedescriptor 
	than stdout.
	<tscreen><verb>
	grep * 2>&1
	</verb></tscreen>
	Here, the stderr portion of the command is sent to stdout, if you pipe to less, you'll see that
	lines that normally 'dissapear' (as they are written to stderr) are being kept now (because
	they're on stdout). 
	</sect1>

	<sect1>
	Sample: stderr and stdout 2 file 
	<p> This will place every output of a program to a file. This is suitable sometimes 
	for cron entries, if you want a command to pass in absolute silence.  
	<tscreen><verb>
	rm -f $(find / -name core) &> /dev/null 
	</verb></tscreen>
	This (thinking on the cron entry) will delete every file called 'core' in any directory. Notice
	 that you should be pretty sure of what a command is doing if you are going to wipe it's output.

<!-- pipes -->
<sect>
Pipes
	<p> This section explains in a very simple and practical way how to use pipes, 
	nd why you may want it.

	<sect1>
	What they are and why you'll want to use them
		<p> Pipes let you use (very simple, I insist) the output of a program as the 
		input of another one	
	</sect1>


	<sect1>
	Sample: simple pipe with sed 
	<p> This is very simple way to use pipes.
	<tscreen><verb>
	ls -l | sed -e "s/[aeio]/u/g"	
	</verb></tscreen>
	Here, the following happens: first the command ls -l is executed, and it's output, 
	instead of being printed, is sent (piped) to the sed program, which in turn, prints
	what it has to. 
	</sect1>

	<sect1>
	Sample: an alternative to ls -l *.txt 
	<p> Probably, this is a more difficult way to do ls -l *.txt, but it is here for illustrating pipes,
	not for solving such listing dilema. 
	<tscreen><verb>
	ls -l | grep "\.txt$"
	</verb></tscreen>
	Here, the output of the program ls -l is sent to the grep program, which, in turn, will print 
	lines which match the regex "\.txt$".
	</sect1>

<!-- Variables -->
<sect>
Variables

    <!-- Dry Theory -->
        <P> You can use variables as in any programming languages. 
	There are no data types. A variable in bash can contain a number, a
	character, a string of characters. 
	<P>  You have no need to declare a variable, just 
        assigning a value to its reference will create it.


    <!-- Samples -->
        <sect1>
	Sample: Hello World! using variables
            <P> 
	    <tscreen><verb>
	    #!/bin/bash          
	    STR="Hello World!"
	    echo $STR    
	    </verb></tscreen>

	    <P> Line 2 creates 
	    a variable called STR and assigns the string "Hello World!" to
	    it. Then the VALUE of this variable is retrieved by putting 
	    the '$' in at the beginning. Please notice (try it!) 
	    that if you don't use the '$' sign, the output of the program will
	    be different, and probably not what you want it to be.
	</sect1>
        <sect1>
	   Sample: A very simple backup script (little bit better)
	   <P> 
	   <tscreen><verb>
	   #!/bin/bash          
	   OF=/var/my-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tgz
	   tar -cZf $OF /home/me/
	   </verb></tscreen>
	   <P> This script introduces another thing. First 
	   of all, you should be familiarized with the variable 
	   creation and assignation on line 2. Notice the expression
	   '$(date +%Y%m%d)'.
	   If you run the script you'll notice that 
	   it runs the
	   command inside the parenthesis, capturing its output. 

	   <P> Notice that in this script, the output filename will
	   be different 
	   every day, due to the format switch to the date command(+%Y%m%d).
	   You can change this by specifying a different format.
	   <P> Some more examples:
	   <P> echo ls
	   <P> echo $(ls)
	</sect1>   
</sect>

<!-- Conditionals -->
<sect>
Conditionals
    
    <P> Conditionals let you decide whether to perform an action 
    or not, this decision is taken by evaluating an expression.

    <!-- Dry Theory -->
    <sect1>
    Dry Theory
        <P> Conditionals have many forms. The most basic form is:
	<bf/if/ <it/expression/ <bf/then/ <it/statement/
	where 'statement' is only executed if 'expression' 	
	evaluates to true.
	'2<1' is an expresion that evaluates to false, while '2>1' 
	evaluates to true.xs
	<P> Conditionals have other forms such as:
	<bf/if/ <it/expression/ 
	<bf/then/ <it/statement1/ <bf/else/ <it/statement2/.
	 Here 'statement1' is executed  if 'expression' is true,otherwise
	'statement2' is executed.
	<P> Yet another form of conditionals is:  
	<bf/if/ <it/expression1/ 
	<bf/then/ <it/statement1/ 
	<bf/else if/ <it/expression2/ <bf/then/ <it/statement2/ 
	<bf/else/ <it/statement3/.
	In this form there's added only the
	"ELSE IF 'expression2' THEN 'statement2'" which makes statement2 being
	executed if expression2 evaluates to true. The rest is as you may 
	imagine (see previous forms).
	<P> A word about syntax:
	<P> The base for the 'if' constructions in bash is this:
	<P> if [expression];
	<P> then
	<P>    code if 'expression' is true.
	<P> fi
    </sect1>
    <!-- Samples -->
        <sect1>
	Sample: Basic conditional example if .. then
            <P> 
	    <tscreen><verb>
	    #!/bin/bash
	    if [ "foo" = "foo" ]; then
	       echo expression evaluated as true
	    fi
	    </verb></tscreen>
	    <P> The code to be executed if the expression within braces 
	    is true can 
	    be found after the 'then' word and before 'fi' which indicates the end 
	    of the conditionally executed code.
	</sect1>
	<sect1>
	Sample: Basic conditional example if .. then ... else
	    <P>
	    <tscreen><verb>
	    #!/bin/bash
	    if [ "foo" = "foo" ]; then
	       echo expression evaluated as true
	    else
	       echo expression evaluated as false
	    fi

	    T1="foo"
	    T2="bar"
	    if [ $T1 = $T2 ]; then
	        echo expression evaluated as true

<!-- Loops : for, while and until -->
<sect>
Loops for, while and until
    <!-- Dry Theory -->

    <P> In this section you'll find for, while and until loops.
    <P> The <bf/for/ loop is a little bit different from other programming
    languages. Basically, it let's you iterate over a series of 
    'words' within a string.
      <P> The <bf/while/ executes a piece of code if the control expression
      is true, and only stops when it is false (or a explicit break is found
      within the executed code.
      <P> The <bf/until/ loop is almost equal to the while loop, except that
      the code is executed while the control expression evaluates to false.
      <P> If you suspect that while and until are very similar you are right.
    <!-- Samples -->    
    <sect1>
    For sample
        <P> 
	<tscreen><verb>
        #!/bin/bash
        for i in $( ls ); do
            echo item: $i
        done
        </verb></tscreen>
        <p> 
        <p> On the second line, we declare i to be the variable that
	 will take the 
        different values contained in $( ls ).
        <p> The third line could be longer if needed, or there could
	 be more lines 
        before the done (4).
        <p> 'done' (4) indicates that the code that used the value of $i has
        finished and $i can take a new value.
        <p> This script has very little sense, but a more useful way to use the
        for loop would be to use it to match only certain files on the previous
         example
    <p>

             echo The counter is $COUNTER
             let COUNTER=COUNTER+1 
         done
         </verb></tscreen>

<!-- Functions -->
<sect>
Functions
     <P> As in almost any programming language, you can use functions to group 
     pieces of code in a more logical way or practice the divine art of recursion.
     <P> Declaring a function is just a matter of writing function my_func { my_code }.
     <P> Calling a function is just like calling another program, you just write its name.
     <P>
     <sect1>
     Functions sample
           <P> <tscreen><verb>
	   1)  #!/bin/bash 
	   2)  function quit {
	   3)      exit
	   4)  }
	   5)  function hello {
	   6)      echo Hello!
	   7)  }
	   8)  hello
	   9)  quit
	   10) echo foo 
	   </verb></tscreen>
	   <P> Lines 2-4 contain the 'quit' function. Lines 5-7 contain the 'hello' function
	   If you are not absolutely sure about what this script does, please try it!.
	   <P> Notice that a functions don't need to be declared in any specific order.
	   <P> When running the script you'll notice that first: the function 'hello' is 
	   called, second the 'quit' function, and the program never reaches line 10.

           <P> If you run this script you'll see that it is a 
           programmer's dream for text based menus. You'll probably notice 
           that it's very similar to the 'for' construction, only rather 
           than looping for each 'word' in $OPTIONS, it prompts the user.

    Arithmetic evaluation
         <P> On the command line (or a shell) try this:
	 <P> echo 1 + 1
	 <P> If you expected to see '2' you'll be disappointed. What if 
	 you want BASH to evaluate some numbers you have? The solution
	 is this:
	 <P> echo $((1+1))
	 <P> This will produce a more 'logical' output. This is to evaluate an
	 arithmetic expression. You can achieve this also like this:
	 <P> echo $[1+1]
	 <P>
	 <P> If you need to use fractions, or more math or you just want it, you 
	 can use bc to evaluate arithmetic expressions.
	 <P> if i ran "echo $[3/4]" at the command prompt, it would return 0 
	 because bash  only uses integers when answering. If you  ran
	  "echo 3/4|bc -l", it would properly return 0.75.

    Finding bash  
         <P> From a message from mike (see Thanks to) 
         <P> you always use #!/bin/bash .. you might was to give an example of
         <P> how to find where bash is located.
         <P> 'locate bash' is preferred, but not all machines have locate.
         <P> 'find ./ -name bash' from the root dir will work, usually.
         <P> Suggested locations to check:
         <P>         ls -l /bin/bash
