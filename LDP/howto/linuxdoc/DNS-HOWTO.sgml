<sect1>Credits and request for help.

<p>I want to thank Arnt Gulbrandsen whom I cause to suffer through the
drafts to this work and who provided many useful suggestions.  I also
want to thank the numerous people that have e-mailed suggestions and
notes.

<p>This will never be a finished document; please send me mail about
your problems and successes.  You can help make this a better HOWTO.
So please send comments and/or questions or money to janl@linpro.no.
Or buy my DNS book.  See the bibliography for information about that.
If you send e-mail and want an answer please show the simple courtesy
of <em/making sure/ that the return address is correct and working.
Also, <bf/please/ read the <ref id="qanda" name="qanda"> section
before mailing me.  Another thing, I can only understand Norwegian and
English.

<p>This is a HOWTO.  I have maintained it as part of the LDP since
1995.  I have, during 2000, written a book on the same subject.  I
want to say that, though this HOWTO is in many ways much like the book
it is <em>not</em> a watered down version concocted to market the
book.  You will however find the book in the bibliography at the end
of this HOWTO.  The readers of this HOWTO have helped me understand
what is difficult to understand about DNS.  This has helped the book,
but the book has also helped me to think more about what this HOWTO
needs.  The HOWTO begot the book.  The book begot version 3 of this
HOWTO.  My thanks to the book publisher, Que, that took a chance on me
:-)

<!-- This is a comment meant for translators:

If you're a translator you may put information about reaching someone
speaking the language you translate to, and that can help with DNS
problems, such as yourself, here (otherwise I get mail in chinese and
spanish asking for help about DNS)

If you want to translate this HOWTO please notify me so I can keep
track of what languages it has been published in, and also I can
notify you when the HOWTO has been updated. -->

<sect1>Dedication

<p>This HOWTO is dedicated to Anne Line Norheim Langfeldt.  Though she
will probably never read it since she's not that kind of girl.

<sect>Introduction.<label id="intro">

<p><bf/What this is and isn't./

<p>DNS is the Domain Name System.  DNS converts machine names to the
IP addresses that all machines on the net have.  It translates (or
"maps" as the jargon would have it) from name to address and from
address to name, and some other things.  This HOWTO documents how to
define such mappings using Unix system, with a few things specific to
Linux.

<p>A mapping is simply an association between two things, in this case
a machine name, like <tt>ftp.linux.org</tt>, and the machine's IP
number (or address) <tt/199.249.150.4/.  DNS also contains mappings
the other way, from the IP number to the machine name; this is called
a "reverse mapping".

<p>DNS is, to the uninitiated (you ;-), one of the more opaque areas
of network administration.  Fortunately DNS isn't really that hard.
This HOWTO will try to make a few things clearer.  It describes how to
set up a <em/simple/ DNS name server, starting with a caching only
server and going on to setting up a primary DNS server for a domain.
For more complex setups you can check the <ref id="qanda"
name="qanda"> section of this document.  If it's not described there
you will need to <em/read/ the Real Documentation.  I'll get back to
what this Real Documentation consists of in <ref id="bigger" name="the
last chapter">.

<p>Before you start on this you should configure your machine so that
you can telnet in and out of it, and successfully make all kinds of
connections to the net, and you should especially be able to do
<tt/telnet 127.0.0.1/ and get your own machine (test it now!).  You
also need good <tt>/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt>, <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt>
and <tt>/etc/hosts</tt> files as a starting point, since I will not
explain their function here.  If you don't already have all this set
up and working the Networking-HOWTO and/or the
Networking-Overview-HOWTO explains how to set it up.  Read them.

<p>When I say `your machine' I mean the machine you are trying to set
up DNS on, not any other machine you might have that's involved in
your networking effort.

<p>I assume you're not behind any kind of firewall that blocks name
queries.  If you are you will need a special configuration --- see the
section on <ref id="qanda" name="qanda">.

<p>Name serving on Unix is done by a program called <tt/named/.  This
is a part of the ``BIND'' package which is coordinated by The Internet
Software Consortium.  <tt/Named/ is included in most Linux
distributions and is usually installed as <tt>/usr/sbin/named</tt>,
usually from a package called <tt/BIND/.  

<p>If you have a named you can probably use it; if you don't have one
you can get a binary off a Linux ftp site, or get the latest and
greatest source from <url url="ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind/src/">.
This HOWTO is about BIND version 8.  The old version of the HOWTO,
about BIND 4, is still available at <url
url="http://www.math.uio.no/~janl/DNS/"> in case you use BIND 4.  If
the named man page talks about (at the very end, in the FILES section)
<tt/named.conf/ you have BIND 8; if it talks about <tt/named.boot/ you
have BIND 4.  If you have 4 and are security conscious you really
ought to upgrade to the latest version of BIND 8.  Now.

<p>DNS is a net-wide database.  Take care about what you put into it.
If you put junk into it, you, and others, will get junk out of it.
Keep your DNS tidy and consistent and you will get good service from
it.  Learn to use it, admin it, debug it and you will be another good
admin keeping the net from falling to its knees by mismanagement.

<p><bf/Tip:/ Make backup copies of all the files I instruct you to
change if you already have them, so that if after going through this
nothing works you can get it back to your old, working state.

<sect>A resolving, caching name server.<label id="caching">

<p><bf/A first stab at DNS config, very useful for dialup, cable-modem
and ADSL users./

<p>On Red Hat and Red Hat related distributions you can achieve the
same practical result as this HOWTO's first section by installing the
packages <tt/bind/, <tt/bind-utils/ and caching-nameserver.  If you
use Debian simply install <tt/bind/ and <tt/bind-doc/.  Of course just
installing those packages won't teach you as much as reading this
HOWTO.  So install the packages, and then read along verifying the
files they installed.

<p>A caching only name server will find the answer to name queries and
remember the answer the next time you need it.  This will shorten the
waiting time the next time significantly, especially if you're on a
slow connection.

<p>First you need a file called <tt>/etc/named.conf</tt> (Debian:
<tt>/etc/bind/named.conf</tt>).  This is read when named starts.  For
now it should simply contain:

<code>
// Config file for caching only name server

options {
	directory "/var/named";

	// Uncommenting this might help if you have to go through a
	// firewall and things are not working out.  But you probably
	// need to talk to your firewall admin.

	// query-source port 53;
};

zone "." {
        type hint;
        file "root.hints";
};

zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" {
        type master;
        file "pz/127.0.0";
};
</code>

<p>The Linux distribution packages may use different file names for
each kind of file mentioned here; they will still contain about the
same things.

<p>The `<tt/directory/' line tells named where to look for files.  All
files named subsequently will be relative to this.  Thus <tt>pz</tt>
is a directory under <tt>/var/named</tt>, i.e.,
<tt>/var/named/pz</tt>.  <tt>/var/named</tt> is the right directory
according to the <em/Linux File system Standard/.

<p>The file named <tt>/var/named/root.hints</tt> is named in this.
<tt>/var/named/root.hints</tt> should contain this: (<em/If you cut
and paste this file from an electronic version of this document,
please note that there should be <bf/no/ leading spaces in the file,
i.e. all the lines should start with a non-blank character.  Some
document processing software will insert spaces at beginning of the
lines, causing some confusion.  In that case please remove the leading
spaces/)

<p>The file describes the root name servers in the world.  The servers
change over time and must be maintained now and then.  See the <ref
id="maint" name="maintenance section"> for how to keep it up to date.

<p>The next section in <tt/named.conf/ is the last <tt/zone/. I will
explain its use in a later chapter; for now just make this a file
named <tt/127.0.0/ in the subdirectory <tt/pz/: (<em/Again, please
remove leading spaces if you cut and paste this/)

<code>
$TTL 3D
@               IN      SOA     ns.linux.bogus. hostmaster.linux.bogus. (
				1       ; Serial
				8H	; Refresh
				2H      ; Retry
				4W	; Expire
				1D)	; Minimum TTL
			NS      ns.linux.bogus.
1			PTR	localhost.
</code>

<p>Next, you need a <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> looking something like
this: (<em/Again: Remove spaces!/)

<code>
search subdomain.your-domain.edu your-domain.edu
nameserver 127.0.0.1
</code>

<p>The `<tt/search/' line specifies what domains should be searched
for any host names you want to connect to.  The `<tt/nameserver/' line
specifies the address of your nameserver, in this case your own
machine since that is where your named runs (127.0.0.1 is right, no
matter if your machine has another address too).  If you want to list
several name servers put in one `<tt/nameserver/' line for
each. (Note: Named never reads this file, the resolver that uses named
does. Note 2: In some resolv.conf files you find a line saying
"domain".  That's fine, but don't use both "search" and "domain", only
one of them will work).

<p>To illustrate what this file does: If a client tries to look up
<tt>foo</tt>, then <tt>foo.subdomain.your-domain.edu</tt> is tried
first, then <tt>foo.your-domain.edu</tt>, and finally <tt>foo</tt>.
You may not want to put in too many domains in the search line, as it
takes time to search them all.

<p>The example assumes you belong in the domain
<tt>subdomain.your-domain.edu</tt>; your machine, then, is probably
called <tt>your-machine.subdomain.your-domain.edu</tt>.  The search
line should not contain your TLD (Top Level Domain, `<tt/edu/' in this
case).  If you frequently need to connect to hosts in another domain
you can add that domain to the search line like this: (<em/Remember to
remove the leading spaces, if any/)

<code>
search subdomain.your-domain.edu your-domain.edu other-domain.com
</code>

and so on. Obviously you need to put real domain names in instead.
Please note the lack of periods at the end of the domain names.  This
is important; please note the lack of periods at the end of the domain
names.

<sect1>Starting named<label id="starting">

<p>After all this it's time to start named.  If you're using a dialup
connection connect first.  Type `<tt/ndc start/', and press return, no
options.  If that does not work try `<tt>/usr/sbin/ndc start</tt>'
instead.  If that back-fires see the <ref id="qanda" name="qanda">
section.  If you view your syslog message file (usually called
<tt>/var/adm/messages</tt>, but another directory to look in is
<tt>/var/log</tt> and another file to look in is <tt/syslog/) while
starting named (do <tt>tail -f /var/log/messages</tt>) you should see
something like:

<p>If there are any messages about errors then there is a mistake.
Named will name the file it is in.  Go back and check the file.  Run
"ndc restart" when you have fixed it.

<p>Now you can test your setup.  Traditionally a program called
<tt/nslookup/ is used for this.  These days <tt/dig/ is recommended:

<tscreen><verb>
$ dig -x 127.0.0.1

<p>If that's what you get it's working.  We hope.  Anything else, go
back and check everything.  Each time you change the <tt/named.conf/
file you need to restart named using the <tt/ndc restart/ command.

<p>Now you can enter a query.  Try looking up some machine close to
you.  <tt/pat.uio.no/ is close to me, at the University of Oslo:

<p>This time dig asked your named to look for the machine
<tt/pat.uio.no/.  It then contacted one of the name server machines
named in your <tt>root.hints</tt> file, and asked its way from there.
It might take tiny while before you get the result as it may need to
search all the domains you named in <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt>.  Please
note the "aa" on the "flags:" line.  It means that the answer is
authoritative, that it is fresh from an authoritative server.  I'll
explain "authoritative" later.

<p>If you ask the same again you get this:

<p>Note the lack of a "aa" flag in this answer. That means that named
did not go out on the network to ask this time, as the information is
in the cache now.  But the cached information <em/might/ be out of
date (stale).  So you are informed of this (very slight) possibility
by the "aa" not being there.  But, now you know that your cache is
working.

<sect1>Resolvers

<p>All OSes implementing the standard C API has the calls
gethostbyname and gethostbyaddr.  These can get information from
several different sources.  Which sources it gets it from is
configured in <tt>/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt> on Linux (and some other
Unixes).  This is a long file specifying from which file or database
to get different kinds of data types.  It usually contains helpful
comments at the top, which you should consider reading.  After that
find the line starting with `<tt/hosts:/'; it should read:

<code>
hosts:      files dns
</code>

(<em/You remembered about the leading spaces, right? I won't mention
them again./)

<p>If there is no line starting with `<tt/hosts:/' then put in the one
above.  It says that programs should first look in the
<tt>/etc/hosts</tt> file, then check DNS according to
<tt/resolv.conf/.


<sect1>Congratulations

<p>Now you know how to set up a caching named.  Take a beer, milk, or
whatever you prefer to celebrate it.


<sect>Forwarding

<p>In large, well organized, academic or ISP (Internet Service
Provider) networks you will sometimes find that the network people
have set up a forwarder hierarchy of DNS servers which helps lighten
the internal network load and the load on the outside servers as well.
It's not easy to know if you're inside such a network or not.  It is
however not important and by using the DNS server of your network
provider as a ``forwarder'' you can make the responses to queries
faster and less of a load on your network.  If you use a modem this
can be quite a win.  For the sake of this example we assume that your
network provider has two name servers they want you to use, with IP
numbers <tt/10.0.0.1/ and <tt/10.1.0.1/.  Then, in your
<tt/named.conf/ file, inside the opening section called ``options'',
insert these lines:

<code>
           forward first;
           forwarders {
                10.0.0.1;
                10.1.0.1;
            };
</code>

<p>There is also a nice trick for dialup machines using forwarders, it
is described in the <ref id="qanda" name="qanda"> section.

<p>Restart your nameserver and test it with dig.  Should work fine.

<sect>A <em/simple/ domain.<label id="simple">

<p><bf>How to set up your own domain.</bf>

<sect1>But first some dry theory

<p>First of all: you read all the stuff before here right? You have
to.

<p>Before we <em/really/ start this section I'm going to serve you
some theory on and an example of how DNS works.  And you're going to
read it because it's good for you.  If you don't want to you should at
least skim it very quickly.  Stop skimming when you get to what should
go in your <tt/named.conf/ file.

<p>DNS is a hierarchical, tree structured, system.  The top is written
`<tt/./' and pronounced `root', as is usual for tree data-structures.
Under <tt/./ there are a number of Top Level Domains (TLDs); the best
known ones are <tt/ORG/, <tt/COM/, <tt/EDU/ and <tt/NET/, but there
are many more.  Just like a tree it has a root and it branches out.
If you have any computer science background you will recognize DNS as
a search tree, and you will be able to find nodes, leaf nodes and
edges.  The dots are nodes, the edges are on the names.

<p>When looking for a machine the query proceeds recursively into the
hierarchy starting at the root.  If you want to find the address of
<tt/prep.ai.mit.edu./, your nameserver has to start asking somewhere.
It starts by looking it its cache.  If it knows the answer, having
cached it before, it will answer right away as we saw in the last
section.  If it does not know it will remove parts from the name
starting at the left, checking if it knows anything about
<tt/ai.mit.edu./, then <tt/mit.edu./, then <tt/edu./ and if not that
it does know about <tt/./ because that was in the hints file.  It will
then ask a <tt/./ server about <tt/prep.ai.mit.edu/. This <tt/./
server will not know the answer, but it will help your server on its
way by giving a referral, telling it where to look instead.  These
referrals will eventually lead your server to a nameserver that knows
the answer.  I will illustrate that now.  <tt/+norec/ means that dig
is asking non-recursive questions so that we get to do the recursion
ourselves.  The other options are to reduce the amount of dig produces
so this won't go on for too many pages:

<p>This time we got a "ANSWER SECTION", and an answer for our
question.  The "AUTHORITY SECTION" contains information about which
servers to ask about <tt/ai.mit.edu/ the next time.  So you can ask
them directly the next time you wonder about <tt/ai.mit.edu/ names.

<p>So starting at <tt/./ we found the successive name servers for each
level in the domain name by referral.  If you had used your own DNS
server instead of using all those other servers, your named would
of-course cache all the information it found while digging this out
for you, and it would not have to ask again for a while.

<p>In the tree analogue each ``<tt/./'' in the name is a branching
point.  And each part between the ``<tt/./''s are the names of
individual branches in the tree.  One climbs the tree by taking the
name we want (<tt/prep.ai.mit.edu/) asking the root (<tt/./) or
whatever servers father from the root toward prep.ai.mit.edu we have
information about in the cache.  Once the cache limits are reached
the recursive resolver goes out asking servers, pursuing referrals
(edges) further into the name.

<p>A much less talked about, but just as important domain is
<tt/in-addr.arpa/.  It too is nested like the `normal' domains.
<tt/in-addr.arpa/ allows us to get the host's name when we have its
address.  A important thing to note here is that the IP addresses are
written in reverse order in the <tt/in-addr.arpa/ domain.  If you have
the address of a machine: <tt/192.148.52.43/ named proceeds just like
for the <tt/prep.ai.mit.edu/ example: find <tt/arpa./ servers.  Find
<tt/in-addr.arpa./ servers, find <tt/192.in-addr.arpa./ servers, find
<tt/148.192.in-addr.arpa./ servers, find <tt/52.148.192.in-addr.arpa./
servers.  Find needed records for <tt/43.52.148.192.in-addr.arpa./
Clever huh? (Say `yes'.)  The reversion of the numbers can be
confusing for years though.

<sect1>Our own domain

<p>Now to define our own domain.  We're going to make the domain
<tt/linux.bogus/ and define machines in it.  I use a totally bogus
domain name to make sure we disturb no-one Out There.

<p>One more thing before we start: Not all characters are allowed in
host names.  We're restricted to the characters of the English
alphabet: a-z, and numbers 0-9 and the character '-' (dash).  Keep to
those characters.  Upper and lower-case characters are the same for
DNS, so <tt/pat.uio.no/ is identical to <tt/Pat.UiO.No/.

<p>We've already started this part with this line in <tt/named.conf/:

<code>
zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" {
	type master;
	file "pz/127.0.0";
};
</code>

<p>Please note the lack of `<tt/./' at the end of the domain names in
this file.  This says that now we will define the zone
<tt/0.0.127.in-addr.arpa/, that we're the master server for it and
that it is stored in a file called <tt>pz/127.0.0</tt>.  We've already
set up this file, it reads:

<code>
$TTL 3D
@               IN      SOA     ns.linux.bogus. hostmaster.linux.bogus. (
				1       ; Serial
				8H	; Refresh
				2H      ; Retry
				4W	; Expire
				1D)	; Minimum TTL
			NS      ns.linux.bogus.
1			PTR	localhost.
</code>

<p>Please note the `<tt/./' at the end of all the full domain names in
this file, in contrast to the <tt/named.conf/ file above. Some people
like to start each zone file with a <tt/&dollar;ORIGIN/ directive, but
this is superfluous.  The origin (where in the DNS hierarchy it
belongs) of a zone file is specified in the zone section of the
<tt/named.conf/ file; in this case it's <tt/0.0.127.in-addr.arpa/.

<p>This `zone file' contains 3 `resource records' (RRs): A SOA RR.  A
NS RR and a PTR RR.  SOA is short for Start Of Authority.  The `@' is a
special notation meaning the origin, and since the `domain' column for
this file says 0.0.127.in-addr.arpa the first line really means

<tscreen><verb>
0.0.127.in-addr.arpa.	IN	SOA ...
</verb></tscreen>

<p>NS is the Name Server RR.  There is no '@' at the start of this
line; it is implicit since the previous line started with a '@'.
Saves some typing that.  So the NS line could also be written

<tscreen><verb>
0.0.127.in-addr.arpa.	IN	NS	ns.linux.bogus
</verb></tscreen>

<p>It tells DNS what machine is the name server of the domain
<tt/0.0.127.in-addr.arpa/, it is <tt/ns.linux.bogus/.  'ns' is a
customary name for name-servers, but as with web servers who are
customarily named <tt/www./<em/something/ the name may be anything.

<p>And finally the PTR (Domain Name Pointer) record says that the host
at address 1 in the subnet <tt/0.0.127.in-addr.arpa/, i.e., 127.0.0.1
is named <tt/localhost/.

<p>The SOA record is the preamble to <em/all/ zone files, and there
should be exactly one in each zone file.  It describes the zone, where
it comes from (a machine called <tt/ns.linux.bogus/), who is
responsible for its contents (<tt/hostmaster@linux.bogus/; you should
insert your e-mail address here), what version of the zone file this
is (serial: 1), and other things having to do with caching and
secondary DNS servers.  For the rest of the fields (refresh, retry,
expire and minimum) use the numbers used in this HOWTO and you should
be safe.  Before the SOA comes a mandatory line, the <tt/$TTL 3D/
line.  Put it in all your zone files.

<p>Now restart your named (the command is <tt/ndc restart/) and use
dig to examine your handy work.  <tt/-x/ asks for the inverse query:

<tscreen><verb>
$ dig -x 127.0.0.1

; <<>> DiG 8.2 <<>> -x

<p>So it manages to get <tt/localhost/ from 127.0.0.1, good.  Now for
our main task, the <tt/linux.bogus/ domain, insert a new 'zone'
section in <tt/named.conf/:

<code>
zone "linux.bogus" {
	notify no;
	type master;
	file "pz/linux.bogus";
};
</code>

<p>Note again the lack of ending `<tt/./' on the domain name in the
<tt/named.conf/ file.

<p>In the <tt/linux.bogus/ zone file we'll put some totally bogus
data:

<code>
;
; Zone file for linux.bogus
;
; The full zone file
;
$TTL 3D
@	IN	SOA	ns.linux.bogus. hostmaster.linux.bogus. (
			199802151	; serial, todays date + todays serial #

;
localhost	A	127.0.0.1
ns		A	192.168.196.2
mail		A	192.168.196.4
</code>

<p>Two things must be noted about the SOA record.  <tt/ns.linux.bogus/
<em/must/ be a actual machine with a A record.  It is not legal to
have a CNAME record for the machine mentioned in the SOA record.  Its
name need not be `ns', it could be any legal host name.  Next,
hostmaster.linux.bogus should be read as hostmaster@linux.bogus.  This
should be a mail alias, or a mailbox, where the person(s) maintaining
DNS should read mail frequently.  Any mail regarding the domain will
be sent to the address listed here.  The name need not be
`hostmaster', it can be your normal e-mail address, but the e-mail
address `hostmaster' is often expected to work as well.

<p>There is one new RR type in this file, the MX, or Mail eXchanger
RR.  It tells mail systems where to send mail that is addressed to
<tt/someone@linux.bogus/, namely to <tt/mail.linux.bogus/ or
<tt/mail.friend.bogus/.  The number before each machine name is that
MX RR's priority.  The RR with the lowest number (10) is the one mail
should be sent to if possible.  If that fails the mail can be sent to
one with a higher number, a secondary mail handler, i.e.,
<tt/mail.friend.bogus/ which has priority 20 here.

<p>Restart named by running <tt/ndc restart/.  Examine the results
with dig:

<p>Upon careful examination you will discover a bug.  The line

<tscreen><verb>
linux.bogus.            3D IN MX        10 mail.linux.bogus.linux.bogus.
</verb></tscreen>

<p>is all wrong.  It should be

<tscreen><verb>
linux.bogus.            3D IN MX        10 mail.linux.bogus.
</verb></tscreen>

<p>I deliberately made a mistake so you could learn from it :-)
Looking in the zone file we find this line:

<tscreen><verb>
		MX	10 mail.linux.bogus	; Primary Mail Exchanger
</verb></tscreen>

<p>It is missing a period.  Or has a 'linux.bogus' too many.  If a
machine name does not end in a period in a zone file the origin is
added to its end causing the double <tt/linux.bogus.linux.bogus/.  So
either

<code>
		MX	10 mail.linux.bogus.	; Primary Mail Exchanger
</code>

or

<code>
		MX	10 mail			; Primary Mail Exchanger
</code>

is correct.  I prefer the latter form, it's less to type.  There are
some BIND experts that disagree, and some that agree with this.  In a
zone file the domain should either be written out and ended with a
`<tt/./' or it should not be included at all, in which case it
defaults to the origin.

<p>I must stress that in the named.conf file there should <em/not/ be
`<tt/./'s after the domain names.  You have no idea how many times a
`<tt/./' too many or few have fouled up things and confused the h*ll
out of people.

<p>So having made my point here is the new zone file, with some extra
information in it as well:

<code>

		HINFO	"P6" "Linux 2.1.86"
</code>

<p>There are a number of new RRs here: HINFO (Host INFOrmation) has
two parts; it's a good habit to quote each.  The first part is the
hardware or CPU on the machine, and the second part the software or OS
on the machine.  The machine called 'ns' has a Pentium CPU and runs
Linux 2.0.  CNAME (Canonical NAME) is a way to give each machine
several names.  So www is an alias for ns.

<p>CNAME record usage is a bit controversial. But it's safe to follow
the rule that a MX, CNAME or SOA record should <em/never/ refer to a
CNAME record, they should only refer to something with an A record, so
it is inadvisable to have

<code>
foobar		CNAME	www			; NO!
</code>

but correct to have

<code>
foobar		CNAME	ns			; Yes!
</code>

<p>It's also safe to assume that a CNAME is not a legal host name for
an e-mail address: <tt/webmaster@www.linux.bogus/ is an illegal e-mail
address given the setup above.  You can expect quite a few mail admins
Out There to enforce this rule even if it works for you.  The way to
avoid this is to use A records (and perhaps some others too, like a MX
record) instead:

<code>
www		A	192.168.196.2
</code>

<p>A number of the arch-BIND-wizards, recommend <em/not/ using CNAME
at all. But the discussion of why or why not is beyond the scope of
this HOWTO.

<p>But as you see, this HOWTO and many sites do not follow this rule.

<p>Load the new database by running <tt/ndc reload/, which causes
named to read its files again.

<p>That's good.  As you see it looks a lot like the zone file itself.
Let's check what it says for <tt/www/ alone:

<tscreen><verb>
$ dig www.linux.bogus +pfmin
;; res options: init recurs defnam dnsrch
;; got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 27345

ns.linux.bogus.         3D IN A         192.168.196.2
</verb></tscreen>

<p>In other words, the real name of <tt/www.linux.bogus/ is
<tt/ns.linux.bogus/, and it gives you some of the information it has
about ns as well, enough to connect to it if you were a program.

<p>Now we're halfway.

<sect1>The reverse zone

<p>Now programs can convert the names in linux.bogus to addresses
which they can connect to. But also required is a reverse zone, one
making DNS able to convert from an address to a name. This name is
used by a lot of servers of different kinds (FTP, IRC, WWW and others)
to decide if they want to talk to you or not, and if so, maybe even
how much priority you should be given. For full access to all services
on the Internet a reverse zone is required.

<p>Put this in <tt/named.conf/:

<code>
zone "196.168.192.in-addr.arpa" {
	notify no;
        type master;
        file "pz/192.168.196";
};
</code>

<p>This is exactly as with the <tt/0.0.127.in-addr.arpa/, and the
contents are similar:

<code>
$TTL 3D
@	IN	SOA	ns.linux.bogus. hostmaster.linux.bogus. (
			199802151 ; Serial, todays date + todays serial
			8H	; Refresh
			2H      ; Retry
			4W	; Expire
			1D)	; Minimum TTL
		NS      ns.linux.bogus.

1		PTR	gw.linux.bogus.
2		PTR	ns.linux.bogus.
3		PTR	donald.linux.bogus.
4		PTR	mail.linux.bogus.
5		PTR	ftp.linux.bogus.
</code>

<p>Now you restart your named (<tt/ndc restart/) and examine your
work with dig again:

<code>
$ dig -x 192.168.196.4 +pfmin
;; res options: init recurs defnam dnsrch
;; got answer:

;; ANSWER SECTION:

</code>

<p>so, it looks OK, dump the whole thing to examine that too:

<p>Looks good!  If your output didn't look like that look for
error-messages in your syslog, I explained how to do that in the first
section under the heading <ref id="starting" name="Starting named">

<sect1>Words of caution

<p>There are some things I should add here.  The IP numbers used in
the examples above are taken from one of the blocks of 'private nets',
i.e., they are not allowed to be used publicly on the Internet.  So
they are safe to use in an example in a HOWTO.  The second thing is
the <tt/notify no;/ line.  It tells named not to notify its secondary
(slave) servers when it has gotten a update to one of its zone files.
In BIND-8 the named can notify the other servers listed in NS records
in the zone file when a zone is updated.  This is handy for ordinary
use.  But for private experiments with zones this feature should be
off --- we don't want the experiment to pollute the Internet do we?

<p>And, of course, this domain is highly bogus, and so are all the
addresses in it.  For a real example of a real-life domain see the
next main-section.

<sect1>Why reverse lookups don't work.

<p>There are a couple of ``gotchas'' that normally are avoided with
name lookups that are often seen when setting up reverse zones.
Before you go on you need reverse lookups of your machines working on
your own nameserver.  If it isn't go back and fix it before
continuing.

<p>I will discuss two failures of reverse lookups as seen from outside
your network:

<sect2>The reverse zone isn't delegated.

<p>When you ask a service provider for a network-address range and a
domain name the domain name is normally delegated as a matter of course.
A delegation is the glue NS record that helps you get from one
nameserver to another as explained in the dry theory section above.
You read that, right?  If your reverse zone doesn't work go back and
read it.  Now.

<p>The reverse zone also needs to be delegated.  If you got the
<tt/192.168.196/ net with the <tt/linux.bogus/ domain from your
provider they need to put <tt/NS/ records in for your reverse zone as
well as for your forward zone.  If you follow the chain from
<tt/in-addr.arpa/ and up to your net you will probably find a break in
the chain, most probably at your service provider.  Having found the
break in the chain contact your service-provider and ask them to
correct the error.

<sect2>You've got a classless subnet

<p>This is a somewhat advanced topic, but classless subnets are very
common these days and you probably have one if you're a small company.

<p>A classless subnet is what keeps the Internet going these days.
Some years ago there was much ado about the shortage of IP numbers.
The smart people in IETF (the Internet Engineering Task Force, they
keep the Internet working) stuck their heads together and solved the
problem.  At a price.  The price is that you'll get less than a ``C''
subnet and some things may break.  Please see <url name="Ask Mr. DNS
at" url="http://www.acmebw.com/askmrdns/00007.htm" > for an good
explanation of this and how to handle it.

<p>Did you read it?  I'm not going to explain it so please read it.

<p>The first part of the problem is that your ISP must understand the
technique described by Mr. DNS.  Not all small ISPs have a working
understanding of this.  If so you might have to explain to them and be
persistent.  But be sure you understand it first ;-).  They will then
set up a nice reverse zone at their server which you can examine for
correctness with dig.

<p>The second and last part of the problem is that you must understand
the technique.  If you're unsure go back and read about it again.
Then you can set up your own classless reverse zone as described by
Mr. DNS.

<p>There is another trap lurking here.  Old resolvers will <em/not/ be
able to follow the <tt/CNAME/ trick in the resolving chain and will
fail to reverse-resolve your machine.  This can result in the service
assigning it an incorrect access class, deny access or something along
those lines.  If you stumble into such a service the only solution
(that I know of) is for your ISP to insert your PTR record directly
into their trick classless zone file instead of the trick CNAME
record.

<p>Some ISPs will offer other ways to handle this, like Web based
forms for you to input your reverse-mappings in or other automagical
systems.

<sect1>Slave servers

<p>Once you have set up your zones correctly on the master servers you
need to set up at least one slave server.  Slave servers are needed
for robustness.  If your master goes down the people out there on the
net will still be able to get information about your domain from the
slave.  A slave should be as long away from you as possible.  Your
master and slave should share as few as possible of these: Power
supply, LAN, ISP, city and country.  If all of these things are
different for your master and slave you've found a really good slave.

<p>A slave is simply a nameserver that copies zone files from a
master.  You set it up like this:

<code>
zone "linux.bogus" {
	type slave;
	file "sz/linux.bogus";
	masters { 192.168.196.2; };
};
</code>

<p>A mechanism called zone-transfer is used to copy the data.  The
zone transfer is controlled by your SOA record:

<code>
@	IN	SOA	ns.linux.bogus. hostmaster.linux.bogus. (
			199802151	; serial, todays date + todays serial #
			8H		; refresh, seconds
			2H		; retry, seconds
			4W		; expire, seconds
			1D )		; minimum, seconds
</code>

<p>A zone is only transferred if the serial number on the master is
larger than on the slave.  Every refresh interval the slave will check
if the master has been updated.  If the check fails (because the
master is unavailable) it will retry the check every retry interval.
If it continues to fail as long as the expire interval the slave will
remove the zone from it's filesystem and no longer be a server for it.


<sect>Basic security options.
<label id="security">

<p><em/By Jamie Norrish/

<p><bf/Setting configuration options to reduce the
possibility of problems./

<p>There are a few simple steps that you can take which will both make
your server more secure and potentially reduce its load. The material
presented here is nothing more than a starting point; if you are
concerned about security (and you should be), please consult other
resources on the net (see <ref id="bigger" name="the last chapter">).

<p>The following configuration directives occur in <tt/named.conf/. If
a directive occurs in the <tt/options/ section of the file, it applies
to all zones listed in that file. If it occurs within a <tt/zone/
entry, it applies only to that zone. A <tt/zone/ entry overrides an
<tt/options/ entry.

<Sect1>Restricting zone transfers

<p>In order for your slave server(s) to be able to answer queries
about your domain, they must be able to transfer the zone information
from your primary server.  Very few others have a need to do so.
Therefore restrict zone transfers using the <tt/allow-transfer/
option, assuming 192.168.1.4 is the IP address of ns.friend.bogus and
adding yourself for debugging purposes:

<code>
zone "linux.bogus" {
      allow-transfer { 192.168.1.4; localhost; };
};
</code>

<p>By restricting zone transfers you ensure that the only information
available to people is that which they ask for directly - no one can
just ask for all the details about your set-up.

<Sect1>Protecting against spoofing

<p>Firstly, disable any queries for domains you don't own, except
from your internal/local machines. This not only helps prevent
malicious use of your DNS server, but also reduces unnecessary use of
your server.

<code>
options {
      allow-query { 192.168.196.0/24; localhost; };
};

zone "linux.bogus" {
      allow-query { any; };
};

zone "196.168.192.in-addr.arpa" {
      allow-query { any; };
};
</code>

<p>Further, disable recursive queries except from internal/local
sources. This reduces the risk of cache poisoning attacks (where false
data is fed to your server).

<code>
options {
	allow-recursion { 192.168.196.0/24; localhost; };
};
</code>

<Sect1>Running named as non-root

<p>It is a good idea to run named as a user other than root, so
that if it is compromised the privileges gained by the cracker are as
limited as possible. You first have to create a user and group for
named to run under, and then modify whatever init script you use that
starts named. Pass the new username and group to named using the -u
and -g flags.

<p>For example, in Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 you might modify your
<tt>/etc/init.d/bind</tt> script to have the following line (where
user and group named have been created:

<code>
start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --exec /usr/sbin/named -- -u named -g named
</code>

<p>The same can be done with Red Hat and the other distributions. Dave
Lugo has described a secure dual chroot setup <url
url="http://www.etherboy.com/dns/chrootdns.html"> which you may find
interesting to read.

<sect>A real domain example<label id="real-example">

<p><bf/Where we list some <em/real/ zone files/

<p>Users have suggested that I include a real example of a working
domain as well as the tutorial example.

<p>I use this example with permission from David Bullock of LAND-5.
These files were current 24th of September 1996, and were then edited
to fit BIND 8 restrictions and use extensions by me.  So, what you see
here differs a bit from what you find if you query LAND-5's name
servers now.

<sect1>/etc/named.conf (or /var/named/named.conf)

<p>Here we find master zone sections for the two reverse zones needed:
the 127.0.0 net, as well as LAND-5's <tt/206.6.177/ subnet, and a
primary line for land-5's forward zone <tt/land-5.com/. Also note that
instead of stuffing the files in a directory called <tt/pz/, as I do
in this HOWTO, he puts them in a directory called <tt/zone/.

<code>
// Boot file for LAND-5 name server

options {
	directory "/var/named";
};

zone "." {
	type hint;
	file "root.hints";
};

zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" {
	type master;
	file "zone/127.0.0";
};

zone "land-5.com" {
	type master;
	file "zone/land-5.com";
};

zone "177.6.206.in-addr.arpa" {
	type master;
	file "zone/206.6.177";
};
</code>

<p>If you put this in your named.conf file to play with <bf/PLEASE/
put ``<tt/notify no;/'' in the zone sections for the two <tt/land-5/
zones so as to avoid accidents.

<sect1>/var/named/root.hints

<p>Keep in mind that this file is dynamic, and the one listed here is
old. You're better off using one produced now, with dig, as explained
earlier.

<sect1>/var/named/zone/127.0.0

<p>Just the basics, the obligatory SOA record, and a record that maps
127.0.0.1 to <tt/localhost/.  Both are required.  No more should be in
this file.  It will probably never need to be updated, unless your
nameserver or hostmaster address changes.

<code>
@               IN      SOA     land-5.com. root.land-5.com. (
                                199609203       ; Serial

<p>If you look at a random BIND installation you will probably find
that the <tt/$TTL/ line is missing as it is here.  It was not used
before, and only version 8.2 of BIND has started to warn about its
absence.  I would recommend that you put the <tt/$TTL/ in line in zone
files as you discover that they are missing.

<sect1>/var/named/zone/land-5.com

<p>Here we see the mandatory SOA record, the needed NS records.  We
can see that he has a secondary name server at <tt/ns2.psi.net/.  This
is as it should be, <em/always/ have a off site secondary server as
backup.  We can also see that he has a master host called <tt/land-5/
which takes care of many of the different Internet services, and that
he's done it with CNAMEs (a alternative is using A records).

<p>As you see from the SOA record, the zone file originates at
<tt/land-5.com/, the contact person is
<tt/root@land-5.com/. <tt/hostmaster/ is another oft used address for
the contact person.  The serial number is in the customary yyyymmdd
format with todays serial number appended; this is probably the sixth
version of zone file on the 20th of September 1996.  Remember that the
serial number <em/must/ increase monotonically, here there is only
<em/one/ digit for todays serial&num;, so after 9 edits he has to wait
until tomorrow before he can edit the file again.  Consider using two
digits.

<p>If you examine land-5s nameserver you will find that the host names
are of the form <tt/ws_/<em/number/.  As of late BIND 4 versions named
started enforcing the restrictions on what characters may be used in
host names.  So that does not work with BIND-8 at all, and I
substituted '-' (dash) for '_' (underline) for use in this HOWTO.

<p>Another thing to note is that the workstations don't have
individual names, but rather a prefix followed by the two last parts
of the IP numbers.  Using such a convention can simplify maintenance
significantly, but can be a bit impersonal, and, in fact, be a source
of irritation among your customers.

<p>We also see that <tt/funn.land-5.com/ is an alias for
<tt/land-5.com/, but using an A record, not a CNAME record.  This is a
good policy as noted earlier.

<p>The reverse zone is the bit of the setup that seems to cause the
most grief.  It is used to find the host name if you have the IP
number of a machine.  Example: you are an IRC server and accept
connections from IRC clients.  However you are a Norwegian IRC server
and so you only want to accept connections from clients in Norway and
other Scandinavian countries.  When you get a connection from a client
the C library is able to tell you the IP number of the connecting
machine because the IP number of the client is contained in all the
packets that are passed over the network.  Now you can call a function
called gethostbyaddr that looks up the name of a host given the IP
number.  Gethostbyaddr will ask a DNS server, which will then traverse
the DNS looking for the machine.  Supposing the client connection is
from ws-177200.land-5.com.  The IP number the C library provides to
the IRC server is 206.6.177.200.  To find out the name of that machine
we need to find <tt/200.177.6.206.in-addr.arpa/.  The DNS server will
first find the <tt/arpa./ servers, then find <tt/in-addr.arpa./
servers, following the reverse trail through 206, then 6 and at last
finding the server for the <tt/177.6.206.in-addr.arpa/ zone at LAND-5.
From which it will finally get the answer that for
<tt/200.177.6.206.in-addr.arpa/ we have a ``<tt/PTR
ws-177200.land-5.com/'' record, meaning that the name that goes with
<tt/206.6.177.200/ is <tt/ws-177200.land-5.com/.  As with the
explanation of how <tt/prep.ai.mit.edu/ is looked up, this is slightly
fictitious.

<p>Getting back to the IRC server example.  The IRC server only
accepts connections from the Scandinavian countries, i.e., <tt/*.no/,
<tt/*.se/, <tt/*.dk/, the name <tt/ws-177200.land-5.com/ clearly does
not match any of those, and the server will deny the connection.  If
there was <em/no/ reverse mapping of <tt/206.2.177.200/ through the
<tt/in-addr.arpa/ zone the server would have been unable to find the
name at all and would have to settle to comparing <tt/206.2.177.200/
with <tt/*.no/, <tt/*.se/ and <tt/*.dk/, none of which will match.

<p>Some people will tell you that reverse lookup mappings are only
important for servers, or not important at all.  Not so: Many ftp,
news, IRC and even some http (WWW) servers will <em/not/ accept
connections from machines of which they are not able to find the name.
So reverse mappings for machines are in fact <em/mandatory/.

<sect>Maintenance<label id="maint">

<p><bf/Keeping it working./

<p>There is one maintenance task you have to do on nameds, other than
keeping them running.  That's keeping the <tt/root.hints/ file
updated.  The easiest way is using dig. First run dig with no
arguments you will get the <tt/root.hints/ according to your own
server.  Then ask one of the listed root servers with <tt/dig
@rootserver/.  You will note that the output looks terribly like a
<tt/root.hints/ file.  Save it to a file (<tt/dig @e.root-servers.net . ns
&gt;root.hints.new/) and replace the old <tt/root.hints/ with it.

<p>Remember to reload named after replacing the cache file.

<p>Al Longyear sent me this script that can be run automatically to
update <tt/root.hints/.  Install a crontab entry to run it once a
month and forget it.  The script assumes you have mail working and
that the mail-alias `hostmaster' is defined.  You must hack it to suit
your setup.

<sect>Converting from version 4 to version 8<label id="bind8">

<p>This was originally a section on using BIND 8 written by David
E. Smith (dave@bureau42.ml.org).  I have edited it some to fit the new
section name.

<p>There's not much to it. Except for using named.conf instead of
named.boot, everything is identical. And BIND 8 comes with a perl
script that converts old-style files to new. Example named.boot (old
style) for a cache-only name server:

<code>
directory /var/named
cache	.	                                root.hints
primary	0.0.127.IN-ADDR.ARPA                    127.0.0.zone
primary	localhost				localhost.zone	 	
</code>

On the command line, in the bind8/src/bin/named directory (<em/this
assumes you got a source distribution.  If you got a binary package
the script is probably around, I'm not sure where it would be
though. -ed./), type:

<code>
./named-bootconf.pl < named.boot > named.conf
</code>

Which creates named.conf:

<code>
// generated by named-bootconf.pl

options {
	directory "/var/named";
};

zone "." {
	type hint;
	file "root.hints";
};

zone "0.0.127.IN-ADDR.ARPA" {
	type master;
	file "127.0.0.zone";
};

zone "localhost" {
	type master;
	file "localhost.zone";
};
</code>

<p>It works for everything that can go into a <tt/named.boot/ file,
although it doesn't add all of the new enhancements and configuration
options that BIND 8 allows.  Here's a more complete <tt/named.conf/
that does the same things, but a little more efficiently.

<code>
// This is a configuration file for named (from BIND 8.1 or later).
// It would normally be installed as /etc/named.conf.
// The only change made from the `stock' named.conf (aside from this
// comment :) is that the directory line was uncommented, since I
// already had the zone files in /var/named.

options {
	directory "/var/named";
	datasize 20M;
};

zone "localhost" IN {
	type master;
	file "localhost.zone";
};

zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" IN {
	type master;
	file "127.0.0.zone";
};

zone "." IN {
	type hint;
	file "root.hints";
};
</code>

<p>In the BIND 8 distributions directory bind8/src/bin/named/test you
find this, and copies of the zone files, that many people can just
drop in and use instantly.

<p>The formats for zone files and <tt/root.hints/ files are identical,
as are the commands for updating them.

  <item>My named wants a named.boot file

  <p>You are reading the wrong HOWTO.  Please see the old version of
  this HOWTO, which covers BIND 4, at <url
  url="http://www.math.uio.no/~janl/DNS/">

  <item>How do use DNS from inside a firewall? 

  <p>A hint: <tt/forward only;/.  You might also need

  <code>
  query-source port 53;
  </code>

  inside the ``options'' part of the <tt/named.conf/ file as suggested
  in the example <ref id="caching" name="caching"> section.

  <item>How do I make DNS rotate through the available addresses for a
  service, say <tt/www.busy.site/ to obtain a load balancing effect,
  or similar?

  <p>Make several <bf/A/ records for <tt/www.busy.site/ and use BIND
  4.9.3 or later.  Then BIND will round-robin the answers.  It will
  <em/not/ work with earlier versions of BIND.

  <item>I want to set up DNS on a (closed) intranet.  What do I do?

  <p>You drop the <tt/root.hints/ file and just do zone files.  That
  also means you don't have to get new hint files all the time.

  <item>How do I set up a secondary (slave) name server?

  <p>If the primary/master server has address 127.0.0.1 you put a line
  like this in the named.conf file of your secondary:

  <code>
  zone "linux.bogus" {
	type slave;
	file "sz/linux.bogus";
	masters { 127.0.0.1; };
  };
  </code>

  You may list several alternate master servers the zone can be copied
  from inside the <tt/masters/ list, separated by ';' (semicolon).

  <item>I want BIND running when I'm disconnected from the net.  

  <p>There are four items regarding this:

<itemize>

  <item>Specific to BIND 8, Adam L Rice has sent me this e-mail, about
  how to run DNS painlessly on a dialup machine:

<tscreen><verb>

I have discovered with newer versions of BIND that this
[<em/shuffeling files, -ed/] is no longer necessary.  There is a
"forward" directive in addition to the "forwarders" directive that
controls how they are used.  The default setting is "forward first",
which first asks each of the forwarders, and then tries the normal
approach of doing the legwork itself if that fails.  This gives the
familiar behaviour of gethostbyname() taking an inordinately long time
when the link is not up.  But if "forward only" is set, then BIND
gives up when it doesn't get a response from the forwarders, and
gethostbyname() returns immediately.  Hence there is no need to
perform sleight-of-hand with files in /etc and restart the server.

In my case, I just added the lines

forward only;
forwarders { 193.133.58.5; };

to the options { } section of my named.conf file. It works very nicely. The
only disadvantage of this is that it reduces an incredibly sophisticated
piece of DNS software to the status of a dumb cache. To some extent, I would
just like to run a dumb cache for DNS instead, but there doesn't seem to be
such a piece of software available for Linux.
</verb></tscreen>


  <item>I have received this mail from Ian Clark
  &lt;ic@deakin.edu.au&gt; where he explains his way of doing this:

<tscreen><verb>
I run named on my 'Masquerading' machine here. I have 
two root.hints files, one called root.hints.real which contains 
the real root server names and the other called root.hints.fake 
which contains...

----
; root.hints.fake
; this file contains no information
----

When I go off line I copy the root.hints.fake file to root.hints and
restart named.

When I go online I copy root.hints.real to root.hints and restart
named.

This is done from ip-down & ip-up respectively.

The first time I do a query off line on a domain name named doesn't
have details for it puts an entry like this in messages..

Jan 28 20:10:11 hazchem named[10147]: No root nameserver for class IN

which I can live with.
	 
It certainly seems to work for me. I can use the nameserver for
local machines while off the 'net without the timeout delay for
external domain names and I while on the 'net queries for external
domains work normally

</verb></tscreen>

<p>Peter Denison thought that Ian does not go far enough though.  He
writes:

<tscreen><verb>
When connected)	serve all cached (and local network) entries immediately
		for non-cached entries, forward to my ISPs nameserver
When off-line)	serve local network queries immediately
		fail all other queries **immediately**

The combination of changing the root cache file and forwarding queries
doesn't work.

So, I've set up (with some discussion of this on the local LUG) two nameds
as follows:

named-online:	forwards to ISPs nameserver
		master for localnet zone
		master for localnet reverse zone (1.168.192.in-addr.arpa)
		master for 0.0.127.in-addr.arpa
		listens on port 60053

named-offline:	no forwarding
		"fake" root cache file
		slave for 3 local zones (master is 127.0.0.1:60053)
		listens on port 61053

And combined this with port forwarding, to send port 53 to 61053 when
off-line, and to port 60053 when online. (I'm using the new netfilter
package under 2.3.18, but the old (ipchains) mechanism should work.)

Note that this won't quite work out-of-the-box, as there's a slight bug in
BIND 8.2, which I have logged wth the developers, preventing a slave
having a master on the same IP address (even if a different port). It's a
trivial patch, and should go in soon I hope.
</verb></tscreen>

<item>I have also received information about how BIND interacts with NFS
and the portmapper on a mostly offline machine from Karl-Max Wanger:

<tscreen><verb>

I use to run my own named on all my machines which are only
occasionally connected to the Internet by modem. The nameserver only
acts as a cache, it has no area of authority and asks back for
everything at the name servers in the root.cache file. As is usual
with Slackware, it is started before nfsd and mountd.

With one of my machines (a Libretto 30 notebook) I had the problem
that sometimes I could mount it from another system connected to my
local LAN, but most of the time it didn't work.  I had the same effect
regardless of using PLIP, a PCMCIA ethernet card or PPP over a serial
interface.

After some time of guessing and experimenting I found out that
apparently named messed with the process of registration nfsd and
mountd have to carry out with the portmapper upon startup (I start
these daemons at boot time as usual). Starting named after nfsd and
mountd eliminated this problem completely.

As there are no disadvantages to expect from such a modified boot
sequence I'd advise everybody to do it that way to prevent potential
trouble.
</verb></tscreen>

<item>Finally, there is HOWTO information about this at <url name="Ask
Mr. DNS at" url="http://www.acmebw.com/askmrdns/#linux-dialup">.  It
is about BIND 4 though, so you have to adapt what he says to BIND 8.

</itemize>

  <item>Where does the caching name server store its cache? Is there
  any way I can control the size of the cache?

  <p>The cache is completely stored in memory, it is <em/not/ written
  to disk at any time.  Every time you kill named the cache is lost.
  The cache is <em/not/ controllable in any way.  named manages it
  according to some simple rules and that is it.  You cannot control
  the cache or the cache size in any way for any reason. If you want
  to you can ``fix'' this by hacking named.  This is however not
  recommended.

  <item>Does named save the cache between restarts?  Can I make it
  save it?

  <p>No, named does <em/not/ save the cache when it dies.  That means
  that the cache must be built anew each time you kill and restart
  named.  There is <em/no/ way to make named save the cache in a file.
  If you want you can ``fix'' this by hacking named.  This is however
  not recommended.

  <item>How can I get a domain? I want to set up my own domain called
  (for example) <tt/linux-rules.net/.  How can I get the domain I want
  assigned to me?

  <p>Please contact your network service provider.  They will be able
  to help you with this.  Please note that in most parts of the world
  you need to pay money to get a domain.

  <item>How can I secure my DNS server?  How do I set up split DNS?

  <p>Both of these are advanced topics.  They are both covered in <url

  explain the topics further here.

<sect>How to become a bigger time DNS admin.<label id="bigger">

<p><bf>Documentation and tools.</bf>

<p>Real Documentation exists.  Online and in print.  The reading of
several of these is required to make the step from small time DNS
admin to a big time one.  In print I have written <em/The Concise
Guide to DNS and BIND/ (by Nicolai Langfeldt), published by Que (ISDN
0-7897-2273-9).  The book is much like this HOWTO.  Just more details,
and a lot more of everything.  But the standard book is <em/DNS and
BIND/ by C. Liu and P. Albitz from O'Reilly &amp; Associates (ISBN
0-937175-82-X).  It's excellent too.  Get the 3rd edition, it covers
BIND 8 as well as BIND 4.  There is also a section on DNS in
<em>TCP/IP Network Administration</em>, by Craig Hunt from O'Reilly
(ISBN 0-937175-82-X).  Another must for good DNS administration (or
good anything for that matter) is <em/Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
Maintenance/ by Robert M. Pirsig :-) Available as ISBN 0688052304 and
others.

<p>Online you will find stuff on <url url="http://www.dns.net/dnsrd/">
(DNS Resources Directory), <url url="http://www.isc.org/bind.html">; A
FAQ, a reference manual (BOG; BIND Operations Guide) as well as papers
and protocol definitions and DNS hacks (these, and most, if not all,
of the RFCs mentioned below, are also contained in the BIND
distribution).  I have not read most of these, but then I'm not a
big-time DNS admin either.  Arnt Gulbrandsen on the other hand has
read BOG and he's ecstatic about it :-).  The newsgroup <url
url="news:comp.protocols.tcp-ip.domains"> is about DNS.  In addition
there are a number of RFCs about DNS, the most important are probably
the ones listed here.  Those that have BCP (Best Current Practice)
numbers are <em/highly recommended/.
