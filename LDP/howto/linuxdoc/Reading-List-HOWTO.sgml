<title>The Linux Reading List HOWTO
<author>by Eric S. Raymond
<date>v1.11, 23 March 2000

<abstract>
This document lists the book I think are most valuable to a person
trying to learn Unix (especially Linux) top to bottom.

<sect>Introduction
<p>
<sect1> Purpose of this document
<p>
This document lists what I consider to be the essential book-length
references for learning Unix (especially Linux) and how to program under
it.

<sect1>New versions of this document
<p>
	New versions of the Linux Reading List HOWTO will be periodically
	posted to <htmlurl url="news:comp.os.linux.answers"
	name="comp.os.linux.answers">.  They will also be uploaded to
	various Linux WWW and FTP sites, including the LDP home page.

	You can also view the latest version of this on the World Wide
	Web via the URL 
	<url url="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Reading-List-HOWTO.html">.

<sect1>Feedback and Corrections
<p>
	If you have questions or comments about this document (or just
	want to suggest a book that you think should be on it), please feel
	free to mail Eric S. Raymond, at <htmlurl
	url="mailto:esr@thyrsus.com" name="esr@thyrsus.com">. I welcome any
	suggestions or criticisms.

	<url name="Linux Documentation Project home page" 
	url="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO">.

	Some years ago I wrote a less Linux-focused Unix bibliography that
	may still be of some interest and retains a certain amusement
	value.  You can find the Loginataka at <url
	url="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/loginataka.html">.

	SAGE, the System Administrator's Guild, maintains an excellent list
	of relevant books at <url

<sect1> Conventions Used In This Document
<p>
Comments not in quotes below are either mine, or I have seen no reason to
change them from those of Jim Haynes (previous maintainer of this document).
Comments sent in by others are in quotes, and have the name of the
commentator before them (JH is Jim Haynes).

"See" URLs attached to publishing information point directly into the
publisher's web catalog and typically take you to a page containing
a cover shot, blurbs, and ordering information.  Books that don't
have these lack them because the publisher is using frames and the
catalog pages can't be bookmarked.

Topic listings go roughly from the outside in (culture to user-land
programming to kernel programming to hardware).  Within sections I have
tried to list the most useful books first insofar as I am familiar with them.
It's just an embarrassing coincidence that this lists one of my books
first, honest! (Suggestions for a better organization cheerfully accepted.)

	Shell (as a programming language for more than trivial scripting)
	is dead.  Perl rules in its place.  This is the second edition of
	the definitive Perl book -- vastly better organized than the first,
	and it covers Perl 5.

	`If you are one of those users who would like to know how LaTeX can
	be extended to create the nicest documents possible without
	becoming a (La)TeX guru, then this book is for you' --- from the

	Bruce Thompson: "The definitive user's guide and complete reference
	manual for TeX.  Probably not needed for casual LaTeX use, but a

	Bruce Thompson: "The definitive user's guide and reference manual

<tag/The Linux Kernel book/
    Rémy Card, &Egrave;ric Dumas, Franck M&eacute;vel; John Wiley and Sons; 1998;
    ISBN 0-471-98141-9.  &dollar;100 (AUS).

    (Translated from the French language edition of "Programmation
    Linux 2.0"; same authors; 1997; Éditions Eyrolles; Paris, France.)

    A very interesting and informative description of the operation of
    the kernel that fills in the gap between the POSIX interface and
    "The Design of the Unix Operating System" and the Linux source
    code.  A good understanding of the design and operation of a Unix
    OS is a pre-requisite, but this book is an excellent help to going
    beyond that general understanding into actual work.

    The primary author is one of the core developers for the ext2
    filesystem, and the Linux Kernel book shows a firm grasp of the
    matter and clear explanations and structure.  It's surprisingly
    readable for something working at such a low level.  The book does
    seem to have suffered a little in the translation to English --
    there are a few typos and grammatical mistakes, but it's quite
    readable.  (The code example files are charmingly still named in
    French.)

    Network protocol implementations are not covered.

    The book's current to Linux 2.0.35 and foreshadows 2.1 and 2.2.

	This explains the 386 features for operating system writers.  It
