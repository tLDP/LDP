<title>mini-HOWTO install qmail with MH
<author>Christopher Richardson (rdn@tara.n.eunet.de)
<date>v1.4, 5 March 1998

<abstract>

I am just documenting my installation experiences to offer some help to
other users who wish to use the above combination for their email.

v1.4 - I have finally got a new Linux box running so I decided to
update this mini-howto

<sect>Introduction


<p> 

My thanks to all netizens who have helped me, especially Tony Nugent
(tony@trishul.sci.gu.edu.au), David Summers (david@summersoft.fay.ar.us)
and S.u.S.E ( Linux distribution) who has made installing Linux so much easier,
and the authors of the above excellent programs.

What is qmail and why should I use it?  Here is the author´s (Dan Bernstein)
blurb:

qmail is a secure, reliable, efficient, simple message transfer agent.
It is meant as a replacement for the entire sendmail-binmail system on
typical Internet-connected UNIX hosts.

Secure: Security isn't just a goal, but an absolute requirement. Mail
delivery is critical for users; it cannot be turned off, so it must be
completely secure. (This is why I started writing qmail: I was sick of
the security holes in sendmail and other MTAs.)

Reliable: qmail's straight-paper-path philosophy guarantees that a
message, once accepted into the system, will never be lost. qmail also
supports maildir, a new, super-reliable user mailbox format. Maildirs,
unlike mbox files and mh folders, won't be corrupted if the system
crashes during delivery. Even better, not only can a user safely read
his mail over NFS, but any number of NFS clients can deliver mail to him
at the same time.

Efficient: On a Pentium under BSD/OS, qmail can easily sustain 200000
local messages per day---that's separate messages injected and delivered
to mailboxes in a real test! Although remote deliveries are inherently
limited by the slowness of DNS and SMTP, qmail overlaps 20 simultaneous
deliveries by default, so it zooms quickly through mailing lists. (This
is why I finished qmail: I had to get a big mailing list set up.)

Simple: qmail is vastly smaller than any other Internet MTA. Some
reasons why: (1) Other MTAs have separate forwarding, aliasing, and
mailing list mechanisms. qmail has one simple forwarding mechanism that
lets users handle their own mailing lists. (2) Other MTAs offer a
spectrum of delivery modes, from fast+unsafe to slow+queued. qmail-send
is instantly triggered by new items in the queue, so the qmail system
has just one delivery mode: fast+queued. (3) Other MTAs include, in
effect, a specialized version of inetd that watches the load average.
qmail's design inherently limits the machine load, so qmail-smtpd can
safely run from your system's inetd.

Replacement for sendmail: qmail supports host and user masquerading,
full host hiding, virtual domains, null clients, list-owner rewriting,
relay control, double-bounce recording, arbitrary RFC 822 address lists,
cross-host mailing list loop detection, per-recipient checkpointing,
downed host backoffs, independent message retry schedules, etc. In
short, it's up to speed on modern MTA features. qmail also includes a
drop-in ``sendmail'' wrapper so that it will be used transparently by
your current UAs.


<sect>My System Details

<p>

SuSE Linux Distribution 5.1 with 2.0.33 kernal.


PPP link to ISP


<sect>Qmail Installation

<p>

Follow the INSTALL instructions exactly. 


Notes:



Please take the time to read the Fine documentation  completely.
The numerals refer to the installation steps in the above INSTALL doc.
<itemize>

<item> 2  - I had to set up the groups and users manually as per INSTALL.ids

<item> 7  - ./qmail-makectl did not work on my system. I added my domain name (mickey.n.eunet.de) manually in /var/qmail/control/me

<item> 23 - Make sure qmail-smtpd is spelt correctly in the inetd-conf file.
        (I spelt it incorrectly i.e. qmail-smptd, which took me two days to find:( )
        smtp  stream  tcp     nowait  qmaild   /var/qmail/bin/tcp-env tcp-env  
        /var/qmail/bin/qmail-smtpd 

</itemize>

<sect1>Maildir2smtp

<p>

Dan Bernstein has provided a package for sending queued email to an ISP
via dial-in. This package is available as serialmailxxx from his site.

Install this package as described in the man page (Thanks Rupert Mazzucco 
(maz@pap.univie.ac.at), it works out of the box!

<tscreen><verb>


       maildir2smtp - blast a maildir across SMTP

       maildir2smtp is designed to pass messages along a SLIP  or
       PPP  link.  To set this up on the disconnected end, create
       a new maildir in alias:

          # maildirmake ~alias/pppdir
          # chown -R alias ~alias/pppdir

       Put

          :alias-ppp

       into control/virtualdomains and

          ./pppdir/

       into ~alias/.qmail-ppp-default.  Don't  forget  the  extra
       slash in pppdir/.  Then, in the PPP startup script, do

          maildir2smtp ~alias/pppdir alias-ppp- $IP `hostname`

       replacing  $IP with the remote IP address.


</verb></tscreen>

Notes:

<itemize>

<item>Please read the Fine manual page completely.

<item>Maildir2smtp requires the dotted IP address of your mail server. If you do not have this then ping YourMail.host.country which will return the IP.

<item>This command can be included in your login script to flush all queued mail after logging in to your ISP.


</itemize>

<sect>MH Installation

 
<p>
In addition to this, I also replaced /mh-6.8.4/mts/sendmail/smail.c with 
Dan Bernstein´s mh-qmail-smail.c

This is what my mh-6.8.4/conf/MH looks like:

<tscreen><code>

</code></tscreen>


Notes:
<itemize>
<item>I have only compiled ``mts sendmail'' - read in comp.mail.mh somewhere that /smtp can cause problems. Dominic Mitchell (hdm@demon.net) wrote in comp.mail.mh (13 June 1997):

``Not quite. With this option MH still talks SMTP, just over a pipe
and not over a network. You *really* need a line in your ~/.mh_profile
which says:

postproc: /usr/local/nmh/lib/spost

Or whever it's kept on your system. This will pass the message
directly to sendmail in the traditional manner. You're using
qmail of course, so sendmail will be qmail's wrapper script, but that's
just fine.'' Thanks Dominic.


<item>I have remmed out ``mail'' because I want to control it via mtstailor
</itemize>

<sect1>mtstailor
<p>

As qmail delivers mail to the home directory (&tilde;/Mailbox). I added the
following to my mtstailor

<tscreen><verb>

localname:	mickey
localdomain:	n.eunet.de
mmdfldir:	
mmdflfil:	Mailbox		
uucpldir:	
uucplfil:	
mmdelim1:	\001\001\001\001\n
mmdelim2:	\001\001\001\001\n
mmailid:	0
umincproc:
lockldir:
sendmail:	/usr/lib/sendmail

</verb></tscreen>



Notes:
<itemize>
<item>sendmail: /usr/lib/sendmail is a link to the qmail sendmail wrapper in
   /var/qmail/bin

<item>MH does not like the tilde notation (&tilde;/) use /home instead or leave blank which according to the docs defaults to &dollar;HOME.
<item>I recently installed MH and qmail on my office machine which is connect via ethernet. I added the following line to mtstailor:

servers: mailserver.company.country

</itemize>

<sect1>mh_profile
<p>

Here is my .mh_profile

<tscreen><verb>

Path: Mail
draft-folder: drafts
unseen-sequence: unseen
AliasFile: /home/rdn/.mh_aliases
send: -msgid
comp: -form /home/rdn/.mymh-components
MailDrop: /home/rdn/Mailbox

</verb></tscreen>

Notes:
<itemize>
<item>I put in the MailDrop line to be ``sure to be sure''.
</itemize>



<sect>Fetchmail
<p>
I decided to use fetchmail because I have a multiuser (my family :).
Linux and fetchmail delivers mail to the smtp port where qmail takes over.


Installation was no problem, multidrop works with the following .fetchmailrc :

<tscreen><verb>

poll PersonalMail.Germany.EU.net
protocol pop3
username myname
password mypassword
# the next two lines do the trick for multidrop
localdomains mydomain.de
is * here
# T2 of the fetchmail FAQ states that qmail needs this
forcecr

</verb></tscreen>

<sect>Exmh
<p>
This is my mailer by choice. I love it. 

There is one problem - most pre-compiled TCL/TK packages have the security 
option compiled in. 
The following script .xserverrc.secure which came with SuSE solves this.

<tscreen><code>

#!/bin/sh

#
# move this file to ~/.xserverrc, if you don't want to allow everybody to
# get access to your X-Server
#
if [ -x /usr/bin/keygen ]; then
    if [ ! -x /usr/bin/hostname -a ! -x /bin/hostname \
	 -a ! -x /usr/bsd/hostname ];
    then
        echo "startx: can't get my hostname - exiting"
	exit 1
    else
	host=`hostname`
    fi

    xauth add $host:0 . `/usr/bin/keygen`
    sleep 2
    xauth add $host/"unix":0 . `/usr/bin/keygen`
    exec X :0 -auth .Xauthority $*
else
    exec X :0 $*
fi

</code></tscreen>



<sect>Procmail
<p>

The qmail FAQ gives this command:

In ~/.qmail add the line 

<tscreen><verb>
| preline procmail
</verb></tscreen>



Version 3.11pre7 has changed the default mail box variable. It used to
be in config.h. It is now in src/authenticate.c:

<tscreen><verb>

#define MAILSPOOLHOME "/Mailbox"	/* watch the leading / */
				        /* delivers to $HOME/Mailbox */

</verb></tscreen>

I have culled from comp.mail.mh ans comp.mail.misc some hints on a .procmailrc file. Thanks to everyone!

Procmail is an excellently documented program. Read the man pages for examples
on how to set up your .procmailrc file. 

<sect> ISDN
<p>

I am including this although this has nothing to do with qmail or
mh. But without a PPP line to your ISP there is no email at all. I had
quite a bit of bother to get my ISDN working. The SusE distribution
includes a configuration for ISDN, but I wanted something simpler. The
stuff here was adapted from Bernhard Hailer's scripts. (Vielen, vielen
dank!)

The following rc.config loads the necessary modules during
initialisation:

<tscreen><verb>
#!/bin/bash
# This is adapted Bernhard Hailer's old script

LOCAL_NUMBER="91311234"        # tel no. 091311234
REMOTE_NUMBER="0911123456"     # ISP tel no.
LOCAL_IP="192.168.0.99"	       # I have dynamic IP so this will do
REMOTE_IP="195.112.123.11"     # your ISP's gateway
DEVICE="ippp0"

SYSPATH="/sbin"
ISDNCTRL="$SYSPATH/isdnctrl"

case "$1" in
start)
	# turn on isdn
	insmod /lib/modules/2.0.33/net/slhc.o
	insmod /lib/modules/2.0.33/misc/isdn.o
	sleep 1
	# load the hisax module

	echo "Calling ippp0"
	/sbin/isdnctrl dial ippp0
# the sleep is important as it gives the PPP time to settle down
	echo "Sleep for 8s for PPP handshake"
	sleep 8s
	/sbin/route add default ippp0
	echo "line open - checking...."
      
# check whether PPP negotiation was successful:
	set `ping -qc3 -i1 $IP_ADDRESS 2>/dev/null | grep transmitted`
