This is a fully working template for big HOWTOs. The source contains
fully described slots to make a convenient framework for you to fill in
for making your own HOWTO, suggesting some names, conventions and contents
for the chapters.

<em>My comments to the reader is in this style (emphasized)</em>.
Example lines are in plain roman style.
<em>Note that extra comments and advice is found in comments
within the SGML source.</em> <!-- such as this comment -->

For various reasons this brand new release is codenamed
the <bf/release/ release.

New code names will appear as per industry standard guidelines
to emphasize the state-of-the-art-ness of this document.

<p>
This document was written when I read a feedback asking for a
template to fill in to make new HOWTOs. This template is made
by extracting the skeletal structure of the Multi Disk HOWTO
which is a rather large HOWTO.

<em>This Template is a suggestion and a starting point, a check list
and examples for authors; it is not a requirement to be followed
slavishly. Over time HOWTOs might also outgrow any template since
in the end the goal is to inform readers efficiently.</em>

Stating the background is a simple way to getting started
writing the intro.

First of all we need a bit of legalese. Recent development shows it is
quite important.

<sect>Structure
<p>
<em>A quick overview on how all parts fit together in the structure.
Here I use an example from my Multi Disk HOWTO.</em>

As this type of document is supposed to be as much for learning
as a technical reference document I have rearranged the structure
to this end. For the designer of a system it is more useful to
have the information presented in terms of the goals of this exercise
than from the point of view of the logical layer structure of the
devices themselves. Nevertheless this document would not be complete
without such a layer structure the computer field is so full of, so
I will include it here as an introduction to how it works.

<sect1>Logical structure
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!structure, I/O subsystem</nidx>
This is based on how each layer access each other, traditionally
with the application on top and the physical layer on the bottom.
It is quite useful to show the interrelationship between each of
the layers used in controlling drives.
<tscreen><verb>
        ___________________________________________________________
        |__     File structure          ( /usr /tmp etc)        __|
        |__     File system             (ext2fs, vfat etc)      __|
        |__     Volume management       (AFS)                   __|
        |__     RAID, concatenation     (md)                    __|
        |__     Device driver           (SCSI, IDE etc)         __|
        |__     Controller              (chip, card)            __|
        |__     Connection              (cable, network)        __|
        |__     Drive                   (magnetic, optical etc) __|
        -----------------------------------------------------------

</verb></tscreen>

In the above diagram both volume management and RAID and concatenation
are optional layers. The 3 lower layers are in hardware.
All parts are discussed at length later on in this document.

<sect1>Document structure
<p>
Most users start out with a given set of hardware and some plans on
what they wish to achieve and how big the system should be. This is
the point of view I will adopt in this document in presenting the
material, starting out with hardware, continuing with design constraints
before detailing the design strategy that I have found to work well.
I have used this both for my own personal computer at home, a multi
purpose server at work and found it worked quite well. In addition my
Japanese co-worker in this project have applied the same strategy on
a server in an academic setting with similar success.

Finally at the end I have detailed some configuration tables for use
in your own design. If you have any comments regarding this or notes
from your own design work I would like to hear from you so this
document can be upgraded.
	
<sect1>Reading plan
<p>
<em>As you go beyond 50 pages or so there will be a lot of text that
experts and even the experienced do not need to read. Keeping in mind
that we wish to care for all kinds of people in the Linux world we
might have to make a reading plan. Again example follows from my
HOWTO.</em>

Although not the biggest HOWTO it is nevertheless rather big already
and I have been requested to make a reading plan to make it possible
to cut down on the volume

<descrip>
<tag/Expert/ (aka the elite). If you are familiar with Linux as well
as disk drive technologies you will find most of what you need in the
appendices. Additionally you are recommended to read the FAQ and the
<ref id="bits-n-pieces" name="Bits'n'pieces">
chapter.

<tag/Experienced/ (aka Competent). If you are familiar with computers
in general you can go straight to the chapters on
<ref id="technologies" name="technologies">
and continue from there on.

<tag/Newbie/ (mostly harmless). You just have to read the whole thing.
Sorry. In addition you are also recommended to read all the other disk
related HOWTOs.
</descrip>


<sect>Technologies <label id="technologies">
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!technologies</nidx>
<em>Introduction of technology for the newbie with a few
references to detailled works. Remember that not everyone
has Internet access so you have to explain in sufficient
details so even the newbie can get by.</em>


<sect>Implementation
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!implementation</nidx>
<em>Now your readers should have a sufficient knowledge of what
this is about and now we come to the hands on of implementing
your clever scheme.</em>


<sect>Maintenance
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!maintenance</nidx>
<em>Few systems and designs are maintenance free, here you explain
how to keep the system running.</em>


<sect>Advanced Issues
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!advanced topics</nidx>
<em>You can get most things up and running in a quick and dirty
fashion, useful for testing and getting used to how things work.
For more serious use you would need to be a little more advanced.
This is the place to explain it all, if applicable.</em>


<sect>Troubleshooting <label id="troubleshooting">
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!troubleshooting</nidx>
<em>Many problems can be solved by a simple structured approach,
analysing the symptoms, finding the cause and determining the
solution. The following is an excerpts from the Multi Disk HOWTO.</em>

<sect1>During Installation

<sect2>Locating Disks
<p>
<descrip>
<tag/Symptoms/Cannot find disk
<tag/Problem/How to find what drive letter corresponds to what disk/partition
<tag/Solution/Remember Linux does not use drive letters but device names. More
information can be found in section "Drive names".
</descrip>
<p>
<descrip>
<tag/Symptoms/Cannot partition disk
<tag/Problem/Most likely wrong input to the command line for <tt/fdisk/ or similar tool.
<tag/Solution/Remember to use <tt>/dev/hda</tt> rather than just <tt>hda</tt>. Also
do not use numbers behind <tt>hda</tt>, those indicate partitions.
</descrip>


<sect2>Formatting
<p>
<descrip>
<tag/Symptoms/Cannot format disk.
<tag/Problem/Strictly speaking you format partitions not disks.
<tag/Solution/Make sure you add the partition number after the device name
of the disk, for instance <tt>/dev/hda1</tt> to the command line.
</descrip>


<sect>Further Information
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!information resources</nidx>
<em>A HOWTO cannot describe everything, some times the user
has to venture out on the net to get more information or just
updates. Here is the place to tell where and how. Again examples
from my HOWTO, replace as needed.</em>
There is wealth of information one should go through when setting up a
major system, for instance for a news or general Internet service provider. 
The FAQs in the following groups are useful:

<sect1>News groups
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!information resources!news groups</nidx>
Some of the most interesting news groups are:
<itemize>
<item><url url="news:comp.arch.storage"                   name="Storage">.
<item><url url="news:comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware.storage"    name="PC storage">.
<item><url url="news:alt.filesystems.afs"                 name="AFS">.
<item><url url="news:comp.periphs.scsi"                   name="SCSI">.
<item><url url="news:comp.os.linux.setup"                 name="Linux setup">.
</itemize>

Most newsgroups have their own FAQ that are designed to answer most of your
questions, as the name Frequently Asked Questions indicate. Fresh versions
should be posted regularly to the relevant newsgroups. If you cannot find it
in your news spool you could go directly to the
<url url="ftp://rtfm.mit.edu"
    name="FAQ main archive FTP site">. The WWW versions can be browsed at
<url url="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/FAQ-List.html"
    name="FAQ main archive WWW site">.

Some FAQs have their own home site, of particular interest here are
<itemize>
<item><url url="http://www.paranoia.com/&tilde;filipg/HTML/LINK/F&lowbar;SCSI.html"
          name="SCSI FAQ"> and
<item><url url="http://alumni.caltech.edu/&tilde;rdv/comp&lowbar;arch&lowbar;storage/FAQ-1.html"
          name="comp.arch.storage FAQ">.
</itemize>


<sect1>Mailing Lists
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!information resources!mailing lists</nidx>
These are low noise channels mainly for developers. Think
twice before asking questions there as noise delays the development.
Some relevant lists are <tt/linux-raid/, <tt/linux-scsi/ and <tt/linux-ext2fs/.
Many of the most useful mailing lists run on the <tt>vger.rutgers.edu</tt> server
but this is notoriously overloaded, so try to find a mirror. There are some lists mirrored at
<url url="http://www.redhat.com"
    name="The Redhat Home Page">.
Many lists are also accessible at
<url url="http://www.linuxhq.com/lnxlists"
    name="linuxhq">,
and the rest of the web site is a gold mine of useful information.

If you want to find out more about the lists available you can send a message
with the line <tt/lists/ to the list server at vger.rutgers.edu (
<htmlurl url="mailto:majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu"
        name="majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu">).
If you need help on how to use the mail server just send the line <tt/help/
to the same address.
Due to the popularity of this server it is likely it takes a bit to time before
you get a reply or even get messages after you send a <tt/subscribe/ command.

There is also a number of other majordomo list servers that can be of interest
such as the EATA driver list (
<htmlurl url="mailto:linux-eata@mail.uni-mainz.de"
        name="linux-eata@mail.uni-mainz.de">)
and the Intelligent IO list
<htmlurl url="mailto:linux-i2o@dpt.com"
        name="linux-i2o@dpt.com">.

Mailing lists are in a state of flux but you can find links to a number of
interesting lists from the
<url url="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/"
    name="Linux Documentation Homepage">.


<sect1>HOWTO
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!information resources!HOWTOs</nidx>
These are intended as the primary starting points to
get the background information as well as show you how to solve
a specific problem.
Some relevant HOWTOs are <tt/Bootdisk/, <tt/Installation/,  <tt/SCSI/ and <tt/UMSDOS/.
The main site for these is the
<url url="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/"
    name="LDP archive">
at Metalab (formerly known as Sunsite).

There is a a new HOWTO out that deals with setting up a
DPT RAID system, check out the
<url url="http://www.ram.org/computing/linux/dpt&lowbar;raid.html"
    name="DPT RAID HOWTO homepage">.



<sect1>Mini-HOWTO
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!information resources!mini-HOWTOs</nidx>
These are the smaller free text relatives to the HOWTOs.
Some relevant mini-HOWTOs are
<tt/Backup-With-MSDOS/, <tt/Diskless/, <tt/LILO/, <tt/Large Disk/,
<tt/Linux+DOS+Win95+OS2/, <tt/Linux+OS2+DOS/, <tt/Linux+Win95/,
<tt/NFS-Root/, <tt/Win95+Win+Linux/, <tt/ZIP Drive/ .
You can find these at the same place as the HOWTOs, usually in a sub directory
called <tt/mini/. Note that these are scheduled to be converted into SGML and
become proper HOWTOs in the near future.

The old <tt/Linux Large IDE mini-HOWTO/ is no longer valid, instead read
<tt>/usr/src/linux/drivers/block/README.ide</tt> or
<tt>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/ide.txt</tt>.

<sect1>Local Resources
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!information resources!local</nidx>
In most distributions of Linux there is a document directory installed,
have a look in the
<htmlurl url="file:///usr/doc"
    name="/usr/doc"> directory.
where most packages store their main documentation and README files etc.
Also you will here find the HOWTO archive (
<htmlurl url="file:///usr/doc/HOWTO"
    name="/usr/doc/HOWTO">)
of ready formatted HOWTOs
and also the mini-HOWTO archive (
<url url="file:///usr/doc/HOWTO/mini"
    name="/usr/doc/HOWTO/mini">)
of plain text documents.

Many of the configuration files mentioned earlier can be found in the
<htmlurl url="file:///etc"
    name="/etc">
directory. In particular you will want to work with the
<htmlurl url="file:///etc/fstab"
    name="/etc/fstab">
file that sets up the mounting of partitions
and possibly also
<htmlurl url="file:///etc/mdtab"
    name="/etc/mdtab">
file that is used for the <tt/md/ system to set up RAID.

The kernel source in
<url url="file:///usr/src/linux"
    name="/usr/src/linux">
is, of course, the ultimate documentation. In other
words, <em>use the source, Luke</em>.
It should also be pointed out that the kernel comes not only with
source code which is even commented (well, partially at least)
but also an informative
<url url="file:///usr/src/linux/Documentation"
    name="documentation directory">.
If you are about to ask any questions about the kernel you should
read this first, it will save you and many others a lot of time
and possibly embarrassment.

Also have a look in your system log file (
<htmlurl url="file:///var/log/messages"
    name="/var/log/messages">)
to see what is going on and in particular how the booting went if
too much scrolled off your screen. Using <tt>tail -f /var/log/messages</tt>
in a separate window or screen will give you a continuous update of what is
going on in your system.

You can also take advantage of the 
<htmlurl url="file:///proc"
    name="/proc">
file system that is a window into the inner workings of your system.
Use <tt/cat/ rather than <tt/more/ to view the files as they are 
reported as being zero length. Reports are that <tt/less/ works well here.


<sect1>Web Pages
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!information resources!WWW</nidx>
<nidx>(your index root)!information resources!web pages</nidx>
There is a huge number of informative web pages out there and by their very
nature they change quickly so don't be too surprised if these links become
quickly outdated.

A good starting point is of course the
<url url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/"
    name="Linux Documentation Project"> home page,
an information central for documentation, project pages and much, much more.

Please let me know if you have any other leads that can be of interest.


<sect>Getting Help
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!assistance, obtaining</nidx>
<em>Your reader might still end up in a situation where extra help is
needed from someone else, perhaps on the net. In order to get fast and
efficient help it is best first to get some details on your system.
What details matter depends on type of problem. For disk problems you 
need to know the disk controllers etc, for networking problems you
have to know what ethernet card is used and version of drivers etc.
Here is the place to suggest what details to have ready when asking
for help.</em>

In the end you might find yourself unable to solve your problems and need
help from someone else. The most efficient way is either to ask someone
local or in your nearest Linux user group, search the web for the nearest
one.

Another possibility is to ask on Usenet News in one of the many, many
newsgroups available. The problem is that these have such a high
volume and noise (called low signal-to-noise ratio) that your question
can easily fall through unanswered.

No matter where you ask it is important to ask well or you will not be
taken seriously. Saying just <it/my disk does not work/ is not going
to help you and instead the noise level is increased even further and if
you are lucky someone will ask you to clarify.

Instead describe your problems in some detail that
will enable people to help you. The problem could lie somewhere you did
not expect. Therefore you are advised to list up the following information
on your system:

<descrip>
<tag/Hardware/
<itemize>
<item>Processor
<item>DMA
<item>IRQ
<item>Chip set (LX, BX etc)
<item>Bus (ISA, VESA, PCI etc)
<item>Expansion cards used (Disk controllers, video, IO etc)
</itemize>

<tag/Software/
<itemize>
<item>BIOS (On motherboard and possibly SCSI host adapters)
<item>LILO, if used
<item>Linux kernel version as well as possible modifications and patches
<item>Kernel parameters, if any
<item>Software that shows the error (with version number or date)
</itemize>

<tag/Peripherals/
<itemize>
<item>Type of disk drives with manufacturer name, version and type
<item>Other relevant peripherals connected to the same busses
</itemize>

</descrip>

Remember that booting text is logged to <tt>/var/log/messages</tt> which can
answer most of the questions above. Obviously if the drives fail you might not
be able to get  the log saved to disk but you can at least scroll back up the
screen using the <tt/SHIFT/ and <tt/PAGE UP/ keys. It may also be useful to
include part of this in your request for help but do not go overboard, keep
it <em/brief/ as a complete log file dumped to Usenet News is more than a
little annoying.

<sect>Questions and Answers
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!FAQ</nidx>
<nidx>(your index root)!frequently asked questions</nidx>
<em>Check the newsgroups and try to determine some frequent
problems and cover them here. Again an example from my HOWTO.</em>

This is just a collection of what I believe are the most common
questions people might have. Give me more feedback and I will
turn this section into a proper FAQ.

<itemize>

<item>Q:How many physical disk drives (spindles) does a Linux system need?
<p>
A: Linux can run just fine on one drive (spindle).  Having enough 
RAM (around 32 MB, and up to 64 MB) to support swapping is a 
better price/performance choice than getting a second disk.
(E)IDE disk is usually cheaper (but a little slower) than SCSI.

<item>Q: Are there any disadvantages in this scheme?
<p>
A: There is only a minor snag: if even a single partition overflows
the system might stop working properly. The severity depends of course
on what partition is affected. Still this is not hard to monitor, the
command <tt/df/ gives you a good overview of the situation. Also check
the swap partition(s) using <tt/free/ to make sure you are not about
to run out of virtual memory.

<item>Q: OK, so should I split the system into as many partitions
as possible for a single drive?
<p>
A: No, there are several disadvantages to that. First of all maintenance
becomes needlessly complex and you gain very little in this. In fact if your
partitions are too big you will seek across larger areas than needed.
This is a balance and dependent on the number of physical drives you have.

<em>Example designs and sample configuration files and other
relevant details is always handy. Keep large samples at the
end to avoid breaking the flow of the HOWTO reading. Small
samples are useful within the main body of the HOWTO.</em>

<p>
<em>
Not much here yet but I would like to suggest a few points.
</em>


<descrip>
<tag/Tags/ Try to use tags extensively
<tag/Types/ Try using functional tags such as em rather than it.
<tag/Files/ Try using functional links to files such as
<tt><htmlurl url="file:///usr/doc"   name="/usr/doc"></tt>
rather than just /usr/doc.
<tag/Commands/ Try to refer to man pages including section number
<tt>df (1)</tt> rather than just df.

<sect>Converting the SGML File
<p>
Having made the SGML file we are now ready to convert it to
the various output formats we need. The following is my
script to process my Multi Disk HOWTO:

<code>
sgml2txt -f disk.sgml
sgml2html disk.sgml

sgml2latex --papersize=a4 --language=english  --output=ps ~stein/doc/disk.sgml
mv disk.ps disk-A4.ps
gzip -9 disk-A4.ps

sgml2latex --papersize=letter --language=english  --output=ps ~stein/doc/disk.sgml
mv disk.ps disk-US.ps
gzip -9 disk-US.ps

</code>

The template can be converted as is, substitute "disk.sgml" with
the filename of this template to see what it looks like.

If your document is small (such as this template)
you might find it more convenient to
keep formatted versions in one single file
rather than splitting it for every chapter:

<code>
sgml2html --split=0 template.sgml
</code>
