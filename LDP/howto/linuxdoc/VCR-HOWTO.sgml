This is a guide to setting up your GNU/Linux computer as a VCR.  Setting up my VCR took a little research, but it
didn't turn out to be as difficult as I thought.  I decided to publish my results so others may benefit from what
I've done.  This is by no means the only method to achieve the same results as there are several applications out
there that may perform similar tasks.  Hopefully any unique procedures for configuring other software or devices
may be incorporated into this document.

<nidx>VCRHOWTO!technologies</nidx>
This section describes the different technologies used to build your own Linux VCR.

<sect1>Tuner or Capture Card
<p>
You will need to install a supported video4linux capture card in your computer.  I currently use the Hauppauge
WinTV tuner card which I purchased from Best Buy, but many other cards should work just as well.  I don't have
a suggestion for which is best, I can only comment that the one I own works for me.

<sect1>Kernel video4linux driver
<p>
Many GNU/Linux distributions already provide a Linux kernel that is configured to support video4linux devices.
The Hauppauge WinTV card is supported by the 'bttv' driver.  I have to load two modules into the linux kernel
to support my card, namely the 'tuner' and 'bttv' modules.  Check out the <url url="http://roadrunner.swansea.linux.org.uk/v4l.shtml" name="V4L homepage"> for details on
supported tuner cards.
<p>

<sect1>Frame Capture Software
<p>
Recording with your digital VCR of course requires frame capture software.  As I become aware of available software
for capturing audio/video to mpeg/avi formats, I will place it in this list.  If you have any suggestions for good
software please let me know and I'll add it here.

<p>
<sect>Implementation
<p>
<nidx>VCRHOWTO!implementation</nidx>
Now lets go through the steps of actually configuring your computer as a VCR.

<sect1>Install and Configure Tuner Card
<p>
My particular tuner card required special parameters to the 'tuner' and
'bttv' modules because it was an older model and wasn't properly auto-detected.
If you can watch TV through your card via xawtv, then you have correctly
configured your card.  Here are the configuration lines from my /etc/modules.conf
(or /etc/conf.modules for older distributions).
<verb>
options -k bttv radio=1 card=2
options -k tuner debug=0 type=6
</verb>
These parameters will vary depending on the model of your card, see the documentation
found in the linux source (linux/Documentation/video4linux) to figure out exactly
how to configure your card.  I added these modules to /etc/modules so they would
automatically load on bootup.  You can also manually load them with 'modprobe modulename'
as root.  I'm currently using the 2.4.2 kernel, but I have had success with this
card with all of the 2.2.x kernels as well.  Hint: the user may need to have
ownership of the /dev/video /dev/video0 files (and maybe other devices as well)
before the tuner card will function.  As always, I suggest not running any apps
as root.

<sect1>Configure xawtv to function properly.
<p>
You can either use xawtv from a reasonably current distribution, or download
the source code from the <url url="http://www.strusel007.de/linux/xawtv/" name="xawtv Homepage">
Make sure xawtv functions for your tuner card before proceeding.

<sect2>Sample .xawtv configuration file.
<p>
Here is a sample ".xawtv" configureation file.  This should be placed within the
home directory for the user who will be doing the VCR recording.  I suggest adding
presets to your .xawtv file for all channels(0-NNN) (even non-existing ones) because you
will use the "v4lctl" command to switch channels later.  This command makes use
of 'preset number' rather than 'channel number', so it's conveniant to have preset
numbers be the same as actual channel numbers.  The following configuration file
was designed for US-cable, your mileage may vary.

<p>

<sect1>Install the avifile library
<p>
Download the latest avifile package from <url url="http://divx.euro.ru" name="DiVX :-) Homepage">.
You will need avifile-0.5x and binaries-xxxxxx.zip.  You should extract the binaries to
/usr/lib/win32.  The next section describes compiling and installing avifile-0.53-5.
<p>

<sect2>Compiling and installing avifile-0.53-5
<p>
<verb>
# tar xvfz avifile-0.53-5.tar.gz
# cd avifile-0.53-5
# ./configure
# make
# make install
# mkdir /usr/lib/win32
# cd /usr/lib/win32
# unzip /path/to/binaries-010122.zip
</verb>
You will need to be root for the make install step to work.
If you receive any errors, they were probably due to a missing dependancy during
the configure step.  Resolve any dependancies and try again.  This should work
smoothly on any recent distribution that was installed with 'development' tools.
<p>

<sect1>Installing the VCR frame-grabber program
<p>
You can get the latest vcr program (vcr-1.05 at the time I wrote this) from
<url url="http://www.stack.nl/~brama/vcr/" name="The VCR Homepage">.
<p>

<sect2>Compiling and installing vcr-1.05
<p>
You will need to be root for the make install step to work.
<verb>
# tar xvfz vcr-1.05.tar.gz
# cd vcr-1.05
# ./configure
# make
# make install
<p>
</verb>

<sect2>Sample .vcrrc configuration file
<p>
By default, vcr installs everything into /usr/local (unless you changed the
prefix on the ./configure line).  You can now read the man page for
vcr with:  'man -M/usr/local/man vcr'.  This is where I got the initial
.vcrrc file.  I configured this one for my needs and added the same presets
to this file as I did with the .xawtv file.  If you think these files look
similar, it's because I believe vcr was originally based on the xawtv code base.
Here is the .vcrrc I use:

<sect1>Using cron to record your favorite program.
<p>
You may want to verify vcr will record your program before setting up cron to
record your programs.  You can test this by doing "vcr -t 2m test.avi", then
try to play back that two-minute sample using aviplay.  Note that you will need to add
'/usr/local/bin' to your path and '/usr/local/lib' to your ld library path for this
to work properly.  It was also suggested that you can use 'at' to record your
program as well, this may be useful for times when you just want to record a
program once at a specific time, but not regularly.  Here is a sample shell
script that can be called from cron:

<sect2>Sample cron shell script
<p>
This is a very simple script that merely switches to a channel and records
sixty minutes of a program to a date oriented filename.  Place this in $HOME/bin
of the user who will actually do the recording - since I am going to run it at
6pm, I'll call it recordshow6pm.sh.
<p>
<verb>
#!/bin/sh
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
export PATH

DATE=`date +%m%d%y`
FILENAME=/path/to/myshow-6pm-$DATE.avi
v4lctl setstation 3
vcr -t 60m $FILENAME
</verb>
<p>
<sect2>Calling the script from cron
<p>
Now it's time to call it from cron, monday through friday at 6pm.  To do this,
run the crontab -e command as the correct user and enter the following line:
<verb>
00 18 * * 1-5 /home/username/bin/recordshow6pm.sh
</verb>

<p>
<nidx>VCRHOWTO!FAQ</nidx>
<nidx>VCRHOWTO!frequently asked questions</nidx>

This is just a collection of what I believe are the most common
questions people might have. Give me more feedback and I will
turn this section into a proper FAQ.

<itemize>

<item>Q:Why don't I get audio when playing back recorded programs?
<p>
A: This could be due to several things.  In order for audio recording to work,
you must have the tuner card send output to the 'line-in' on your sound card.
You must also use the mixer to enable the line-in on the sound card (if you hear
sound while recording the show, it is probably enabled).  I used to have my tuner
card sound sent to my stereo receiver instead of the sound card, which was why I
didn't get sound.  Finally, it may be that the sound was recored properly, but your
sound device is in use by another program (esd, licq, xmms, etc).

<item>Q: Why is my video very jumpy?
<p>
A: This may be due to a slow CPU.  I currently haven't determined the exact
requirements for recording with this method, I'm hoping user feedback will help
me figure out what CPU is indeed required.  I have a Duron 700 that seems to work
fine, but I've heard that people with a 200-300mhz processor are unable to get
smooth video.

<item>Q: Why is the audio/video out of sync?
<p>
A: This may be due to an incorrect FPS setting for your video type.  For NTSC
you will want to use 29.97.  For PAL you will want to use 25.  I still don't
get perfect audio/video syncronization - but I can live with it.  Hopefully this
will improve over time.
