  <heading>Why this document?</heading>
  <p>
   Since there was no information anywhere on the net for Belgian Linux users, 
   we started to collect stuff that we thought could be important. This HOWTO 
   aims to be the definitive list of all Belgian-related Linux information. If
   you think not, you have no excuse to complain and certainly not to not 
   contribute. ;)

  <heading>Keyboard setup</heading>
  <p>
   Linux provides 2 ways to set up your keyboard. At the console you can use 
   <tt>loadkeys</tt> and under XFree86 you can use <tt>xmodmap</tt>.
  </p>
 
  <sect2>
   <heading>Console</heading>
   <p>
    To use the keytable for a Belgian keyboard you can use
    <verb>
	loadkeys be2-latin1
    </verb>
    or
    <verb>
	loadkeys be-latin1
    </verb>
    The only difference between the two is that be2-latin1 add support for 
    twosuperior and threesuperior (keycode 41) and grave (keycode 43).
   </p>

   <p>
    Usually <tt>loadkeys</tt> is started at boottime from the scripts located 
    somewhere in <em>/etc/rc.d</em> Different distributions handle it 
    differentely. But most distributions have a simple program (like 
    <tt>kbdconfig</tt> in RedHat or <tt>yast</tt> in SuSE) to change the 
    scripts.
   </p>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <heading>XFree86</heading>
   <p>
    To set your keyboard properly under XFree86 you've got more choices.  By 
    running <tt>Xconfigurator</tt> (or a similar program) a config-file for 
    XFree86 is created (with some standard content). This file is called 
    <em>XF86Config</em> and is usually located in <em>/etc</em> or 
    <em>/etc/X11</em>
   </p>

   <p>
    Make sure (and change otherwise) that something similar to this is given
    under the <tt>Keyboard Section</tt>.
    <verb>
	Section "Keyboard"
	        Protocol        "Standard"
		XkbRules	"xfree86"
	        XkbModel	"pc101"
	        XkbLayout	"be"
	EndSection
    </verb>
   </p>

   <p>
    If you own a 'microsoft' keyboard (or the less-known penguin keyboards ;p)
    you can enable those extra 3 keys by changing the <tt>"pc101"</tt> into 
    <tt>"pc104"</tt>. (I use the extra keys as meta-keys in my windowmanager so
    some shortcuts doesn't conflict with the internal ones of my wm).
   </p>

   <p>
    To get the AltGr key to work under XFree86 simply add in the 
    <tt>Keyboard Section:</tt>

    <verb>
		RightAlt	ModeShift
    </verb>
   </p>

   <p>
    To get some key-combinations working under X11, you might want to change in 
    file <em>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb/symbols/be</em>:
    <verb>
        key <AD11> {	[ dead_circumflex,       diaeresis 	],
			[     bracketleft			]	};
	key <AC11> {	[          ugrave,         percent 	],
			[      quoteright 			]	};
	key <BKSL> {	[              mu,        sterling 	],
			[       quoteleft			]	};
	key <AB10> {	[           equal,            plus	],
			[      asciitilde			]	};
    </verb>
    by
    <verb>
	key <AD11> {	[ dead_circumflex,  dead_diaeresis 	],
			[     bracketleft			]	};
	key <AC11> {	[          ugrave,         percent 	],
			[      dead_acute 			]	};
	key <BKSL> {	[              mu,        sterling 	],
			[      dead_grave			]	};
	key <AB10> {	[           equal,            plus	],
			[      dead_tilde			]	};
    </verb>
   </p>

   <p>
    Some people prefer to use a 'compose'-key to enter their special characters, like:
    <verb>
   	<compose>'e => &eacute;
	<compose>/o => &oslash;
	<compose>c, => &ccedil;
	<compose>co => &copy;
	<compose>ss => &szlig;
    </verb>

    Solution:
    <verb>
   	xmodmap -e "keycode xx = Multi_key"
    </verb>
    or
    <verb>
   	xmodmap -e "keysym yy = Multi_key"
    </verb>
    and 'xx' is the keycode and 'yy' the kesym of the key you choose to be the 'compose'-key.
    (use <tt>xev</tt> to get these values)

    Alternatively you can add
    <verb>
   	keycode xx = Multi_key
    </verb>
    to your <em>~/.xmodmaprc</em>. This way it happens automagically.
   </p>
  </sect2>
 </sect1>

 <sect1>
  <heading>Display and applications</heading>
  <p>
   Some applications have to be compiled as 8-bit clean to work well with the 
   European characterset. Others like to be told in advance.
  </p>

  <sect2>
   <heading>Using the ISO-8859-1 font in console</heading>
   <p>
    You can load the ISO-8859-1 font by typing the following in console:
    <verb>
	setfont lat1u-16.psf
	mapscrn trivial
	echo -ne '\033(K'
    </verb>
   </p>

   <p>
    To be able to use &euml;, &egrave;, &eacute; or &ccedil; in console, you 
    might want to add these to your <em>~/.inputrc</em>:
    <verb>
	set meta-flag on
	set convert-meta off
	set output-meta on
    </verb>

    (this must be done for every user, if you want this to be default for all
    users you can either add this file to <em>/etc/skel/</em> or you could add 
    these lines to <em>/etc/inputrc</em> and add the following line to 
    <em>/etc/bashrc</em>,

    <verb>
	export INPUTRC=/etc/inputrc
    </verb>

    )
   </p>

   <p>
    <bf>Note:</bf> this is only useful to programs that use readline (like bash)
    Also set the following environment variables:
    <verb>
   	LC_CTYPE=iso-8859-1
	SYSFONT=lat1u-16.psf
	SYSTERM=linux
    </verb>
   </p>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <heading>Support for the Euro symbol</heading>
   <p>
    Since Europe had to invent a new character, the Euro, there's a new 
    standard. It's called ISO-8859-15 (aka Latin-9 or Latin-0). To add support
    you need both a new font and new keymaps.  This is part of every major
    distribution nowadays, if you have an older distributions you probably 
    need a newer <tt>console-tools</tt> package.
   </p>

   <p>
    The changes in the keymap-file consist of the following lines:
    <verb>
	keycode  18 = +e	+E	currency
	keycode  46 = +c	+C	cent
    </verb>

    And the following environment-variable should be set:
    <verb>
	SYSFONT=lat0-16.psf
    </verb>
    to make sure you're using the right font.
   </p>
  </sect2>
 </sect1>
 <sect1>
  <heading>Time zone</heading>
  <p>
   Since Belgium is located in the Central European Time zone (aka MET) which 
   (in the winter) is equivalent to the Greenwhich Mean Time plus 1 (GMT+1), 
   you can simply link <em>/usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime/MET</em> to 
   <em>/etc/localtime</em> symbolicly like: 
   <verb>
        ln -sf /usr/lib/zoneinfo/MET /etc/localtime
   </verb>
   or 
   <verb>
        ln -sf /usr/lib/zoneinfo/Europe/Brussels /etc/localtime
   </verb>
   This automagically sets Daylight Savings (which is GMT+2 in the summer). 
  </p>

  <p>
   <bf>Note:</bf> that different distributions have different paths, zoneinfo
   can be located in <em>/usr/share</em> or such...

   <bf>Note2:</bf> RedHat uses a tool called <tt>timeconfig</tt>, SuSE uses 
   <tt>yast</tt>
  </p>

  <p>
   To change the CMOS clock and then synchronize the system time with the CMOS 
   clock, do something like this: 
   <verb>
        hwclock --set --date="Feb 25 03:38"
        clock -u -s
   </verb>

   If your clock is set to local time (which is discouraged but if you have 
   other OS's installed a must), you can do: 
   <verb>
        hwclock --set --date="Feb 25 04:38"
        clock -s
   </verb>
   [Noticed the 1 hour difference ? ;p]

  <heading>Locale support</heading>
  <p>
   Not much programs support locale yet, if you want to know more about locale 
   or how to write your own programs to support it, check: [put the damn url 
   here ;p]
  </p>

  <p>
   Be aware that locale makes it harder to resolve problems as less people can 
   help you !! You might understand a problem when it's in technical English, 
   but what if it's translated in some obscure French ?!? Some obviously won't 
   understand both. ;p
  </p>

  <sect2>
   <heading>Dutch</heading>
   <p>
    To enable support for the Dutch locale in Belgium on a system with locale 
    support you just have to set the following environment variables: 
    <verb>
	LANG=nl
	LANGUAGE=nl_BE
    </verb>
    Try <tt>nl_BE.ISO_8859-1</tt> if <tt>nl_BE</tt> does not work.
   </p>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <heading>French</heading>
   <p>
    If you want French locale support in Belgium, set the following environment 
    variabels:
    <verb>
	LANG=fr
	LANGUAGE=fr_BE
    </verb>
    Try <tt>fr_BE.ISO_8859-1</tt> if <tt>fr_BE</tt> does not work. 
   </p>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <heading>German</heading>
   <p>
    If you want instead German locale support in Belgium, set the following 
    environment variabels:
    <verb>
	LANG=de
	LANGUAGE=de_BE
    </verb>
    Try <tt>de_BE.ISO_8859-1</tt> if <tt>de_BE</tt> does not work. 
   </p>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <heading>Walloon</heading>
   <p>
    For Walloon locale support you can find files and information at:
    <url url="http://www.linuxi18n.org/locales/walon/">. To use it set:
    <verb>
	LANG=wa
	LANGUAGE=wa_BE:fr_BE
    </verb>
    Try <tt>wa_BE.ISO_8859-1</tt> if <tt>wa_BE</tt> does not work. 
   </p>
  </sect2>
 </sect1>

 <sect1>
  <heading>Native language support and codepages</heading>
  <p>
   These options add support for the Belgian characterset and codepages. If 
   you'd like to have these, compile a kernel with these options put on. They 
   only apply to some filesystems (FAT-based, ISO9660, ...).
   <verb>
	< > Codepage 850 (Europe) 
	< > NLS ISO 8859-1  (Latin 1; Western European Languages)  
	< > NLS ISO 8859-15 (Latin 9; Western European Languages with Euro)
   </verb>
   Located in <tt>Filesystems</tt> > <tt>Native Language Support</tt>
  </p>

  <p>
   If your kernel is a modular kernel that came with your distribution 
   (=you never compiled a kernel before), then you might want to type:
   <verb>
	insmod nls_cp850
	insmod nls_iso8859_1
	insmod nls_iso8859_15

   <heading>Configuring the modem</heading>
   <p>
    To configure your modem, you can alter the initstring of your modem. To

    <url url="http://www.spy.net/~dustin/modem/" name="Ask Mr. Modem">.
   </p>

   <p>
    <bf>Beware</bf>: if you have a winmodem you will probably not get it to
    work. More information about winmodems is at: 
    <url url="http://linmodems.org/">. Work is underway, but winmodems are
    not as good as <em>real</em> modems.

   <heading>Installing pppd</heading>
   <p>
    Now, you need to have the ppp-package installed (check this by typing 
    <tt>pppd --version</tt>), make sure you have a recent one. Then you have to
    make sure you've got these files:
   </p>

   <p>
    <em>/usr/local/bin/ppp</em>
    <verb>
	#!/bin/sh
	case $1 in

    You can remove the <tt>-v</tt> once everything looks normal.
   </p>

   <p>
    The pppd command uses <em>/etc/ppp/options</em> to list its options, change 
    these options to whatever fits. These defaults normally work in most cases.

    </verb>
    Once dialing in works like a charm, you can leave <tt>debug</tt> out.
   </p>

   <p>
    <bf>Beware:</bf> it is important to emphasize that every special character,
    thus every character that is not [a-ZA-Z0-9] and '_', should be escaped by
    preceding it with a '\'-character. Thus "e!b$l+" would become "e\!b\$l\+".
    Try it if you are having troubles !

   <heading>pap-secrets / chap-secrets</heading>
   <p>
    If your ISP requires CHAP or PAP, you need one of these files with their
    proper username and password:
   </p>

   <p>
    <em>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</em> or <em>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</em>
    <verb>
	#client		server  secret          IP

  <sect2>
   <heading>Network</heading>
   <p>
    To configure your nameservers, change <em>/etc/resolv.conf</em>. If dialing
    in is succesfull, but you can't get it to connect to URL's: this is probably
    the cause.

    Before you can run a (shell)script, it must be set executable. Be sure
    that you set the permissions so that other users cannot see the passwords
    stored in the files. If you want other users to be able to dial in, you
    might want to consider using <tt>sudo</tt>. You might want to do the 
    following:
    <verb>
     chmod u+rw og-rwx -R /etc/ppp
     chmod u+x /etc/ppp/ppp-on-dialer /usr/local/bin/ppp
    </verb>
   </p>

   <heading>Dial + Hangup</heading>
   <p>
    Then if <em>/usr/local/bin</em> is in your <tt>PATH</tt>, you can easily 
    dial in with:
    <verb>
	ppp on
    </verb>
    and hangup with:
    <verb>
	ppp off
    </verb>
    and to get some statistics, you do:
    <verb>
    	ppp status
    </verb>

   This section does not aim to be a definitive guide on ISDN for Linux. For a
   more detailed discussion on the topic, see 
   <htmlurl url="http://www.wurtel.demon.nl/" name="Paul Slootman's ISDN4Linux HOWTO"> 
   and <htmlurl url="http://www.isdn4linux.de/faq/"  name="ISDN4Linux-FAQ">.

   <heading>Updating the kernel</heading>
   <p>
    If you're using a 2.2 kernel, it's recommended to get an updated version of
    the ISDN code. You can retrieve the CVS at 
    <url url="ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/isdn4linux/">. 
    For more information, check: 
    <url url="http://www.brisse.dk/site/linux/docs/isdn.htm">
   </p>

   <p>
    <bf>Warning:</bf> if you've recently purchased an Eicon Diva 2.0 PCI (eg,
    via Belgacom), there's a good chance you've actually got a Diva 2.01.In 
    this case, you must get a version dated 1 July 1999 or later !
   </p>

   <p>
    Once the ISDN is in place, you can start up the driver. Eg:
    <verb>
	modprobe hisax type=11 protocol=2 
    </verb>
    Refer to the Readme's for the right parameters and values for your card. 
   </p>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <heading>ISDN4Linux toolkit</heading>
   <p>
    Next, you'll need the ISDN4Linux toolkit.  You can retrieve the latest
    version of the toolkit at: <url url="ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/isdn4linux/">
   </p>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <heading>Configuring the interface</heading>
   <p>
    With the tools installed and configured, write a script to configure the
    interface, to be used for the ISDN connection. As always in Linux, there's
    no one correct way of doing this. I've put these in a script 
   </p>
  
   <p>
    <em>/etc/rc.d/rc.isdn</em>:
    <verb>
	#!/bin/sh
	MSNREMOTE='555-1212'	# Phone number of ISP
	MSNLOCAL='555-1313'	# my number, without 0, with areacode
	ACCOUNT='george'	# The account for logon (as 'George Burns')
	IPLOCAL=10.0.0.2	# my fixed IP (use 10.0.0.2 if no fixed)
	IPREMOTE=0.0.0.0	# IP number of ISP
	INTERFACE=ippp0
	/sbin/modprobe hisax type=11 protocol=2
	/sbin/isdnctrl verbose 3 system on
	/sbin/isdnctrl addif $IF
	/sbin/isdnctrl secure $IF on 
	/sbin/isdnctrl addphone $IF out $MSNREMOTE
	/sbin/isdnctrl eaz $IF $MSNLOCAL
	/sbin/isdnctrl huptimeout $IF 300
	/sbin/isdnctrl l2_prot $IF hdlc
	/sbin/isdnctrl l3_prot $IF trans
	/sbin/isdnctrl encap $IF syncppp
#	/sbin/isdnctrl dialmode $IF auto
	/sbin/ifconfig $IF $IPLOCAL pointopoint $IPREMOTE -arp -broadcast
	/sbin/ipppd /dev/ippp0 user $ACCOUNT $IPLOCAL:$IPREMOTE
    </verb>
   </p>

   <p>
    To start this at boot time, make it executable and append the following to
    <em>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</em>:
    <verb>
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.isdn ]; then
		. /etc/rc.d/rc.isdn
	fi
    </verb>
   </p>

   <p>
    The ipppd command gets its parameters passed through a file, 
    <em>/etc/ppp/ioptions</em>:
    <verb>
	-ac
	-bsdcomp
	debug
	defaultroute
	ipcp-accept-local
	ipcp-accept-remote
	mru 1524
	mtu 1500
	noipdefault
	-pc
	useifip
	-vj
	-vjccomp

	#idle 360
	#persistent
    </verb>
   </p>

   <p>
    <bf>Warning:</bf> do NOT specify +pap or +chap in this file. This specifies
    the authentication that ipppd should use for an INCOMING client. If you were
    to use this to connect to your ISP, ipppd would wait for the ISP to 
    authenticate itself using the specified protocol.
   </p>

   <p>
    <bf>Beware:</bf> it is important to emphasize that every special character,
    thus every character that is not [a-ZA-Z0-9] and '_' should be escaped by
    preceding it with a '\'-character. Thus 'e!b$l+' would become 'e\!b\$l\+'.
    Try it if you are having troubles !
   </p>

   <p>
    Finally, create <em>/etc/ppp/ip-down.local</em> to handle the shutdown of
    the interface:
    <verb>
	#!/bin/sh
	/sbin/ifconfig $1 down
	sleep 1
	/sbin/ifconfig $1 10.0.0.2 pointopoint 
    </verb>
   </p>

   <p>
    <bf>Note:</bf> this is to handle some problems with routes on shutdowns. 
    Anyone know of a clean(er) solution ?
   </p>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <heading>pap-secrets / chap-secrets</heading>
   <p>
    If your ISP uses PAP or CHAP, create a file <em>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</em>
    or <em>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</em>. Its format is:
    <verb>
	#client		server  secret          IP      
	your_login	*	your_pass	*
    </verb>
   </p>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <heading>Network</heading>
   <p>
    Not really related to ISDN, but a lot of people forget this step (too eager
    to try out all the stuff they typed in above ? :-)).
   </p>

   <p>
    Anyway, you need to configure the DNS, by creating a file 
    <em>/etc/resolv.conf</em>:
    <verb>
	domain your_domain_of_your_isp
	nameserver your_primary_nameserver
	nameserver your_secondary_nameserver
    </verb>
   </p>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <heading>File permissions</heading>
   <p>
    Before you can run a (shell)script, it must be set executable. Be sure
    that you set the permissions so that other users cannot see the passwords
    stored in the files. If you want other users to be able to dial in, you
    might want to consider using <tt>sudo</tt>. You might want to do the 
    following:
    <verb>
     chmod u+rw og-rwx -r /etc/ppp
     chmod u+x /etc/rc.d/rc.isdn /etc/ppp/ip.down-local /usr/local/bin/isdn
    </verb>
   </p>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <heading>Dial + Hangup</heading>
   <p>
    Finally, you can write a little wrapper to start and stop the ISDN 
    connection. I've put this as <em>/usr/local/bin/isdn</em>:
    <verb>
	#!/bin/bash
	case $1 in
		on|start)
		/sbin/isdnctrl dial ippp0
		;;
		off|stop)
		/sbin/isdnctrl hangup ippp0
		;;
		info|status)
		/sbin/isdnctrl list ippp0
		;;
		*)
		echo "Usage: isdn on|off|info|start|stop|status"
		;;
	esac
    </verb>
   </p>

   <p>
    Then if <em>/usr/local/bin</em> is in your <tt>PATH</tt>, you can easily 
    dial in with:
    <verb>
	isdn on
    </verb>
    and hangup with:
    <verb>
	isdn off
    </verb>
   </p>
  </sect2>

  <heading>Cablemodem (DHCP)</heading>
  <p>
   DHCP was designed to make life easier, and most of the times it does ;) More
   information to set up your DHCP client can be found at: 
   <url url="http://www.oswg.org/oswg-nightly/DHCP.html"> and a list of
   Frequently Asked Questions at: <url url="http://web.syr.edu/~jmwobus/comfaqs/dhcp.faq.html">
   which describes everything you need to know. Along with the information 
   in the Cable-Modem HOWTO 
   (<url url="http://www.oswg.org/oswg-nightly/Cable-Modem.html">).
  </p>

  <p>
   Lots of people want to connect a whole network to their cablemodem, that's
   not a problem. You'll need IP-Masquerading 
   (<url url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/IP-Masquerade-HOWTO.html">)
   and make sure the interface (that speaks to the cablemodem) has the right 
   MAC-address !! Another solution (in case of problems) is to reset your
   cablemodem.

   As Dutch is less wide-spread, it is the least supported. But work is being

   translations obviously are already taken care of.

    A succesfull initiative is making progress, but there's still a lot to do.

   The fastest medium to get support is IRC, but beware. Because IRC is rather
   anonymous it's also easy to fool people.

   On IRCnet there's a channel called #linux.be that is closely related to bcol
   and the Belgian Linux-scene. The channel is still small, but it surely will
   grow in time. To get help in English, there's only one place #linux.
